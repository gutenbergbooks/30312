<h2>CARMEN ARIZA</h2>
<div class='chsp' style='padding-top:0'>
<a name='CHAPTER_1' id='CHAPTER_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
</div>
<p>The tropical sun mounted the rim of the golden Caribbean,
quivered for a moment like a fledgeling preening its wings
for flight, then launched forth boldly into the vault of
heaven, shattering the lowering vapors of night into a myriad
fleecy clouds of every form and color, and driving them before
it into the abysmal blue above. Leaping the sullen walls of old
Cartagena, the morning beams began to glow in roseate hues
on the red-tiled roofs of this ancient metropolis of New
Granada, and glance in shafts of fire from her glittering domes
and towers. Swiftly they climbed the moss-grown sides of
church and convent, and glided over the dull white walls of
prison and monastery alike. Pouring through half-turned shutters,
they plashed upon floors in floods of gold. Tapping
noiselessly on closed portals, they seemed to bid tardy sleepers
arise, lest the hurrying midday <i>siesta</i> overtake them with tasks
unfinished. The dormitory of the ecclesiastical college, just
within the east wall of the city, glowed brilliantly in the clear
light which it was reflecting to the mirror of waters without.
Its huge bulk had caught the first rays of the rising sun, most
of which had rebounded from its drab, incrusted walls and
sped out again over the dancing sea. A few, however, escaped
reflection by stealing through the slanting shutters of a window
close under the roof of the building. Within, they fell upon a
man kneeling on the tiled floor beside a rude cot bed.</p>
<p>In appearance the man was not more than twenty-five years
of age. His black, close-curling hair, oval face, and skin of
deep olive tint indicated a Latin origin. His clerical garb
proclaimed him a son of the Church. The room was a small,
whitewashed cell of stone, musty with the dampness which had
swept in from the sea during the night. It was furnished with
Spartan simplicity. Neither image, crucifix, nor painting
adorned its walls&ndash;&ndash;the occupant&rsquo;s dress alone suggested his
calling. A hanging shelf held a few books, all evidently used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page4' name='book1_page4'></a>4</span>
as texts in the adjoining college. A table, much littered; a
wooden dressing stand, with a small mirror; and an old-fashioned,
haircloth trunk, bearing numerous foreign labels,
eked out the paucity of furnishings.</p>
<p>If the man prayed, there was only his reverent attitude to
indicate it, for no words escaped his lips. But the frequent
straining of his tense body, and the fierce clenching of his
thin hands, as he threw his arms out over the unopened bed,
were abundant evidence of a soul tugging violently at its
moorings. His was the attitude of one who has ceased to
inveigh against fate, who kneels dumbly before the cup of
Destiny, knowing that it must be drained.</p>
<p>With the break of day the bells awoke in the church towers
throughout the old city, and began to peal forth their noisy
reminder of the virility of the Holy Catholic faith. Then the
man raised his head, seemingly startled into awareness of his
material environment. For a few moments he listened confusedly
to the insistent clatter&ndash;&ndash;but he made no sign of the
cross, nor did his head bend with the weight of a hollow <i>Ave</i> on
his bloodless lips while the clamoring muezzins filled the
warm, tropical air with their jangling appeal. Rising with an
air of weary indifference, he slowly crossed the room and threw
wide the shutters of the solitary window, admitting a torrent of
sunlight. As he did this, the door of the cell softly opened, and
a young novitiate entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission, Padre,&rdquo; said the boy, bowing low.
&ldquo;His Grace summons you to the Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man made a languid gesture of dismissal, and turned
from the lad to the rare view which greeted him through the
open window. The dusty road below was beginning to manifest
the city&rsquo;s awakening. Barefooted, brown-skinned women,
scantily clad in cheap calico gowns, were swinging along with
shallow baskets under their arms to the <i>plaza</i> for the day&rsquo;s
marketing. Some carried naked babes astride their hips;
some smoked long, slender cigars of their own rolling. Half-clad
children of all ages, mixtures of <i>mestizo</i>, Spaniard, and
Jamaican negro, trotted along beside them; and at intervals a
blustering <i>cochero</i> rattled around the corner in a rickety,
obsolete type of trap behind a brace of emaciated horses.</p>
<p>The lively gossip of the passing groups preluded the noisy
chaffering to follow their arrival at the market place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, little pig!&rdquo; shrilled a buxom matron, snatching
her naked offspring away from a passing vehicle. &ldquo;Think you
I have money to waste on Masses for your naughty soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, se&ntilde;ora</i>,&rdquo; bantered another, &ldquo;it will cost less now than
later to get him out of purgatory.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page5' name='book1_page5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>comadre</i>, do you stop at the Cathedral to say a <i>Pater-noster</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, <i>amiga</i>, and an <i>Ave</i>, too. And let us return by
way of the Hotel Espa&ntilde;a, for, <i>quien sabe</i>? we may catch a
glimpse of the famous <i>matador</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Varilla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He arrived from Barranquilla last night&ndash;&ndash;so my
Pedro tells me&ndash;&ndash;and will fight in the arena this Sunday. I have
saved fifty <i>pesos</i> to see him. <i>Madre de Dios!</i> but I would sell
my soul to see him slay but a single bull. And do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God willing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft air, tempered by the languid ocean breeze, bore
aloft the laughter and friendly bantering of the marketers,
mingled with the awakening street sounds and the morning
greetings which issued from opening doors and windows. The
scent of roses and the heavier sweetness of orchids and tropical
blooms drifted over the ancient city from its innumerable
<i>patios</i> and public gardens. The age-incrusted buildings fused
in the mounting sun into squares of dazzling white, over which
the tiled roofs flowed in cinctures of crimson. Far off at sea
the smoke of an approaching vessel wove fantastic designs
against the tinted sky. Behind the city the convent of Santa
Candelaria, crowning the hill of La Popa, glowed like a diamond;
and stretching far to the south, and merging at the foot
of the <i>Cordilleras</i> into the gloom-shrouded, menacing jungle,
the steaming llanos offered fleeting glimpses of their rich
emerald color as the morning breeze stirred the heavy clouds
of vapor which hung sullenly above them.</p>
<p>To all this the man, looking vacantly out across the city
walls to where the sea birds dipped on the rippling waves, was
apparently oblivious. Nor did he manifest the slightest interest
in the animated scene before him until a tall, heavy-set young
priest emerged from the entrance of the dormitory below and
stopped for a moment in the middle of the road to bask in the
brilliant sunlight and fill his lungs with the invigorating ocean
breeze. Turning his eyes suddenly upward, the latter caught
sight of the man at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>amigo</i> Jos&egrave;!&rdquo; he called in friendly greeting, his handsome
face aglow with a cordial smile. &ldquo;Our good Saint Claver
has not lobbied for us in vain! We shall yet have a good day
for the bulls, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent one, I think, Wenceslas,&rdquo; quickly replied the
man addressed, who then turned abruptly away as if he wished
to avoid further conversation. The priest below regarded the
empty window for a moment. Then, with a short, dry laugh
and a cynical shrug of his broad shoulders, he passed on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page6' name='book1_page6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>As the man above turned back into the room his face, wearing
the look of one far gone in despair, was contorted with
passion. Fear, confusion, and undefined soul-longing seemed to
move rapidly across it, each leaving its momentary impression,
and all mingling at times in a surging flood that swelled the
veins of his temples to the point of rupture. Mechanically he
paced his narrow cell, throwing frequent furtive glances at the
closed door, as if he suspected himself watched. Often he
stopped abruptly, and with head bowed and brows furrowed,
seemed to surrender his soul to the forces with which it was
wrestling. Often he clasped his head wildly in his hands and
turned his beseeching eyes upward, as if he would call upon an
invisible power above to aid him, yet restrained by the deadening
conviction of experience that such appeal would meet with
no response, and that he must stand in his own strength, however
feeble.</p>
<p>Hours passed thus. The sun gained the zenith and the
streets were ablaze. Belated marketers, with laden baskets atop
their heads, were hurrying homeward, hugging the scanty shade
of the glaring buildings. Shopkeepers were drawing their shutters
and closing their heavy doors, leaving the hot noon hour
asleep on the scorching portals. The midday <i>Angelus</i> called
from the Cathedral tower. Then, as if shaken into remembrance
of the message which the boy had brought him at daybreak,
the man hurriedly took his black felt hat from the table,
and without further preparation left the room.</p>
<p>The stone pavements and narrow brick walks, above which
the intense heat hung in tremulous waves, were almost deserted
as he hastened toward the Cathedral. The business of the
morning was finished; trade was suspended until the sun, now
dropping its fiery shafts straight as plummets, should have
sunk behind La Popa. As he turned into the Calle Lozano an
elderly woman, descending the winding brick stairway visible
through the open door of one of the numerous old colonial
houses in the lower end of this thoroughfare, called timidly to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marcelena,&rdquo; the priest returned, stopping. &ldquo;The girl&ndash;&ndash;is
she&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is dying,&rdquo; interrupted the woman in a voice broken
with sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying! Then the child&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, born an hour ago&ndash;&ndash;a boy. It lives. Ah, <i>Santa
Virgen</i>, such suffering! Pray for us, Mother of God!&rdquo; murmured
the weeping woman, bending her head and repeatedly
making the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is with her now?&rdquo; the priest continued hurriedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page7' name='book1_page7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Only Catalina. The doctor said he would return. He is
good to the blessed child. And Padre Lorenzo came&ndash;&ndash;but he
would not shrive her little white soul&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the father&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not know,&rdquo; the woman sobbed. &ldquo;Who would dare
to tell him! Think you he would come? That he would own
the babe? He would not give one blessed candle to set beside
the little mother&rsquo;s poor sweet body! Ah, <i>Santa Maria</i>! who will
buy Masses for her little soul? Who&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he <i>shall</i> know!&rdquo; cried the priest, his face livid. &ldquo;And
he shall acknowledge his child and care for it! <i>Dios&ndash;&ndash;!</i> But
wait, Marcelena. I can do nothing now. But I will return.&rdquo;
Leaving the woman sobbing prayers to the Virgin Mother, the
priest hurried on.</p>
<p>Within the Cathedral the cool atmosphere met him with a
sweet calm, which flowed over his perturbed soul like a benediction.
He drew a chair from a pile in a corner and sat down
for a moment near one of the little side chapels, to recover from
the stifling heat without and prepare his thought for the impending
interview with the Bishop. A dim twilight enveloped
the interior of the building, affording a grateful relief from the
blinding glare of the streets. It brought him a transient sense
of peace&ndash;&ndash;the peace which his wearied soul had never fully
known. Peace brooded over the great nave, and hovered in the
soft air that drifted slowly through the deserted aisle up to the
High Altar, where lay the Sacred Host. A few votive candles
were struggling to send their feeble glow through the darkness.
The great images of the suffering Christ, of the Saints and the
Virgin Mother had merged their outlines into the heavy shadows
which lay upon them.</p>
<p>The haunting memory of years of soul-struggle with doubt
and fear, of passionate longing for the light of truth in the
gloom of superstition and man-made creeds, for guidance
among the devious paths of human conjecture which lead
nowhither&ndash;&ndash;or to madness&ndash;&ndash;seemed to fade into the darkness
which wrapped him in that holy calm. After all, what had he
won in his lifelong warfare with human beliefs? What had he
gained by his mad opposition to Holy Church? There she stood,
calm, majestic, undisturbed. Had not the Christ himself declared
that the gates of hell should not prevail against her?
Was not the unfoldment of truth a matter, not of years, but of
ages? And were the minds of men to-day prepared for higher
verities than those she offered? Did not the Church plant the
seed as rapidly as the barren soil of the human mind was tilled
and made fallow? True, her sons, whom he had so obstinately
opposed, were blindly zealous. But were they wholly without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page8' name='book1_page8'></a>8</span>
wisdom? Had not his own zeal been as unreasoningly directed
to the forcing of events? And still, through it all, she had held
her indulgent arms extended to him, as to all erring mankind.
Why not now, like a tired child, weary of futile resistance, yield
to her motherly embrace and be at last at peace? Again the
temptation which he had stubbornly resisted for a lifetime
urged upon him with all its mesmeric insistence.</p>
<p>He looked up, and his glance fell upon a small, glass-covered
case, dimly visible in the uncertain light at one side of
the little altar. The case was filled with tiny images of gold&ndash;&ndash;<i>milagros</i>.
Each had received priestly blessing, and each was
believed to have worked a miraculous cure. The relaxed lines
of the priest&rsquo;s care-worn face instantly drew into an expression
of hard austerity. Like the ebb of the ocean, his recalcitrant
thought surged back again in a towering flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a spectacle!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Holy Church, assuming
spiritual leadership of the world, sunken in idolatry, and
publicly parading her fetishism in these lingering echoes of
primitive demon-worship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, the Master taught the omnipotence of God, whose ways
he declared as high above the blind grovelings of man as the
dome of heaven swings above earth. But how long, gentle
Master, shall such as this be declared thy Father&rsquo;s ways? How
long shall superstition and idolatry retain the power to fetter
the souls of men? Is there no end to the black curse of ignorance
of Truth, which, after untold centuries, still makes men
sink with vain toil and consume with disease? And&ndash;&ndash;are those
who sit about Peter&rsquo;s gorgeous tomb and approve these things
unerring guides to a right knowledge of God, to know whom,
the Christ has said, is life eternal?</p>
<p>A step behind him broke the flow of his dark revery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our good Jos&egrave; dreams below, while His Grace bites his
nails above,&rdquo; said a soft, mellifluous voice. &ldquo;<i>Qu&eacute; chiste!</i> It is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest sprang to his feet and faced the speaker. For a
moment the men regarded each other, the one uncertain as to
the impending event, but supremely confident of his ability to
meet it; the other sick in soul and torn with mental struggle,
but for the moment fired anew with the righteous wrath which
his recent brief interview with the woman, Marcelena, had
kindled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wenceslas&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The priest spoke in a strained, uncertain
tone, striving to hold his emotions in leash. &ldquo;I have learned
to-day&ndash;&ndash;The girl, Maria&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caro amigo</i>,&rdquo; interrupted Wenceslas smoothly, &ldquo;what you
have learned to-day, or any other day, of the girl, Maria, is a
lie.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page9' name='book1_page9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; The priest turned livid. Stepping closer to
Wenceslas&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, inhuman! that I have not long known of
your relations with this girl? Who has not! And, further, I
know&ndash;&ndash;and Cartagena shall know&ndash;&ndash;that to-day she lies dying
beside your child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas recoiled. His face flushed, and the veins of his
forehead swelled with a purple flood. Then a pallor spread
over his features, and beads of perspiration started from his
pores.</p>
<p>It was but momentary. Recovering himself, he laid a large
hand on the priest&rsquo;s shoulder, and, his face assuming its wonted
smile, said in his usual low tone, &ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>, it seems that you
have a penchant for spreading gossip. Think you I am ignorant
of the fact that because of it Rome spewed you out for a meddlesome
pest? Do you deceive yourself that Cartagena will
open her ears to your garbled reports? The hag, Marcelena,
lies! She has long hoped to gain some advantage from me, I
have told you&ndash;&ndash; But go now above and learn from His Grace,
whom you have had the impudence to keep waiting all morning,
how tongues that wag too freely can be silenced.&rdquo; He
checked himself suddenly, as if he feared he had said too much.
Then, turning on his heel, he quickly left the Cathedral.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast, and he stood, infirm
of purpose and choking with words which he could not voice.
The whirl in which his confused brain had revolved for months&ndash;&ndash;nay,
years&ndash;&ndash;had made the determination of conduct with
him a matter of hours, of days, of weeks. Spontaneity of action
had long since ceased within his fettered mind, where doubt
had laid its detaining hand upon his judgment. Uncertainty of
his steps, fear of their consequence, and dread lest he precipitate
the calamity which he felt hung always just above him,
had sapped the courage and strength of will which his soul
needed for a determined stand, and left him incapable of decisive
action, even in the face of grossest evil. The mordant
reply of Wenceslas only strengthened his conviction of the
futility of massing his own feeble forces against those of one
so thoroughly entrenched as this man, who had the ear of the
Bishop&ndash;&ndash;nay, whose resourceful mind was now said to be actually
directing the policies of the feeble old ecclesiastic who
held the bishopric of Cartagena.</p>
<p>As if groping through the blackness of midnight, he moved
slowly down the deserted nave of the Cathedral and mounted
the winding stairs to the ambulatory above. Pausing at the
door of the <i>sanctum</i> for a moment to gather up his remnant of
moral strength, he entered and stood hesitant before the waiting
Bishop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
</div>
<p>The long War of Independence which destroyed the last vestige of Spanish
control over the Peruvian colonies of South America was virtually brought to a
close by the terrific battle of Ayacucho, fought on the plains between
Pizarro&rsquo;s city of Lima and the ancient Inca seat of Cuzco in the fall of 1824.
The result of this battle had been eagerly awaited in the city of Cartagena,
capital of the newly formed federation of Colombia. It was known there that
the Royalist army was concentrating for a final stand. It was known, too, that
its veterans greatly outnumbered the nondescript band of patriots, many of
whom were provided only with the <i>arma blanca</i>, the indispensable
<i>machete</i> of tropical America. This fact lent a shred of encouragement to
the few proud Tory families still remaining in the city and clinging forlornly
to their broken fortunes, while vainly hoping for a re&euml;stablishment of the
imperial regimen, as they pinned their fate to this last desperate conflict.
Among these, none had been prouder, none more loyal to the Spanish Sovereign,
and none more liberal in dispensing its great wealth to bolster up a hopeless
cause than the ancient and aristocratic family at whose head stood Don Ignacio
Jos&egrave; Marquez de Rinc&oacute;n, distinguished member of the <i>Cabildo</i>, and most
loyal subject of his imperial majesty, King Ferdinand VII. of Spain.</p>
<p>The house of Rinc&oacute;n traced its lineage back to the ferocious
adventurer, Juan de Rinc&oacute;n, favorite lieutenant of the renowned
<i>Conquistador</i>, Pedro de Heredia. When the latter, in the year
1533, obtained from Charles V. the concession of New Andalusia,
the whole territory comprised between the mouths of the
Magdalena and Atrato rivers in what is now the Republic of Colombia,
and undertook the conquest of this enormously rich district,
the fire-eating Juan, whom the chroniclers of that romantic
period quaintly described as &ldquo;causing the same effects
as lightning and quicksilver,&rdquo; was his most dependable support.
Together they landed at the Indian village of Calamari, and,
after putting the pacific inhabitants to the sword&ndash;&ndash;a manner of
disposal most satisfactory to the practical Juan&ndash;&ndash;laid the foundations
of the present city of Cartagena, later destined to become
the &ldquo;Queen of the Indies,&rdquo; the pride, as it was the despair,
of the haughty monarchs of Spain.</p>
<p>For his eminent services in this exploit Juan received a
large tract of land in the most fertile part of the Magdalena
valley&ndash;&ndash;which he immediately staked and lost at the gaming-table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page11' name='book1_page11'></a>11</span>
As a measure of consolation, and doubtless with the view
of checking Juan&rsquo;s gambling propensities, Pedro de Heredia
then bestowed upon him a strip of bleak and unexplored mountain
country adjacent to the river Atrato. Stung by his sense
of loss, as well as by the taunts of his boisterous companions,
and harassed by the practical conclusion that life&rsquo;s brevity
would not permit of wiping out their innumerable insults
singly by the sword, the raging Juan gathered together a few
blood-drinking companions of that ilk and set out to find diversion
of mind on his possessions.</p>
<p>Years passed. One day Juan again appeared on the streets
of Cartagena, and this time with gold enough to buy the city.
The discovery of rich auriferous sands on his estates adjoining
the Atrato, which were worked extensively for him by the
natives whom he and his companions had forced into subjection,
had yielded him enormous wealth. He settled in Cartagena,
determined to make it his future home, and at once set
about buying great blocks of houses and erecting a palace
for himself. He began to acquire lands and mines in all
directions. He erected a sumptuous summer residence in what
is now the suburb of Turbaco. He built an <i>arena</i>, and bred
bulls for it from famous stock which he imported from the
mother-country. He gave <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and public entertainments on
the most lavish scale imaginable. In short, he quickly became
Cartagena&rsquo;s most influential and distinguished citizen, as he
was easily her richest.</p>
<p>But far more important to mention than all these dry
details was the undoubted change of character which had
come over the man himself. Perhaps it was the awful heat
of the steaming Atrato valley that drew the fire from his livid
soul. Perhaps it was a dawning appreciation of the opportunities
made possible by his rapid acquisition of wealth that
had softened his character. Some said he had seen a vision
of the Virgin Mary. Others laid it to a terrible fever, in
which for days he had lain delirious in the shadow of death.
Be that as it may, the bloodthirsty <i>Conquistador</i>, who a few
years before angrily shook the dust of Cartagena from his
feet, had now returned a changed man.</p>
<p>At once Juan began to manifest in an ever increasing
degree an interest in matters religious. In this respect his
former character suffered a complete reversal. He assiduously
cultivated the clergy, and gave large sums for the
support of the Cathedral and the religious orders of the city.
The Bishop became a frequent guest at his sumptuous table;
and as often he in turn sought the Bishop for consultation
anent his benefactions and, in particular, for consolation when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page12' name='book1_page12'></a>12</span>
haunted by sad memories of his devilish exploits in early
life. When the great-hearted Padre Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas,
infirm but still indefatigable in his work for the protection and
uplift of the Indians, arrived one memorable day in his little
canoe which his devoted native servants had paddled through
the <i>dique</i> from the great river beyond, Juan was the first to
greet him and insist that he make his home with him while
in the city. And on the night of the Padre&rsquo;s arrival it is said
that Juan, with tears streaming down his scarred and wrinkled
face, begged to be allowed to confess to him the awful atrocities
which he had committed upon the innocent and harmless
aborigines when, as was his wont, his breath hot with the
lust of blood, he had fallen upon them without provocation
and hewed them limb from limb.</p>
<p>In his old age the now gentle Juan, his former self almost
obliterated, expressed a desire to renounce the world, bestow
his great wealth upon the Church, and enter a monastery to
pass his remaining years. Despite the protestations of his
numerous family, for whom his religious zeal would permit
him to leave but scanty provision, he was already formulating
plans toward this end when death overtook him, and his vast
estates descended intact to the family which he had founded.</p>
<p>So complete had been the transformation of Juan de Rinc&oacute;n
during the many years that he lived after his return to Cartagena
that the characteristics which he transmitted to his
posterity were, in general, quite the reverse of those which he
himself had manifested so abundantly in early life. Whereas,
he had formerly been atrociously cruel, boastingly impious,
and a scoffer at matters religious, his later descendants were
generally tender of heart, soft of manner, and of great piety.
Whereas, in early manhood he had been fiery and impulsive,
quick of decision and immovable of opinion, his progeny were
increasingly inclined to be deliberate in judgment and vacillating
of purpose. So many of his descendants entered the
priesthood that the family was threatened with extinction, for
in the course of time it had become a sacred custom in the
Rinc&oacute;n family to consecrate the first-born son to the Church.
This custom at length became fixed, and was rigidly observed,
even to the point of bigotry, despite the obliteration of those
branches where there was but a single son.</p>
<p>The family, so auspiciously launched, waxed increasingly
rich and influential; and when the smoldering fires of revolution
burst into flame among the oppressed South American
colonies, late in the year 1812, the house of Rinc&oacute;n, under
royal and papal patronage, was found occupying the first
position of eminence and prestige in the proud old city of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page13' name='book1_page13'></a>13</span>
Cartagena. Its wealth had become proverbial. Its sons, educated
by preceptors brought from Paris and Madrid, were
prominent at home and abroad. Its honor was unimpeachable.
Its fair name was one of the most resplendent jewels in
the Spanish crown. And Don Ignacio epitomized loyalty to
Sovereign and Pope.</p>
<p>With the inauguration of hostilities no fears were felt by
the Rinc&oacute;n family for the ultimate success of the royalist
arms, and Don Ignacio immediately despatched word to his
Sovereign in Madrid that the wealth and services of his house
were at the royal disposal. Of this offer Ferdinand quickly
availed himself. The Rinc&oacute;n funds were drawn upon immediately
and without stint to furnish men and muniments for
the long and disastrous struggle. Of the family resources
there was no lack while its members held their vast possessions
of lands and mines. But when, after the first successes of the
patriots, reprisals began to be visited upon the Tories of
Cartagena, and their possessions fell, one after another, into
the hands of the successful revolutionists, or were seized by
former slaves, Don Ignacio found it difficult to meet his royal
master&rsquo;s demands. The fickle King, already childish to the
verge of imbecility, gave scant thanks in return for the Rinc&oacute;n
loyalty, and when at last, stripped of his fortune, deserted by
all but the few Tory families who had the courage to remain
in Cartagena until the close of the war, Don Ignacio received
with sinking heart the news of the battle of Ayacucho, he knew
full well that any future appeal to Ferdinand for recognition
of his great sacrifices would fall upon unhearing ears.</p>
<p>But to remain in republican Cartagena after the final success
of the revolutionists was to the royalist Don Ignacio quite
impossible. Even if permitted the attempt, he was so attached
to the ancient order of things that he could not adjust himself
to the radically changed conditions. So, gathering about him
the sorrowing remnant of his family, and converting into a
pitifully small sum his few remaining possessions, he took
passage on an English trader and sailed for the mother-country,
to begin life anew among those whose speech and
customs were most familiar to him.</p>
<p>He settled in Seville, where the elder of his two sons,
Rafa&eacute;l de Rinc&oacute;n, a lad of fifteen, was studying for the priesthood,
under the patronage of the Archbishop. There he established
himself in the wine business, associating with him his
second son, Carlos, only a year the junior of his brother. But,
broken in spirit as well as in fortune, he made little headway,
and two years later died pitiably in poverty and obscurity.</p>
<p>Through the influence of the Archbishop, the business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page14' name='book1_page14'></a>14</span>
which Carlos was far too young and immature to conduct, was
absorbed by larger interests, and the young lad retained as
an employe. As the years passed the boy developed sufficient
commercial ability to enable him to retain his position and
to extract from it enough to provide for the needs of himself
and his dependents. He married, late in life, a woman whose
family had fled from Cartagena with his own and settled in
Seville. She was but a babe in arms at the time of the exodus,
and many years his junior. A year after the marriage a
child was born to them, a son. The babe&rsquo;s birth was premature,
following a fright which the mother received when attacked
by a beggar. But the child lived. And, according to the
honored family custom, which the father insisted on observing
as rigidly in Spain as it had been formerly in Cartagena, this
son, Jos&egrave; Francisco Enrique de Rinc&oacute;n, was at birth consecrated
to the service of God in the Holy Catholic Church.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
</div>
<p>If, as Thoreau said, &ldquo;God is on the side of the most sensitive,&rdquo;
then He should have been very close to the timid,
irresolute lad in Seville, in whom the softer traits of character,
so unexpectedly developed in the adventurous founder
of the Rinc&oacute;n family, now stood forth so prominently. Somber,
moody, and retiring; delicately sensitive and shrinking; acutely
honest, even to the point of morbidity; deeply religious and
passionately studious, with a consuming zeal for knowledge,
and an unsatisfied yearning for truth, the little Jos&egrave; early in
life presented a strange medley of characteristics, which bespoke
a need of the utmost care and wisdom on the part of
those who should have the directing of his career. Forced
into the world before his time, and strongly marked by his
mother&rsquo;s fear; afflicted with precarious health, and subjected
to long and desperate illnesses in childhood, his little soul
early took on a gloom and asceticism wholly unnatural to
youth. Fear was constantly instilled into his acutely receptive
mind by his solicitous, doting parents; and his life was thereby
stunted, warped, and starved. He was reared under the constant
reminder of the baleful effects of food, of air, of conduct,
of this and that invisible force inimical to health; and terror
and anxiety followed him like a ghost and turned about all
his boyish memories. Under these repressing influences his
mind could not but develop with a lack of stamina for self-support.
Hesitancy and vacillation became pronounced. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page15' name='book1_page15'></a>15</span>
time, the weight of any important decision gave him acute,
unendurable agony of mind. Called upon to decide for himself
a matter of import, his thought would become confused, his
brain torpid, and in tears and perplexity the tormented lad
would throw himself into the arms of his anxious parents
and beg to be told what course to pursue.</p>
<p>Thus his nature grew to depend upon something stronger
than itself to twine about. He sought it in his schoolmates;
but they misread him. The little acts which were due to his
keen sensitiveness or to his exaggerated reticence of disposition
were frequently interpreted by them as affronts, and he was
generally left out of their games, or avoided entirely. His
playmates consequently became fewer and more transient as
the years gained upon him, until at length, trodden upon, but
unable to turn, he withdrew his love from the world and
bestowed it all upon his anxious mother. She became his only
intimate, and from her alone he sought the affection for which
he yearned with an intensity that he could not express. Shunning
the boisterous, frolicking children at the close of the
school day, he would seek her, and, nestling at her side, her
hand clasped in his, would beg her to talk to him of the
things with which his childish thought was struggling. These
were many, but they revolved about a common center&ndash;&ndash;religion.</p>
<p>The salient characteristics already mentioned were associated
with others, equally prominent, and no less influential
in the shaping of his subsequent career. With the development
of his deep, inward earnestness there had appeared
indications of latent powers of mind that were more than
ordinary. These took the form of childish precocity in his
studies, clearness of spiritual vision, and maturity in his conduct
and mode of life. The stunting of his physical nature
threw into greater prominence his exaggerated soul-qualities,
his tenderness, his morbid conscientiousness, and a profound
emotionalism which, at the sight of a great painting, or the
roll of the Cathedral organ, would flood his eyes and fill his
throat with sobs. When the reckless founder of the family
experienced a reversal of his own dark traits of soul, nearly
three centuries before, it was as if the pendulum had swung
too far in the opposite direction, and at the extreme point of
its arc had left the little Jos&egrave;, with the sterner qualities of the
old <i>Conquistador</i> wholly neutralized by self-condemnation,
fear, infirmity of purpose, a high degree of intellectuality, and
a soul-permeating religious fervor.</p>
<p>At the mention of religion the timid lad at once became
passionate, engrossed&ndash;&ndash;nay, obsessed. In his boyhood years,
before the pall of somber reticence had settled over him, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page16' name='book1_page16'></a>16</span>
been impressed with the majesty of the Church and the
gorgeousness of her material fabric. The religious ideals taught
him by his good mother took deep root. But the day arrived
when the expansion of his intellect reached such a point as to
enable him to detect a flaw in her reasoning. It was but a
little rift, yet the sharp edge of doubt slipped in. Alas! from
that hour he ceased to drift with the current of popular theological
belief; his frail bark turned, and launched out upon
the storm-tossed sea, where only the outstretched hand of
the Master, treading the heaving billows through the thick
gloom, saved it at length from destruction.</p>
<p>The hungry lad began to question his parents incessantly
regarding the things of the spirit. His teachers in the parochial
school he plied with queries which they could not meet.
Day after day, while other boys of his tender age romped in
the street, he would steal into the great Cathedral and stand,
pathetically solitary, before the statues of the Christ and the
Virgin Mary, yearning over the problems with which his
childish thought was struggling, and the questions to which
no one could return satisfying replies.</p>
<p>Here again the boy seemed to manifest in exaggerated form
the reversed characteristics of the old <i>Conquistador</i>. But,
unlike that of the pious Juan, the mind of the little Jos&egrave; was
not so simple as to permit it to accept without remonstrance
the tenets of his family&rsquo;s faith. Blind acceptance of any teaching,
religious or secular, early became quite impossible to him.
This entailed many an hour of suffering to the lad, and brought
down upon his little head severe punishments from his preceptors
and parents. But in vain they admonished and threatened.
The child demanded proofs; and if proofs were not at
hand, his acceptance of the mooted teaching was but tentative,
generally only an outward yielding to his beloved mother&rsquo;s
inexorable insistence. Many the test papers he returned to his
teachers whereon he had written in answer to the questions
set, &ldquo;I am taught to reply thus; but in my heart I do not believe
it.&rdquo; Vainly the teachers appealed to his parents. Futilely the
latter pleaded and punished. The placid receptiveness of the
Rinc&oacute;n mind, which for more than three hundred years had
normally performed its absorptive functions and imbibed the
doctrines of its accepted and established human authorities,
without a trace of the heresy of suspecting their genuineness,
had at last experienced a reversal. True, the boy had been
born in the early hours of nineteenth century doubt and religious
skepticism. The so-called scientific spirit, buried for
ages beneath the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of human conjecture, was painfully
emerging and preening its wings for flight. The &ldquo;higher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page17' name='book1_page17'></a>17</span>
criticism&rdquo; was nascent, and ancient traditions were already
beginning to totter on the foundations which the Fathers had
set. But Spain, close wrapped in mediaeval dreams, had suffered
no taint of &ldquo;modernism.&rdquo; The portals of her mind were
well guarded against the entrance of radical thought, and her
dreamers were yet lulled into lethargic adherence to outworn
beliefs and musty creeds by the mesmerism of priestly tradition.
The peculiar cast of mind of the boy Jos&egrave; was not the
product of influences from without, but was rather an exemplification
of the human mind&rsquo;s reversion to type, wherein the
narrow and bigoted mentality of many generations had expanded
once more into the breadth of scope and untrammeled
freedom of an ancient progenitor.</p>
<p>As the boy grew older his ability to absorb learning increased
astonishingly. His power of analysis, his keen perception
and retentive memory soon advanced him beyond the
youths of his own age, and forced him to seek outside the
pale of the schoolroom for the means to satisfy his hunger
for knowledge. He early began to haunt the bookstalls of
Seville, and day after day would stand for hours searching the
treasures which he found there, and mulling over books which
all too frequently were <i>anathema</i> to the orthodox. Often the
owner of one of these shops, who knew the lad&rsquo;s parents, and
whose interest had been stirred by his passion for reading,
would let him take one or more of the coveted volumes home
over night, for the slender family purse would not permit him
to purchase what his heart craved. Then came feasts for his
famished little soul which often lasted until daybreak.</p>
<p>It happened one evening that, when he crept off to his little
room to peer into one of these borrowed treasures, his father
followed him. Pushing the chamber door softly open the
parent found the boy propped against his pillow in bed, absorbed
in a much-thumbed volume which he was reading by
the pale light of the single candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it thus that you deceive your poor parents?&rdquo; the fond
father began, in a tone of mock severity.</p>
<p>The startled lad stifled a cry and hastily thrust the book
beneath his pillow. The father&rsquo;s interest now became genuine.
Leaning over the terrified boy he drew forth the volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Voltaire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doting father stood petrified. Voltaire, <i>Antichrist</i>,
Archfiend of impiety&ndash;&ndash;and in the hands of his beloved son!</p>
<p>Sleep fled the little household that night. In his father&rsquo;s
arms, while the distressed mother hung over them, the boy
sobbed out his confession. He had not intended to deceive.
He had picked up this book in the stall without knowing its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page18' name='book1_page18'></a>18</span>
nature. He had become so interested in what it said about
the Virgin Mary that he forgot all else. The shopkeeper had
found him reading it, and had laughed and winked at his clerk
when he bade the boy take it home for the night. The book
had fascinated him. He himself&ndash;&ndash;did not his father know?&ndash;&ndash;had
so often asked how the Virgin could be the mother of God,
and why men prayed to her. Yes, he knew it mocked their
faith&ndash;&ndash;and the sacred Scriptures. He knew, too, that his father
would not approve of it. That was why he had tried to hide it
beneath his pillow. He had been wicked, desperately wicked,
to deceive his dear parents&ndash;&ndash;But the book&ndash;&ndash;It made him forget&ndash;&ndash;It
said so many things that seemed to be true&ndash;&ndash;And&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>padre m&iacute;o</i>, forgive me, forgive me! I want to know
the truth about God and the world!&rdquo; The delicate frame of the
young lad shook in paroxysms of grief.</p>
<p>Alas! it was but the anguished soul-cry which has echoed
through the halls of space since time began. What a mockery
to meet it with empty creed and human dogma! Alas! what a
crime against innocence to stifle the honest questionings of a
budding mind with the musty cloak of undemonstrable beliefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my son, have I not often told you? The Holy Church
gives us the truth,&rdquo; replied the father, frightened by the storm
which raged within the childish soul, yet more alarmed at
the turn which the mind of his cherished son was apparently
taking&ndash;&ndash;his only son, dedicated to the service of God from the
cradle, and in whom the shattered hopes of this once proud
family were now centered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this book laughs at us because we pray to a woman!&rdquo;
sobbed the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. But does not its author need the prayers of so pure
a woman as the Virgin? Do we not all need them? And is
it not likely that one so good as she would have great influence
with God&ndash;&ndash;much greater than we ourselves, or even the best
of men, could have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can she be the mother of God? The Bible does
not teach that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that the Bible does not teach it, my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;have read&ndash;&ndash;the Bible,&rdquo; faltered the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read the Bible!&rdquo; cried the astonished father.
&ldquo;And where have you done that, you wicked boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the bookstore of Mariano,&rdquo; confessed the trembling
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i>&rdquo; burst from the father, as he started to
his feet. &ldquo;Mariano is a wicked infidel! The Bishop shall hear
of this! Ah, well may the Holy Father in Rome grieve to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page19' name='book1_page19'></a>19</span>
his innocent babes led astray by these servants of hell! But,
my son,&rdquo; returning to the boy and clasping him again in his
arms, &ldquo;it is not too late. The Virgin Mother has protected
you. You meant no harm. Satan covets your pure little soul&ndash;&ndash;But
he shall not have it!&rdquo; The father&rsquo;s tremulous voice
mounted high, &ldquo;No, by the Saints in heaven, he shall not
have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s assurance slowly returned under the influence
of his father&rsquo;s tender solicitude, even though he remained
dimly conscious of the rift widening little by little between his
parents&rsquo; settled convictions and his own groping thought.
With the assuaging of his grief came again those insistent
questions which throughout his life had tormented his peace
and driven him even to the doors of infidels in search of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he began timidly, &ldquo;why was I wicked to read
the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my son, in doing so you yielded to the temptations
of Satan. The Bible is a great and mysterious book,
written by God himself. He meant it to be explained to us by
the Holy Father, who is the head of the Church which the good
Saint Peter founded. We are not great enough nor good
enough to understand it. The Holy Father, who cares for
God&rsquo;s Church on earth, he is good enough, and he alone can
interpret it to us. Satan tries to do with all men just what he
did with you, my child. He seeks to make them read the Bible
so that he can confuse them and rob them of their faith.
Then when he gets possession of their souls he drags them
down with him to hell, where they are lost forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does the Holy Father really believe that Mary is the
mother of God?&rdquo; persisted the boy, raising his tear-stained
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;is she not? The blessed Saviour said that he and
God were one. And, as Mary is the mother of Christ, she is
also the mother of God&ndash;&ndash;is she not? Let us read what the
good Saint John Chrysostom says.&rdquo; He rose and went into
another room, returning in a few minutes with a little volume.
Taking the boy again on his knee, he continued, &ldquo;The blessed
Saint tells us that the Virgin Mary was made the mother of
God in order that she might obtain salvation for many who,
on account of their wicked lives, could not be saved, because
they had so offended divine justice, but yet, by the help of
her sweet mercy and mighty intercession, might be cleansed
and rendered fit for heaven. My little son, you have always
been taught that Mary is heaven&rsquo;s Queen. And so she is ours,
and reigns in heaven for us. Jesus loves to have her close to
him, and he can never refuse her requests. He always grants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page20' name='book1_page20'></a>20</span>
what she asks. And that is the reason why we pray to her.
She never forgets us&ndash;&ndash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A troubled look crossed the boy&rsquo;s face. Then he began
anew. &ldquo;Father dear, God made everything, did He not? The
Bible says that, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did He make Satan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father hesitated. The child hurried on under the lash
of his holy inquisitiveness. &ldquo;Father, how did evil come into
the world? Is God both good and bad? And how can a good
God punish us forever for sins committed here in only a few
short years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>queridito</i>!&rdquo; cried the harassed father. &ldquo;Such questions
should not have entered your little head for years to
come! Why can you not run and play as do other children?
Why are you not happy as they are? Why must you spend
your days thinking of things that are far too deep for you?
Can you not wait? Some day you shall know all. Some day,
when you have entered the service of God, perhaps you may
even learn these things from the Holy Father himself. Then
you will understand how the good God lets evil tempt us in
order that our faith in Him may be exercised and grow
strong&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He lets Satan harm us purposely?&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s innocent
dark eyes looked up appealingly into his father&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only for a short time, little son. And only those who
are never fit for heaven go down with Satan. But you are not
one of those,&rdquo; he hastily added, straining the boy to him.
&ldquo;And the Masses which the good priests say for us will lift us
out of purgatory and into heaven, where the streets are pure
gold and the gates are pearl. And there we will all live together
for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; interrupted the boy, &ldquo;I have thought of these
things for a long, long time. I do not believe them. And I do
not wish to become a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father fell silent. It was one of those tense moments
which every man experiences when he sees a withering frost
slowly gathering over the fondest hopes of a lifetime. The
family of Rinc&oacute;n, aristocratic, intensely loyal to Church and
State, had willingly laid itself upon the sacrificial altar in deference
to its honored traditions. Custom had become law. Obedience
of son to parent and parent to Sovereign, spiritual or
temporal, had been the guiding star of the family&rsquo;s destinies.
To think was lawful; but to hold opinions at variance with
tradition was unspeakable heresy. Spontaneity of action was
commendable; but conduct not prescribed by King or Pope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page21' name='book1_page21'></a>21</span>
was unpardonable crime. Loss of fortune, of worldly power
and prestige, were as nothing; deviation from the narrow path
trodden by the illustrious scions of the great Juan was everything.
That this lad, to whom had descended the undying
memories of a long line of glorious defenders of kingly and
papal power, should presume to shatter the sacred Rinc&oacute;n
traditions, was unbelievable. It was none other than the work
of Satan. The boy had fallen an innocent victim to the devil&rsquo;s
wiles.</p>
<p>But the house of Rinc&oacute;n had withstood the assaults of the
son of perdition for more than three centuries. It would not
yield now! The all-powerful Church of Rome stood behind it&ndash;&ndash;and
the gates of hell could not prevail against her! The
Church would save her own. Yes, the father silently argued,
through his brother&rsquo;s influence the case should be laid before
His Eminence, the Archbishop. And, if need be, the Holy
Father himself should be called upon to cast the devil out of
this tormented child. To argue with the boy now were futile,
even dangerous. The lad had grown up with full knowledge
of his parents&rsquo; fond hopes for his future. He had never openly
opposed them, although at times the worried mother would
voice her fears to the father when her little son brought his
perplexing questions to her and failed to find satisfaction.
But until this night the father had felt no alarm. Indeed, he
had looked upon the child&rsquo;s inquisitiveness as but a logical
consequence of his precocity and unusual mental powers, in
which he himself felt a father&rsquo;s swelling pride. To his thought
it augured rapid promotion in the Church; it meant in time
a Cardinal&rsquo;s hat. Ah, what glorious possibilities! How the
prestige of the now sunken family would soar! Happily he
had been aroused to an appreciation of the boy&rsquo;s really desperate
state in time. The case should go before the Archbishop
to-morrow, and the Church should hear his call to
hasten to the rescue of this wandering lamb.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
</div>
<p>Seville is called the heart of Spain. In a deeper sense it
is her soul. Within it, extremes touch, but only to blend
into a harmonious unit which manifests the Spanish
temperament and character more truly there than in any other
part of the world. In its Andalusian atmosphere the religious
instinct of the Spaniard reaches its fullest embodiment. True,
its bull-fights are gory spectacles; but they are also gorgeous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page22' name='book1_page22'></a>22</span>
and solemn ceremonies. Its <i>ferias</i> are tremendously worldly;
but they are none the less stupendous religious <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>. Its
picturesque Easter processions, when colossal images of the
Virgin are carried among bareheaded and kneeling crowds,
smack of paganism; but we cannot question the genuineness of
the religious fervor thus displayed. Its Cathedral touches the
<i>arena</i>; and its Archbishop washes the feet of its old men. Its
religion is still the living force which unites and levels, exalts
and debases. And its religion is Rome.</p>
<p>On the fragrant spring morning following the discovery of
the execrated Voltaire, the little Jos&egrave;, tightly clutching his
father&rsquo;s hand, threaded the narrow Sierpes and crossed the
Prado de San Sebastian, once the <i>Quemador</i>, where the Holy
Inquisition was wont to purge heresy from human souls with
fire. The father shuddered, and his stern face grew dark, as
he thought of the revolting scenes once enacted in that place
in the name of Christ; and he inwardly voiced a prayer of
gratitude that the Holy Office had ceased to exist. Yet he knew
that, had he lived in that day, he would have handed his beloved
son over to that awful institution without demurral, rather
than see him develop those heretical views which were already
rising from the soil of his fertile, inquisitive mind.</p>
<p>The tinkling of a bell sounded down the street. Father and
son quickly doffed their hats and knelt on the pavement, while
a priest, mounted on a mule, rode swiftly past on his way to
the bedside of a dying communicant, the flickering lights and
jingling bell announcing the fact that he bore with him the
Sacred Host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God, you will do the same some day, my son,&rdquo;
murmured the father. But the little Jos&egrave; kept his eyes to the
pavement, and would make no reply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at a splendidly carved table in the library of
his palatial residence, surrounded by every luxury that wealth
and ecclesiastical influence could command, the Archbishop,
pious shepherd of a restless flock, sat with clouded brow and
heavy heart. The festive ceremonials of Easter were at hand,
and the Church was again preparing to display her chief
splendors. But on the preceding Easter disturbances had interrupted
the processions of the Virgin; and already rumors had
reached the ears of the Archbishop of further trouble to be
incited during the approaching Holy Week by the growing body
of skeptics and anticlericals. To what extent these liberals
had assumed the proportions of a propaganda, and how active
they would now show themselves, were questions causing the
holy man deep concern. Heavy sighs escaped him as he voiced
his fears to his sympathetic secretary and associate, Rafa&eacute;l de
Rinc&oacute;n, the gaunt, ascetic uncle of the little Jos&egrave;.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page23' name='book1_page23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he murmured gloomily. &ldquo;Since the day that our
Isabella yielded to her heretic ministers and thrust aside the
good Sister Patrocinio, Spain has been in a perilous state. After
that unholy act the dethronement and exile of the Queen were
inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Your Eminence,&rdquo; replied the secretary. &ldquo;But is
there no cause for hope in the elevation of her son, Alfonso, to
the throne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is but seventeen&ndash;&ndash;and absent from Spain six years. He
lacks the force of his talented mother. And there is no longer
a Sister Patrocinio to command the royal ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunate, I admit, Your Eminence. She bore the
<i>stigmata</i>, the very marks of our Saviour&rsquo;s wounds, imprinted
on her flesh, and worked his miracles. But, in Alfonso&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted the Archbishop impatiently; &ldquo;he has
styled himself the first Republican in Europe. He will make
Catholicism the state religion; but he will extend religious toleration
to all. He is consumptive in mind as well as in body.
And the army&ndash;&ndash;alas! what may we look for from it when
soldiers like this Polo Hernandez refuse to kneel during the
Mass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man has been arrested, Your Eminence,&rdquo; the secretary
offered in consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the court-martial acquitted him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. Yet he has now been summoned before the supreme
court in Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop&rsquo;s face brightened somewhat. &ldquo;And the
result&ndash;&ndash;what think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary shrugged his drooping shoulders. &ldquo;They will
condemn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, doubtless he would be condemned, for mediaevalism
dies hard in Spain. But the incident was portentous, and the
Archbishop and his keen secretary heard in it an ominous echo.</p>
<p>A servant appeared at the heavy portieres, and at a sign
from the secretary ushered Jos&egrave; and his father into the august
presence awaiting them.</p>
<p>An hour later the pair emerged from the palace and started
homeward. His Eminence, rousing himself from the profound
revery in which he had been sunk for some moments, turned
to his expectant secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Luther in embryo!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared as much, Your Eminence,&rdquo; returned the austere
secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, a remarkable intellect! Astonishing mental
power! But all tainted with the damnable so-called scientific
spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page24' name='book1_page24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;True, Your Eminence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But marked you not his deep reverence for God? And his
sturdy honesty? And how, despite his embarrassment, the
religious zeal of his soul shown forth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is morbidly honest, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trait I wish we might employ to our own advantage,&rdquo;
mused the churchman. Then, continuing, &ldquo;He is learned far
beyond his years. Indeed, his questions put me to some stress&ndash;&ndash;but
only for the difficulty of framing replies intelligible to a
mind so immature,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;Either he feared my
presence, or he is naturally shrinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so by nature, Your Eminence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop reflected. &ldquo;Na&iuml;ve&ndash;&ndash;pure&ndash;&ndash;simple&ndash;&ndash;mature,
yet childish. Have we covered the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fully, Your Eminence. We omitted to mention his
absorbing filial devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. And that, you tell me, is most pronounced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his strongest characteristic, Your Eminence. He has
no will to oppose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that his devotion were for Holy Church!&rdquo; sighed
the Archbishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may be so directed, Your Eminence,&rdquo; quickly
returned the secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;would he ever consent to enter the priesthood? And
once in, would he not prove a most dangerous element?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary made a deprecating gesture. &ldquo;If I may suggest,
such a man as he promises to become is far more dangerous
outside of the Church than within, Your Eminence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop studied the man&rsquo;s face for a few moments.
&ldquo;There is truth in your words, my friend. Yet how, think you,
may he be secured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Eminence,&rdquo; replied the secretary warmly, &ldquo;pardon
these suggestions in matters where you are far better fitted to
pass sound judgment than a humble servant of the Church like
myself. But in this case intimacy with my brother&rsquo;s family
affords me data which may be serviceable in bringing this
matter to a conclusion. If I may be permitted&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop nodded an unctuous and patronizing appreciation
of his elderly secretary&rsquo;s position, and the latter continued&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Eminence, Holy Week is approaching, and we are
beset with fears lest the spirit of heresy which, alas! is abroad
in our fair city, shall manifest itself in such disturbances as
may force us to abandon these religious exercises in future. I
need not point out the serious nature of these demonstrations.
Nor need I suggest that their relative unimportance last year
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page25' name='book1_page25'></a>25</span>
was due solely to lack of strong leadership. Already our soldiers
begin to refuse to kneel during the Mass. The Holy
Church is not yet called upon to display her weapons. But
who shall say to what measures she may not be forced when an
able and fearless leader shall arise among the heretics? To-day
there has stood before Your Eminence a lad possessing,
in my opinion, the latent qualifications for such leadership.
I say, latent. I use the term advisedly, for I know that he
appears to manifest the Rinc&oacute;n lack of decision. But so did I
at his age. And who can say when the unfolding of his other
powers, now so markedly indicated, may not force the development
of those certain traits of character in which he now
seems deficient, but which, developed, would make him a
power in the world? Shall the Church permit this promising
lad to stray from her, possibly later to join issue with her
enemies and use his great gifts to propagate heresy and assault
her foundations? Are we faithful to our beloved Mother if we
do not employ every means, foul or fair, to destroy her enemies,
even in the cradle? Remember, &lsquo;He who gains the youth,
possesses the future,&rsquo; as the saying goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loyally spoken, faithful son,&rdquo; replied the Archbishop,
shifting into a more comfortable position. &ldquo;And you suggest&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This: that we wisely avail ourselves of his salient characteristics&ndash;&ndash;his
weaknesses, if you wish&ndash;&ndash;and secure him now
to the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, more specifically&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; with increasing animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Eminence is already aware of the custom in our
family of consecrating the first-born son to the service of God.
This boy has been so consecrated from birth. It is the dearest
hope of his parents. At present their wishes are still his law.
Their judgments yet formulate his conduct. His sense of honor
is acute. Your Eminence can see that his word is sacred.
His oath once taken would bind him eternally. <i>It is for us to
secure that oath!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo; The Archbishop leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, co&ouml;perating with his parents, will cater to his consuming
passion for learning, and offer him the education which
the limited resources of his family cannot provide. We save
him from the drudgery of commercialism, and open to him the
life of the scholar. We suggest to him a career consecrated
to study and holy service. The Church educates him&ndash;&ndash;he
serves his fellow-men through her. Once ordained, his character
is such, I believe, that he could never become an apostate.
And, whatever his services to Holy Church may be thereafter,
she at least will have effectually disposed of a possible opponent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page26' name='book1_page26'></a>26</span>
She has all to gain, and nothing to lose by such procedure.
Unless I greatly mistake the Rinc&oacute;n character, the lad
will yield to our inducements and his mother&rsquo;s prayers, the
charm of the Church and the bias of her tutelage, and ultimately
take the oath of ordination. After that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faithful adviser,&rdquo; interrupted the Archbishop genially,
as visions of the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat for eminent services hovered
before him, &ldquo;write immediately to Monsignor, Rector of the
<i>Seminario</i>, in Rome. Say that he must at once receive, at our
expense and on our recommendation, a lad of twelve, who
greatly desires to be trained for the priesthood.&rdquo;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_5' id='CHAPTER_5'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
</div>
<p>Thus did the Church open her arms to receive her wandering
child. Thus did her infallible wisdom, as expressed
through her zealous agents in Seville, essay to solve the
perplexing problems of this agitated little mind, and whisper
to its confused throbbing, &ldquo;Peace, be still.&rdquo; The final disposition
came to the boy not without some measure of relief, despite,
his protest. The long days of argument and pleading, of assurance
that within the Church he should find abundant and
satisfactory answers to his questions, and of explanations which
he was adjured to receive on faith until such time as he might
be able to prove their soundness, had utterly exhausted his
sensitive little soul, and left him without the combative energy
or will for further remonstrance.</p>
<p>Nor was the conflict solely a matching of his convictions
against the desires of his parents and the persuasions of the
Archbishop and his loyal secretary. The boy&rsquo;s hunger for
learning alone might have caused him to yield to the lure of a
broad education. Moreover, his nature contained not one element
of commercialism. The impossibility of entering the wine
business with his father, or of spending his life in physical
toil for a bare maintenance, was as patent to himself, even at
that early age, as to his parents. His bent was wholly intellectual.
But he knew that his father could not afford him an
education. Yet this the Church now offered freely. Again,
his nature was essentially religious. The Church now extended
all her learning, all her vast resources, all her spiritual
power, to develop and foster this instinct. Nay, more, to protect
and guide its development into right channels.</p>
<p>The fact, too, that the little Jos&egrave; was a child of extreme
emotions must not be overlooked in an estimate of the influences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page27' name='book1_page27'></a>27</span>
which bore upon him during these trying days. His
devotion to an object upon which he had set his affections
amounted to obsession. He adored his parents&ndash;&ndash;reverenced his
father&ndash;&ndash;worshiped his mother. The latter he was wont to
compare to the flowers, to the bright-plumed birds, to the
butterflies that hovered in the sunlight of their little <i>patio</i>. He
indited childish poems to her, and likened her in purity and
beauty to the angels and the Virgin Mary. Her slightest wish
was his inflexible law. Not that he was never guilty of childish
faults of conduct, of little whims of stubbornness and petulance;
but his character rested on a foundation of honesty,
sincerity, and filial love that was never shaken by the summer
storms of naughtiness which at times made their little disturbances
above.</p>
<p>The parents breathed a sigh of relief when the tired child
at last bowed to their wishes and accepted the destiny thrust
upon him. The coming of a son to these loyal royalists and
zealous Catholics had meant the imposition of a sacred trust.
That he was called to high service in the Church of God was
evidenced by Satan&rsquo;s early and malicious attacks upon him.
There was but one course for them to pursue, and they did not
for a moment question its soundness. To their thought, this
precocious child lacked the wisdom and balance which comes
only with years. The infallible Church, their all-wise spiritual
guide, supported their contentions. What they did was for
her and for the eternal welfare of the boy. Likewise, for the
maintenance of family pride and honor in a generation tainted
with liberalism and distrust of the sacred traditions.</p>
<p>The Church, on the other hand, in the august person of the
Archbishop, had accomplished a triumph. She had recognized
the child&rsquo;s unusual gifts of mind, and had been alert to the
dangers they threatened. If secured to herself, and their development
carefully directed, they would mold him into her
future champion. If, despite her careful weeding and pruning,
they expanded beyond the limits which she set, <i>they should be
stifled</i>! The peculiar and complex nature of the child offered
her a tremendous advantage. For, if reactionary, his own
highly developed sense of honor, together with his filial devotion
and his intense family pride, should of themselves be
forced to choke all activity in the direction of apostasy and
liberalism. Heaven knew, the Church could not afford to
neglect any action which promised to secure for her a loyal
son; or, failing that, at least effectually check in its incipiency
the development of a threatened opponent! Truly, as the
astute secretary had said, this boy might prove troublesome
within the fold; but he might also prove more dangerous without.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page28' name='book1_page28'></a>28</span>
Verily, it was a triumph for the cause of righteousness!
And after the final disposition, the good Archbishop had sat
far into the night in the comfort of his <i>sanctum</i>, drowsing
over his pleasant meditations on the rewards which his unflagging
devotion to the cause of Holy Church was sure some
day to bring.</p>
<p>Time sped. The fragrant Sevillian spring melted into summer,
and summer merged with fall. The Rinc&oacute;n family was
adjusting itself to the turn in the career of its heir, the guardian
and depository of its revived hopes. During the weeks
which intervened between his first interview with the Archbishop
and his final departure for Rome, Jos&egrave; had been carefully
prepared by his uncle, who spared no effort to stimulate in the
boy a proper appreciation of his high calling. He was taught
that as a priest of the Holy Catholic Church he would become
a representative of the blessed Christ among men. His mission
would be to carry on the Saviour&rsquo;s work for the salvation of
souls, and, with the power of Christ and in His name, to instruct
mankind in true beliefs and righteous conduct. He
would forgive sins, impose penalties, and offer sacrificial atonement
in the body of the Saviour&ndash;&ndash;in a word, he was to become
<i>sacerdos alter Christus</i>, another Christ. His training for this
exalted work would cover a period of six or eight years, perhaps
longer, and would fit him to become a power among men,
a conserver of the sacred faith, and an ensample of the highest
morality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>sobrinito</i>,&rdquo; the sharp-visaged, gray-haired uncle had
said, &ldquo;truly a fortunate boy are you to hear this grandest of
opportunities knocking at your door! A priest&ndash;&ndash;a God! Nay,
even more than God, for as priest God gives you power over
Himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s wondering eyes widened, and a look of mingled
confusion and astonishment came into his wan face. &ldquo;I do
not see, <i>t&iacute;o m&iacute;o</i>&ndash;&ndash;I do not see,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shall, you shall! And you shall understand the
awful responsibility which God thus reposes upon you, when
He gives you power to do greater things than He did when He
created the world. You shall command the Christ, and He
shall come down at your bidding. Ah, <i>chiquito</i>, a fortunate
boy!&rdquo; But the lad turned wearily away, without sharing his
uncle&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The day before his departure Jos&egrave; was again conducted before
the Archbishop, and after listening to a lengthy r&eacute;sum&eacute;
of what the Church was about to do for him, and what she
expected in return, two solemn vows were exacted from him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; announced the uncle, in low, deliberate tones, &ldquo;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page29' name='book1_page29'></a>29</span>
will solemnly promise your mother and your God that, daily
praying to be delivered from the baneful influences which now
cause doubt and questioning in your mind, and refraining from
voicing them to your teachers or fellow-students, you will strive
to accept all that is taught you in Rome, deferring every endeavor
to prove the teachings you are to receive until the end
of your long course, when, by training and discipline, you
shall have so developed in goodness, purity, and power, that
you shall be found worthy to receive spiritual confirmation of
the great tenets upon which the Holy Roman Catholic Church
has been founded and reared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment to catch his breath and let his
portentous words sink into the quivering brain of the lad before
him. Then he resumed&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, keeping ever in mind your debt of gratitude to the
Church, you promise faithfully to finish your course, and at
the end offer yourself to the service of God in the holy priesthood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solemn hush that lay over the room when he finished
was broken only by the muffled sobs of the mother.</p>
<p>Tender in years, plunged into grief at the impending separation
from home and all that he held dear, the boy knelt before
the secretary and gave his trembling word to observe these
obligations. Then, after he had kissed the Bible and the Archbishop&rsquo;s
extended hand, he threw himself upon the floor in a
torrent of tears.</p>
<p>On the following morning, a bright, sparkling November
day, the little Jos&egrave;, spent with emotion, tore himself from his
mother&rsquo;s clinging embrace and set out for Rome, accompanied
by his solicitous uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, <i>queridito</i>,&rdquo; were the mother&rsquo;s last words, &ldquo;I have
your promise that never will you voluntarily leave the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appeal which his beseeching look carried back to her
was not granted. He slowly bowed his acquiescence, and
turned away. A week later he had entered upon the retreat
with which the school year opens in the <i>Seminario</i>.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_6' id='CHAPTER_6'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>
</div>
<p>Rome, like a fallen gladiator, spent and prostrate on the
Alban hills, still awaits the issue of the conflict between
the forces of life and death within. Dead, where the
blight of pagan and mediaeval superstition has eaten into the
quivering tissues; it lives where the pulsing current of modernism
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page30' name='book1_page30'></a>30</span>
expands its shrunken arteries and bears the nourishing
truth. Though eternal in tradition and colossal in material
achievement, the glory of the Imperial City nevertheless rests
on a foundation of perishable human ambitions, creeds, and
beliefs, manifested outwardly for a time in brilliant deeds, great
edifices, and comprehensive codes, but always bearing within
themselves the seeds of their own decay. No trophy brought
to her gates in triumph by the Caesars ever approached in
worth the simple truth with which Paul of Tarsus, chained to
his jailer, illumined his gloomy dungeon. Had the religious
principles which he and his devoted associates labored so unselfishly
to impart to a benighted world for its own good been
recognized by Rome as the &ldquo;pearl without price,&rdquo; she would
have built upon them as foundation stones a truer glory, and
one which would have drawn the nations of the earth to
worship within her walls. But Rome, in her master, Constantine,
saw only the lure of a temporal advantage to be gained
by fettering the totally misunderstood teachings of Jesus with
the shackles of organized politics. From this unhallowed
marriage of religion and statecraft was born that institution
unlike either parent, yet exhibiting modified characteristics of
each, the Holy Church. To this institution, now mighty in
material riches and power, but still mediaeval in character,
despite the assaults of centuries of progress, a combination of
political maneuver, bigotry, and weakness committed the young
Jos&egrave;, tender, sensitive, receptive, and pure, to be trained as an
agent to further its world-embracing policies.</p>
<p>The retreat upon which the boy at once entered on his
arrival at the seminary extended over ten days. During this
time there were periods of solitary meditation&ndash;&ndash;hours when
his lonely heart cried out in anguish for his beloved mother&ndash;&ndash;visits
to the blessed sacrament, recitations of the office, and
consultations with his spiritual advisers, at which times his
promises to his parents and the Archbishop, coupled with his
natural reticence and the embarrassment occasioned by his
strange environment, sealed his lips and prevented the voicing
of his honest questions and doubts. It was sought through
this retreat to so bring the lad under the influence of the great
religious teachings as to most deeply impress his heart and
mind with the importance of the seminary training upon which
he had entered. His day began with the dreaded meditation at
five in the morning, followed by hearing the Mass and receiving
Communion. It closed, after study and class work, with another
visit to the blessed sacrament, recital of the Rosary,
spiritual reading, and prayer. On Sundays he assisted at
solemn High Mass in the church of the <i>Seminario Pio</i>. One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page31' name='book1_page31'></a>31</span>
day a week was a holiday; but only in the sense that it was
devoted to visiting hospitals and charitable institutions, in
order to acquire practical experience and a foretaste of his
future work among the sick and needy. Clad in his little violet
cassock, low-crowned, three-cornered hat, and <i>soprana</i>, he
might be seen on these holidays trotting along with his fellow-students
in the wake of their superior, his brow generally contracted,
and his childish face seldom lighted by a happy smile.</p>
<p>The first year passed without special incident. The boy,
filled with that quenchless ambition to know, which characterizes
the finest minds, entered eagerly upon his studies and
faithfully observed his promises. If his tender soul warped
and his fresh, receptive mind shriveled under the religious
tutelage he received, no one but himself knew it, not even his
fond mother, as she clasped him again in her arms when he
returned home for the first summer vacation. With the second
year there began studies of absorbing interest to the boy, and
the youthful mind fed hungrily. This seemed to have the effect
of expanding somewhat his self-contained little soul. He appeared
to grow out of himself to a certain extent, to become
less timid, less reticent, even more sociable; and when he
returned to Seville again at the close of the year he had apparently
lost much of the somberness of disposition which had
previously characterized him. The Archbishop examined him
closely; but the boy, speaking little, gave no hint of the inner
working of his thought; and if his soul seethed and fermented
within, the Rinc&oacute;n pride and honor covered it with a placid
demeanor and a bearing of outward calm. When the interview
ended and the lad had departed, the Archbishop descended to
the indignity of roundly slapping his ascetic secretary on his
emaciated back, as an indication of triumphant joy. The boy
certainly was being charmed into deep devotion to the Church!
He was fast being bound to her altars! Again the glorious
spectacle of the Church triumphant in molding a wavering
youth into a devoted son!</p>
<p>Four years passed thus, almost in silence on the boy&rsquo;s part.
Yet his character suffered little change. At home he strove
to avoid all mention of the career upon which he was entering,
although he gave slight indication of dissatisfaction with it.
He was punctilious in his attendance upon religious services;
but to have been otherwise would have brought sorrow to his
proud, happy parents. His days were spent in complete absorption
in his books, or in writing in his journal. The latter
he had begun shortly before entering the seminary, and it was
destined to exert a profound influence upon his life. Often
his parents would playfully urge him to read to them from it;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page32' name='book1_page32'></a>32</span>
but the boy, devotedly obedient and filial in every other respect
steadfastly begged permission to refuse these requests. In that
little whim the fond parents humored him, and he was left
largely alone to his books and his meditations.</p>
<p>During Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s fourth summer vacation a heavy sorrow suddenly
fell upon him and plunged him into such an excess of
grief that it was feared his mind would give way. His revered
father, advanced in years, and weakened by overwork and
business worries, succumbed to the malaria so prevalent in
Seville during the hot months and passed away, after a brief
illness. The blow descended with terrific force upon the morbidly
disposed lad. It was his first intimate experience with
death. For days after the solemn events of the mourning and
funeral he sat as one stunned, holding his mother&rsquo;s hand and
staring dumbly into space; or for hours paced to and fro in
the little <i>patio</i>, his face rigidly set and his eyes fixed vacantly
on the ground beneath. The work of four years in opening
his mind, in expanding his thought, in drawing him out of his
habitual reticence and developing within him the sense of
companionship and easy tolerance, was at one stroke rendered
null. Brought face to face with the grim destroyer, all the
doubt and confusion of former years broke the bounds which
had held them in abeyance and returned upon him with increased
insistence. Never before had he felt so keenly the
impotence of mortal man and the futility of worldly strivings.
Never had he seen so clearly the fatal defects in the accepted
interpretation of Christ&rsquo;s mission on earth. His earlier questionings
returned in violent protests against the emptiness of
the beliefs and formalities of the Church. In times past he
had voiced vague and dimly outlined perceptions of her spiritual
needs. But now to him these needs had suddenly taken
definite form. Jesus had healed the sick of all manner of
disease. He himself was being trained to represent the Christ
on earth. Would he, too, be taught to heal the sick as the
Master had done? The blessed Saviour said, &ldquo;The works that
I do, ye shall do also.&rdquo; But the priests, his representatives,
clearly were not doing the works of the Master. And if he
himself had been an ordained priest at the time of his father&rsquo;s
death, could he have saved him? No, he well knew that he
could not. And yet he would have been the Saviour&rsquo;s representative
among men. Alas! how poor a one he well knew.</p>
<p>In his stress of mind he sought his uncle, and by him was
again led before the Archbishop. His reticence and timidity
dispersed by his great sorrow, the distraught boy faced the high
ecclesiastic with questions terribly blunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my Father, after four years in the <i>Seminario</i>, am I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page33' name='book1_page33'></a>33</span>
not being taught to do the works which our blessed Saviour
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The placid Archbishop stared at the boy in dumb astonishment.
Again, after years of peace that had promised quiescence
on these mooted points! Well, he must buckle on his armor&ndash;&ndash;if
indeed he had not outgrown it quite&ndash;&ndash;and prepare to withstand
anew the assaults of the devil!</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&ndash;&ndash;to be specific, my son&ndash;&ndash;you mean&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; The great
man was sparring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we not heal the sick as he did?&rdquo; the boy explained
tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The peace-loving man of God breathed easier. How
simple! The devil was firing a cracked blunderbuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he advanced with paternal unction, &ldquo;you have
been taught&ndash;&ndash;or should have been, ere this&ndash;&ndash;that the healing
miracles of our blessed Saviour belong to a dispensation long
past. They were special signs from God, given at the time of
establishing His Church on earth, to convince an incredulous
multitude. They are not needed now. We convince by logic
and reason and by historical witnesses to the deeds of the
Saints and our blessed Saviour.&rdquo; As he pronounced this sacred
name the holy man devoutly crossed himself. &ldquo;Men would
believe no more readily to-day,&rdquo; he added easily, &ldquo;even if they
should see miracles of healing, for they would attribute them
to the human mentality, to suggestion, hypnotism, hallucination,
and the like. Even the mighty deeds of Christ were
attributed to Beelzebub.&rdquo; The complacent Father settled back
into his chair with an air of having disposed for all time of
the mooted subject of miracles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That begs the question, my Father!&rdquo; returned the boy
quickly and excitedly. &ldquo;And as I read church history it is
thus that the question has been begged ever since the first
century!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; The Archbishop was waxing hot. &ldquo;Do you, a
mere child of sixteen, dare to dispute the claims of Holy
Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; the boy spoke slowly and with awful earnestness,
&ldquo;I have been four years in the <i>Seminario</i>. I do not find
the true Christ there; nor do I think I shall find him within
the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sanctissima Maria!</i>&rdquo; The Archbishop bounded to his feet
&ldquo;Have you sold yourself to the devil?&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Have
you fed these years at the warm breasts of the Holy Mother,
only to turn now and rend her? Have you become a Protester?
Apostate and forsworn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; the boy returned calmly, &ldquo;did Jesus tell the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page34' name='book1_page34'></a>34</span>
truth&ndash;&ndash;or did he lie? If he spoke truth, then I think he is <i>not</i>
in the Church to-day. She has wholly misunderstood him&ndash;&ndash;or
else she&ndash;&ndash;she deliberately falsifies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop sank gasping into his chair.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went on. &ldquo;You call me apostate and forsworn. I
am neither. One cannot become apostate when he has never
believed. As to being forsworn&ndash;&ndash;I am a Rinc&oacute;n!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The erect head and flashing eyes of the youth drew an
involuntary exclamation of approval from the anxious secretary,
who had stood striving to evolve from his befuddled wits
some course adequate to the strained situation.</p>
<p>But the boy&rsquo;s proud bearing was only momentary. The
wonted look of troubled wistfulness again settled over his face,
and his shoulders bent to their accustomed stoop, as if his frail
body were slowly crushing beneath a tremendous burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Father,&rdquo; he continued sadly, &ldquo;do not the Gospels show
that Jesus proved the truth of all he taught by doing the works
which we call miracles? But does the Church to-day by any
great works prove a single one of her teachings? You say
that Christianity no longer needs the healing of the sick in
order to prove its claims. I answer that, if so, it likewise no
longer needs the preaching of the gospel, for I cannot find that
Jesus made any distinction between the two. Always he
coupled one with the other. His command was ever, &lsquo;Preach
the gospel, heal the sick!&rsquo; His works of healing were simply
signs which showed that he understood what he taught. They
were his proofs, and they followed naturally his great understanding
of God. But what proofs do you offer when you ask
mankind to accept your preaching? Jesus said, &lsquo;He that believeth
on me, the works that I do shall he do also.&rsquo; If you
do not do the works which he did, it shows plainly that you do
not believe on him&ndash;&ndash;that is, that you do not understand him.
When I am an ordained priest, and undertake to preach the
gospel to the world, must I confess to my people that I cannot
prove what I am teaching? Must I confess that there is no
proof within the Church? Is it not so, that true believers in
Jesus Christ believe exactly in the proportion in which they
obey him and do his works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy paused for breath. The Archbishop and his secretary
sat spellbound before him. Then he resumed&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the consecrated wafer through the words of a priest
becomes the real body of Christ, I am as yet unable to learn.
I do not believe it does. How priests can grant absolution for
sins when, to me, sins are forgiven only when they are forsaken,
I have not been taught. I do not believe they can. The
Church assumes to teach these things, but it cannot prove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page35' name='book1_page35'></a>35</span>
them. From the great works of Jesus and his apostles it has
descended to the blessing of <i>milagros</i> and candles, to the worship
of the Virgin and man-made Saints, to long processions,
to show and glitter&ndash;&ndash;while without her doors the poor, the
sick and the dying stretch out their thin, white hands and
beseech her to save them, not from hell or purgatory in a supposed
life to come, but from misery, want and ignorance right
here in this world, as Jesus told his followers they should do.
If you can show forth the omnipotence of God by healing the
sick and raising the dead, I could accept that as proof of your
understanding of the teachings of Jesus&ndash;&ndash;and what you <i>really</i>
understand you can demonstrate and teach to others. Theological
questions used to bother me, but they do so no longer.
Holy oil, holy water, blessed candles, incense, images and display
do not interest me as they did when a child, nor do they
any longer seem part of an intelligent worship of God. But&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;his
voice rising in animation&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to touch the blind man&rsquo;s eyes
and see them open; to bid the leper be clean, and see his skin
flush with health&ndash;&ndash;ah! that is to worship God in spirit and in
truth&ndash;&ndash;that is to prove that you understand what Jesus taught
and are obeying, not part, but <i>all</i> of his commands. I am not
apostate&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he concluded sadly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I never did fully believe that
the religion of Jesus is the religion which the Church to-day
preaches and pretends to practice. I do not believe in her
heaven, her purgatory or her hell, nor do I believe that her
Masses move God to release souls from torment. I do not
believe in her powers to pardon and curse. I do not believe in
her claims of infallibility. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment, as if not quite sure of his ground.
Then his face glowed with sudden eagerness, and he cried,
&ldquo;My Father, the Church needs the light&ndash;&ndash;do you not see it?&ndash;&ndash;do
you not, my uncle?&rdquo; turning appealingly to the hard-faced
secretary. &ldquo;Can we not work to help her, and through her
reach the world? Should not the Church rightly be the greatest
instrument for good? But how can she teach the truth when
she herself is so filled with error? How can she preach the
gospel when she knows not what the gospel is? But Jesus
said that if we obeyed him we should know of the doctrine,
should know the true meaning of the gospel. But we must
first obey. We must not only preach, but we must become
spiritually minded enough to heal the sick&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios nos guarde!</i>&rdquo; interrupted the Archbishop, attempting
to rise, but prevented by his secretary, who laid a restraining
hand on his arm. The latter then turned to the overwrought
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jos&egrave;,&rdquo; he said, smiling patronizingly upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page36' name='book1_page36'></a>36</span>
youth, although his cold eyes glittered like bits of polished
steel, &ldquo;His Eminence forgives your hasty words, for he recognizes
your earnestness, and, moreover, is aware how deeply
your heart is lacerated by your recent bereavement. But, further&ndash;&ndash;and
I say this in confidence to you&ndash;&ndash;His Eminence and
I have discussed these very matters to which you refer, and
have long seen the need of certain changes within the Church
which will redound to her glory and usefulness. And you must
know that the Holy Father in Rome also recognizes these needs,
and sees, too, the time when they will be met. However, his
great wisdom prevents him from acting hastily. You must
remember that our blessed Saviour suffered many things to be
so for the time, although he knew they would be altered in
due season. So it is with the Church. Her children are not all
deep thinkers, like yourself, but are for the most part poor and
ignorant people, who could not understand your high views.
They must be led in ways with which they are familiar until
they can be lifted gradually to higher planes of thought and
conduct. Is it not so? You are one who will do much for
them, my son&ndash;&ndash;but you will accomplish nothing by attempting
suddenly to overthrow the established traditions which they
reverence, nor by publicly prating about the Church&rsquo;s defects.
Your task will be to lead them gently, imperceptibly, up out
of darkness into the light, which, despite your accusations, <i>does</i>
shine in the Church, and is visible to all who rightly seek it.
You have yet four years in the <i>Seminario</i>. You gave us your
promise&ndash;&ndash;the Rinc&oacute;n word&ndash;&ndash;that you would lay aside these
doubts and questionings until your course was completed. We
do not hold you&ndash;&ndash;<i>but you hold yourself to your word</i>! Our
sincere advice is that you keep your counsel, and silently work
with us for the Church and mankind. The Church will offer
you unlimited opportunities for service. She is educating you.
Indeed, has she not generously given you the very data wherewith
you are enabled now to accuse her? You will find her
always the same just, tolerant, wise Mother, leading her
children upward as fast as they are able to journey. Her work
is universal, and she is impervious to the shafts of envy, malice,
and hatred which her enemies launch at her. She has resources
of which you as yet know nothing. In the end she will triumph.
You are offered an opportunity to contribute toward that
triumph and to share in it. His Eminence knows that you will
not permit Satan to make you reject that offer now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary&rsquo;s sharp, beady eyes looked straight into those
of the youth, and held him. His small, round head, with its
low brow and grizzled locks, waved snake-like on the man&rsquo;s
long neck. His tall form, in its black cassock, bent over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page37' name='book1_page37'></a>37</span>
lad like a spectre. His slender arms, of uncanny length, waved
constantly before him; and the long, bony fingers seemed to
reach into the boy&rsquo;s very soul and choke the springs of life at
their origin. His reasoning took the form of suggestion, bearing
the indisputable stamp of authority. Again, the boy, confused
and uncertain, bowed before years and worldly experience,
and returned to his solitude and the companionship
of his books and his writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occupy till I come,&rdquo; the patient Master had tenderly said.
From earliest boyhood Jos&egrave; had heard this clarion call
within his soul. And striving, delving, plodding, he had sought
to obey&ndash;&ndash;struggling toward the distant gleam, toward the realization
of something better and nearer the Master&rsquo;s thought than
the childish creeds of his fellow-men&ndash;&ndash;something warmer, more
vital than the pulseless decrees of ecumenical councils&ndash;&ndash;something
to solve men&rsquo;s daily problems here on earth&ndash;&ndash;something
to heal their diseases of body and soul, and lift them into that
realm of spiritual thinking where material pleasures, sensations,
and possessions no longer form the single aim and existence
of mankind, and life becomes what in reality it is, eternal
ecstasy! The Christ had promised! And Jos&egrave; would occupy
and wait in faith until, with joy inexpressible, he should behold
the shining form of the Master at the door of his opened tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Your Eminence&rsquo;s permission I will accompany the
boy back to Rome,&rdquo; the secretary said one day, shortly before
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s return to the seminary. &ldquo;I will consult with the Rector,
and suggest that certain and special tutelage be given the lad.
Let them bring their powers of reasoning and argument to bear
upon him, to the end that his thinking may be directed into
proper channels before it is too late. <i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; he muttered,
as with head bent and hands clasped behind his back he slowly
paced before the Archbishop. &ldquo;To think that he is a Rinc&oacute;n!
And yet, but sixteen&ndash;&ndash;a babe&ndash;&ndash;a mere babe!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_7' id='CHAPTER_7'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>
</div>
<p>It must have been, necessarily, a very complex set of causes
that could lay hold on a boy so really gifted as Jos&egrave; de
Rinc&oacute;n and, against his instincts and, on the part of those
responsible for the deed, with the certain knowledge of his
disinclination, urge him into the priesthood of a religious institution
with which congenitally he had but little in common.</p>
<p>To begin with, the bigoted and selfish desires of his parents
found in the boy&rsquo;s filial devotion a ready and sufficient means
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page38' name='book1_page38'></a>38</span>
of compelling him to any sacrifice of self. Only a thorough
understanding of the Spanish temperament will enable one to
arrive at a just estimate of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s character, and the sacredness
of the promises given his mother. Though the child might
pine and droop like a cankered rosebud, yet he would never
cease to regard the sanctity of his oath as eternally binding.
And the mother would accept the sacrifice, for her love for her
little son was clouded by her great ambitions in respect to his
earthly career, and her genuine solicitude for his soul&rsquo;s eternal
welfare.</p>
<p>Family tradition, sacred and inviolable, played its by no
means small part in this affair. Custom, now as inviolable as
the Jewish law, decreed that the first-born son should sink his
individuality into that of the Mother Church. And to the
Spaniard, <i>costumbre</i> is law. Again, the vacillating and hesitant
nature of the boy himself contributed largely to the result; for,
though supremely gifted in receptivity and broadness of mind,
in critical analysis and keenness of perception, he nevertheless
lacked the energy of will necessary to the shaping of a life-course
along normal lines. The boy knew what he preferred,
yet he said <i>Amen</i> both to the prayers of his parents and the
suggestions of doubt which his own mind offered. He was
weakest where the greatest firmness was demanded. His love
of study, his innate shrinking from responsibility, and his
repugnance toward discord and strife&ndash;&ndash;in a word, his lack of
fighting qualities&ndash;&ndash;naturally caused him to seek the lines of
least resistance, and thus afforded a ready advantage to those
who sought to influence him.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, such zeal on the part of the Archbishop
and his secretary in forcing upon the boy a career to
which they knew he was disinclined? Why should loyal agents
of the Church so tirelessly urge into the priesthood one who
might prove a serpent in her bosom?</p>
<p>The Archbishop may be dismissed from this discussion.
That his motives were wholly above the bias of worldly ambition,
we may not affirm. Yet we know that he was actuated
by zeal for the Church; that he had its advancement, its growth
in power and prestige always at heart. And we know that he
would have rejoiced some day to boast, &ldquo;We have saved to the
Church a brilliant son who threatened to become a redoubtable
enemy.&rdquo; The forces operating for and against this desideratum
seemed to him about equally matched. The boy was still very
young. His mind was as yet in the formative period, and would
be for some years. If the Church could secure her hold upon
him during this period she would doubtless retain it for all
time; for, as the sagacious secretary so often quoted to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page39' name='book1_page39'></a>39</span>
superior, &ldquo;Once a priest, always a priest,&rdquo; emphasizing the
tenet that the character imprinted by ordination is ineffaceable.</p>
<p>As for the secretary, he was a Rinc&oacute;n, proud and bigoted,
and withal fanatically loyal to the Church as an institution,
whatever its or his own degree of genuine piety. It was deeply
galling to his ecclesiastical pride to see the threatened development
of heretical tendencies in a scion of his house. These were
weeds which must and should be choked, cost what it might!
To this end any means were justified, for &ldquo;What doth it profit
a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&rdquo; And
the Rinc&oacute;n soul had been molded centuries ago. The secretary
hated the rapidly developing &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; spirit of the age and
the &ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; with a genuine and deadly hatred. His
curse rested upon all modern culture. To him, the Jesuit
college at Rome had established the level of intellectual freedom.
He worshiped the landmarks which the Fathers had
set, and he would have opposed their removal with his life.
No, the Rinc&oacute;n traditions must be preserved at whatever cost!
The heretical buddings within Jos&egrave; should be checked; he
should enter the priesthood; his thinking should be directed
into proper channels; his mind should be bent into conformity
with Holy Church! If not&ndash;&ndash;but there was no alternative.
The all-powerful Church could and would accomplish it.</p>
<p>In the choice of Rafa&eacute;l de Rinc&oacute;n as secretary and assistant,
the Archbishop had secured to himself a man of vast knowledge
of ecclesiastical matters, of great acumen, and exceptional ability.
The man was a Jesuit, and a positive, dynamic representative
of all that the order stands for. He was now in his sixty-eighth
year, but as vigorous of mind and body as if he bore
but half his burden of age. For some years prior to his connection
with the See of Seville he had served in the royal household
at Madrid. But, presumably at the request of Queen
Isabella, he had been peremptorily summoned to Rome some
three years before her exile; and when he again left the Eternal
City it was with the tentative papal appointment to Seville.</p>
<p>Just why Padre Rafa&eacute;l had been relieved of his duties in
Madrid was never divulged. But gossip supplied the paucity
of fact with the usual delectable speculations, the most persistent
of which had to do with the rumored birth of a royal
child. The deplorable conduct of the Queen after her enforced
marriage to Don Francisco D&rsquo;Assis had thrown the shadow of
suspicion on the legitimacy of all her children; and when it
began to be widely hinted that Padre Rafa&eacute;l, were he so disposed,
might point to a humble cottage in the sunlit hills of
Granada where lay a tiny <i>Infanta</i>, greatly resembling the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page40' name='book1_page40'></a>40</span>
famous singer and favorite of the Queen, Marfori, Marquis de
Loja, Isabella&rsquo;s alarm was sufficient to arouse the Vatican to
action. With the removal of Padre Rafa&eacute;l, and the bestowal
of the &ldquo;<i>Golden Rose of Faith and Virtue</i>&rdquo; upon the Queen by
His Holiness, Pio Nono, the rumor quickly subsided, and was
soon forgotten.</p>
<p>Whether because of this supposed secret Padre Rafa&eacute;l was
in favor at the court of Pio Nono&rsquo;s successor, we may not say.
The man&rsquo;s character was quite enigmatical, and divulged nothing.
But, if we may again appeal to rumor, he did appear to
have influence in papal circles. And we are not sure that he
did not seek to augment that influence by securing his irresolute
little nephew to the Church. And yet, the sincerity of his
devotion to the papacy cannot be questioned, as witness his
services to Pius IX., &ldquo;the first Christian to achieve infallibility,&rdquo;
during the troublesome years of 1870-71, when the French
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> all but scuttled the papal ship of state. And if now
he sought to use his influence at the Vatican, we shall generously
attribute it to his loyalty to Rinc&oacute;n traditions, and his
genuine concern for the welfare of the little Jos&egrave;, rather than to
any desire to advance his own ecclesiastical status.</p>
<p>But, it may be asked, during the eight years of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s course
in the seminary, did his tutors not mark the forces at work in
the boy&rsquo;s soul? And if so, why did they not urge his dismissal
as unfit for the calling of the priesthood?</p>
<p>Because, true to his promises, and stubbornly hugging the
fetish of family pride, the boy gave but little indication during
the first four years of his course of the heretical doubts and disbeliefs
fermenting within his troubled mind. And when, after
the death of his father and its consequent release of the flood of
protest and mental disquiet so long pent up within him, the
uncle returned to Rome with the lad to advise his instructors
to bring extra pressure to bear upon him in order to convince
him of the truths upon which the Church rested, Jos&egrave; subsided
again into his wonted attitude of placid endurance, even of
partial acceptance of the religious tutelage, and seldom gave
further sign of inner discord. Acting upon the suggestions of
the uncle, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s instructors took special pains to parade before
him the evidence and authorities supporting the claims of Holy
Church and the grand tenets upon which the faith reposed. In
particular were the arguments of Cardinal Newman cited to
him, and the study of the latter&rsquo;s Apology was made a requirement
of his course. The writings of the great Cardinal Manning
also were laid before him, and he was told to find therein
ample support for all assumptions of the Church.</p>
<p>Silently and patiently the boy to outward appearance acquiesced;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page41' name='book1_page41'></a>41</span>
but often the light of his midnight candle might have
revealed a wan face, frowning and perplexed, while before him
lay the Cardinal&rsquo;s argument for belief in the miraculous resuscitation
of the Virgin Mary&ndash;&ndash;the argument being that the story
is a beautiful one, and a comfort to those pious souls who think
it true!</p>
<p>Often, too, there lay before him the words of the great
Newman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You may be taken away young; you may live to fourscore;
you may die in your bed, or in the open field&ndash;&ndash;but if
Mary intercedes for you, that day will find you watching and
ready. All things will be fixed to secure your salvation, all
dangers will be foreseen, all obstacles removed, all aid provided.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as often he would close the book and drop his head in
wonder that a man so humanly great could believe in an infinite,
omnipotent God amenable to influence, even to that of the
sanctified Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Christ said, &lsquo;These signs shall follow them that believe,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he sometimes murmured, as he sat wrapped in study.
&ldquo;But do the Master&rsquo;s signs follow the Cardinals? Yet these
men say they believe. What can they do that other men can
not? Alas, nothing! What boots their sterile faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The limitations with which the lad was hedged about in
the <i>Seminario</i> quite circumscribed his existence there. All lay
influences were carefully excluded, and he learned only what
was selected for him by his teachers. Added to this narrowing
influence was his promise to his mother that he would read
nothing proscribed by the Church. Of Bible criticism, therefore,
he might know nothing. For original investigation of
authorities there was neither permission nor opportunity. He
was taught to discount historical criticism, and to regard anarchy
as the logical result of independence of thought. He was
likewise impressed with the fact that he must not question the
official acts of Holy Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he once remonstrated, &ldquo;it was by an ecumenical
council&ndash;&ndash;a group of frail human beings&ndash;&ndash;that the Pope was
declared infallible! And that only a few years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The council but set its seal of affirmation to an already
great and established fact,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;As the supreme
teacher and definer of the Church of God no Pope has ever
erred, nor ever can err, in the exposition of revealed truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Tito Cennini said in class but yesterday that many of
the Popes had been wicked men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must learn to distinguish, my son, between the man
and the office. No matter what the private life of a Pope may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page42' name='book1_page42'></a>42</span>
have been, the validity of his official acts is not thereby affected.
Nor is the doctrine of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my son; this is what the Church teaches; and to
slight it is to emperil your soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, despite his promises to his mother and the Archbishop,
and in despite, too, of his own conscientious endeavor to keep
every contaminating influence from entering his mind, he could
not prevent this same Tito from assiduously cultivating his
friendship, and voicing the most liberal and worldly opinions
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Perdio</i>, but you are an ignorant animal, Jos&egrave;!&rdquo; ejaculated
the little rascal one day, entering Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s room and throwing
himself upon the bed. &ldquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you know that the Popes
used to raise money by selling their pardons and indulgences?
That fellow Tetzel, back in Luther&rsquo;s time, rated sacrilege at
nine ducats, murder at seven, witchcraft at six, and so on.
Ever since the time of Innocent VIII. immunity from purgatory
could be bought. It was his chamberlain who used to say, &lsquo;God
willeth not the death of a sinner, but that he should pay and
live.&rsquo; Ha! ha! Those were good old days, <i>amico m&iacute;o</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the serious Jos&egrave;, to whom honor was a sacred thing,
saw not his companion&rsquo;s cause for mirth. &ldquo;Tito,&rdquo; he hazarded,
&ldquo;our instructor tells us that we must distinguish&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed the immodest Tito, &ldquo;if the Apostolic
virtue has been handed down from the great Peter through the
long line of Bishops of Rome and later Popes, what happened
to it when there were two or three Popes, in the Middle Ages?
And which branch retained the unbroken succession? Of a
truth, <i>amico</i>, you are very credulous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked at him horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which branch now,&rdquo; continued the irrepressible Tito,
&ldquo;holds a monopoly of the Apostolic virtue, the Anglican Church,
the Greek, or the Roman Catholic? For each claims it, and
each regards its rival claimants as rank heretics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; could not but dwell long and thoughtfully on this.
Then, later, he again sought the graceless Tito. &ldquo;<i>Amico</i>,&rdquo; he
said eagerly, &ldquo;why do not these claimants of the true Apostolic
virtue seek to prove their claims, instead of, like pouting children,
vainly spending themselves in denouncing their rivals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Prove them!</i>&rdquo; shouted Tito. &ldquo;And how, <i>amico m&iacute;o</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave; earnestly, &ldquo;by doing the works the
Apostles did; by healing the sick, and raising the dead, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tito answered with a mocking laugh. &ldquo;<i>Perdio, amico!</i>
know you not that if they submitted to such proof not one of
the various contestants could substantiate his claims?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page43' name='book1_page43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, oh, then how could the council declare the Pope to
be infallible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tito regarded his friend pityingly. &ldquo;My wonder is, <i>amico</i>,&rdquo;
he replied seriously, &ldquo;that they did not declare him <i>immortal</i>
as well. When you read the true history of those exciting
days and learn something of the political intrigue with which
the Church was then connected, you will see certain excellent
reasons why the Holy Father should have been declared infallible.
But let me ask you, <i>amico</i>, if you have such doubts, why are
you here, of all places? Surely it is not your own life-purpose
to become a priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life-purpose,&rdquo; answered Jos&egrave; meditatively, &ldquo;is to find
my soul&ndash;&ndash;my <i>real</i> self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tito went away shaking his head. He could not understand
such a character as that of Jos&egrave;. But, for that matter,
no one ever fathoms a fellow-being. And so we who have attempted
a sketch of the boy&rsquo;s mentality will not complain if
its complexity prevents us from adequately setting it forth.
Rather shall we feel that we have accomplished much if we
have shown that the lad had no slight justification for the budding
seeds of religious doubt within his mind, and for concluding
that of the constitution of God men know nothing, despite
their fantastical theories and their bold affirmations, as if He
were a man in their immediate neighborhood, with whom they
were on the most intimate terms.</p>
<p>In the course of time Jos&egrave; found the companionship of Tito
increasingly unendurable, and so he welcomed the formation
of another friendship among his mates, even though it was
with a lad much older than himself, Bernardo Damiano, a
candidate for ordination, and one thoroughly indoctrinated in
the faith of Holy Church. With open and receptive heart our
young Levite eagerly availed himself of his new friend&rsquo;s voluntary
discourses on the mooted topics about which his own
thought incessantly revolved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not, Jos&egrave;, to accept all that is taught you here,&rdquo; said
Bernardo in kindly admonition; &ldquo;for if this be not the very
doctrine of the Christ himself, where else will you find it?
Among the Protesters? Nay, they have, it is true, hundreds of
churches; and they call themselves Christians. But their religion
is as diverse as their churches are numerous, and it is not
of God or Jesus Christ. They have impiously borrowed from
us. Their emasculated creeds are only assumptions of human
belief. They recognize no law of consistency, and so they
enjoy unbridled license. They believe what they please, and
each interprets Holy Writ to suit his own fantastical whims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, the Popes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Jos&egrave;, returning again to his troublesome
topic.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page44' name='book1_page44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what of them?&rdquo; replied his friend calmly. &ldquo;Can
you not see beyond the human man to the Holy Office? The
Holy Father is the successor of the great Apostle Peter, whom
our blessed Saviour appointed his Vicar on earth, and constituted
the supreme teacher and judge in matters of morals.
Remember, <i>Jesus Christ founded the Catholic religion</i>! He
established the Church, which he commanded all men to support
and obey. That Church is still, and always will be, the
infallible teacher of truth, for Jesus declared that it should
never fall. Let not Satan lead you to the Protesters, Jos&egrave;, for
their creeds are but snares and pitfalls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of Protestant creeds, nor want to,&rdquo; answered
Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;If Jesus Christ established the Catholic religion,
then I want to accept it, and shall conclude that my doubts and
questionings are but the whisperings of Satan. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, my friend? The Popes again?&rdquo; Bernardo laughed,
and put his arm affectionately about the younger lad. &ldquo;The
Pope, Jos&egrave;, is, always has been, and always will be, supreme,
crowned with the triple crown as king of earth, and heaven,
and hell. We mortals have not made him so. Heaven alone
did that. God himself made our Pontiff of the Holy Catholic
Church superior even to the angels; and if it were possible for
them to believe contrary to the faith, he could judge them and
lay the ban of excommunication upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s eyes widened while his friend talked. Was he losing
his own senses? Or was it true, as his lamented father had
said, that he had been cast under the spell of the devil&rsquo;s wiles?
Had he been foreordained to destruction by his own heretical
thought? For, if what he heard in Rome was truth, then was
he damned, irrevocably!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said his friend, taking his arm; &ldquo;let us go to the
library and read the <i>Credo</i> of the Holy Father, Pius the Fourth,
wherein is set forth in detail the doctrinal system of our beloved
Church. And let me urge you, my dear young friend, to
accept it, unreservedly, and be at peace, else will your life be a
ceaseless torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, that he could have done so! That he could have joined
those thousands of faithful, loyal adherents to Holy Church,
who find in its doctrines naught that stimulates a doubt, nor
urges against the divine institution of its gorgeous, material
fabric!</p>
<p>But, vain desire! &ldquo;I cannot! I cannot!&rdquo; he wailed in the
dark hours of night upon his bed. &ldquo;I cannot love a God who
has to be prayed to by Saints and Virgin, and persuaded by
them not to damn His own children! I cannot believe that the
Pope, a mere human being, can canonize Saints and make spiritual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page45' name='book1_page45'></a>45</span>
beings who grant the prayers of men and intercede with
God for them! Yes, I know there are multitudes of good people
who believe and accept the doctrines of the Church. But,
alas! I am not one of them, nor can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, we repeat, the little Jos&egrave; was morbidly honest. And
this gave rise to fear, a corroding fear that he might not do
right by his God, his mother, and himself, the three variants in
his complex life-equation. His self-condemnation increased;
yet his doubts kept pace with it. He more than ever distrusted
his own powers after his first four years in the seminary. He
more than ever lacked self-confidence. He was more than ever
vacillating, hesitant, and infirm of purpose. He even at times,
when under the pall of melancholia, wondered if he had really
loved his deceased father, and whether it was real grief which
he felt at his parent&rsquo;s demise. Often, too, when fear and doubt
pressed heavily, and his companions avoided him because of the
aura of gloom in which he dwelt, he wondered if he were becoming
insane. He seemed to become obsessed with the belief
that his ability to think was slowly paralyzing. And with it
his will. And yet, proof that this was not the case was found
in his stubborn opposition to trite acquiescence, and in his infrequent
reversals of mood, when he would even feel an intense,
if transient, sense of exaltation in the thought that he was
doing the best that in him lay.</p>
<p>It was during one of these lighter moods, and at the close of
a school year, that a great joy came to him in an event which
left a lasting impress upon his life. Following close upon a
hurried visit which his uncle paid to Rome, the boy was informed
that it had been arranged for him to accompany the
Papal Legate on a brief journey through Germany and England,
returning through France, in order that he might gain a
first-hand impression of the magnitude of the work which the
Church was doing in the field, and meet some of her great men.
The broadening, quieting, confidence-inspiring influence of such
a journey would be, in the opinion of Padre Rafa&eacute;l, incalculable.
And so, with eager, bubbling hope, the lad set out.</p>
<p>Whatever it may have been intended that the boy should
see on this ecclesiastical pilgrimage, he returned to Rome at the
end of three months with his quick, impressionable mind stuffed
with food for reflection. Though he had seen the glories
of the Church, worshiped in her matchless temples, and sat
at the feet of her great scholars, now in the quiet of his little
room he found himself dwelling upon a single thought, into
which all of his collected impressions were gathered: &ldquo;The
Church&ndash;&ndash;Catholic and Protestant&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;oh, God, the Church is&ndash;&ndash;not
sick, not dying, but&ndash;&ndash;<i>dead</i>! Aye, it has served both God
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page46' name='book1_page46'></a>46</span>
and Mammon, and paid the awful penalty! And what is left?
<i>Caesarism</i>!&rdquo; The great German and British nations were not
Catholic. But worse, the Protestant people of the German Empire
were sadly indifferent to religion. He had seen, in Berlin,
men of family trying to resell the Bibles which their children
had used in preparation for confirmation. He had found family
worship all but extinct. He had marked the widespread indifference
among Protestant parents in regard to the religious
instruction of their young. He had been told there that parents
had but a slight conception of their duty as moral guides, and
that children were growing up with only sensuous pleasures
and material gain as their life-aims. Again and again he was
shown where in whole districts it was utterly impossible to secure
young men for ordination to the Protestant ministry. And
he was furnished with statistics setting forth the ominous fact
that within a few years, were the present decline unchecked,
there would be no students in the Protestant universities of the
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not see in this, my son,&rdquo; said the Papal Legate,
&ldquo;the blight of unbelief? Do you not mark the withering effects
of the modern so-called scientific thought? What think you of
a religion wherein the chief interest centers in trials for heresy;
whose ultimate effect upon human character is a return to the
raw, primitive, immature sense of life that once prevailed among
this great people? What think you now of Luther and his
diabolical work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wondering boy hung his head without reply. Would
Germany at length come to the true fold? And was that fold
the Holy Catholic Church?</p>
<p>And England&ndash;&ndash;ah! there was the Anglican church, Catholic,
but not Roman, and therefore but a counterfeit of the Lord&rsquo;s
true Church. Would it endure? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Legate had said;
&ldquo;already defection has set in, and the prodigal&rsquo;s return to the
loving parent in Rome is but a matter of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came his visit to the great abbey of Westminster, and
the impression which, to his last earthly day, he bore as one of
his most sacred treasures. There in the famous Jerusalem
Chamber he had sat, his eyes suffused with tears and his throat
choked with emotion. In that room the first Lancastrian king
long years before had closed his unhappy life. There the great
Westminster Confession had been framed. There William of
Orange had held his weighty discussion of the Prayer-Book
revision, which was hoped to bring Churchmen and Dissenters
again into harmony. And there, greatest of all, had gathered,
day after day, and year after year, the patient, devoted group
of men who gave to the world its Revised Edition of the Holy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page47' name='book1_page47'></a>47</span>
Bible, only a few brief years ago. As the rapt Jos&egrave; closed his
eyes and listened to the whispered conversation of the scholarly
men about him, he seemed to see the consecrated Revisers,
seated again at the long table, deep in the holy search of the
Scriptures for the profound secrets of life which they hold. He
saw with what sedulous care they pursued their sacred work,
without trace of prejudice or religious bias, and with only the
selfless purpose always before them to render to mankind a
priceless benefit in a more perfect rendition of the Word of God.
Why could not men come together now in that same generous
spirit of love? But no, Rome would never yield her assumptions.
But when the lad rose and followed his guides from the room,
it was with a new-born conviction, and a revival of his erstwhile
firm purpose to translate for himself, at the earliest opportunity,
the Greek Testament, if, perchance, he might find thereby what
his yearning soul so deeply craved, the truth.</p>
<p>That the boy was possessed of scholarly instincts, there
could be no doubt. His ability had immediately attracted his
instructors on entering the seminary. And, but for his stubborn
opposition to dogmatic acceptance without proofs, he
might have taken and maintained the position of leader in
scholarship in the institution. Literature and the languages,
particularly Greek, were his favorite studies, and in these he
excelled. Even as a child, long before the eventful night when
his surreptitious reading of Voltaire precipitated events, he
had determined to master Greek, and some day to translate the
New Testament from the original sources into his beloved Castilian
tongue. Before setting out for Rome he had so applied
himself to the worn little grammar which the proprietor of the
bookstall in Seville had loaned him, that he was able to make
translations with comparative fluency. In the seminary he
plunged into it with avidity; and when he returned from his
journey with the Papal Legate he began in earnest his translation
of the Testament. This, like so much of the boy&rsquo;s work
and writing, was done secretly and in spare moments. And his
zeal was such that often in the middle of the night it would
compel him to rise and, after drawing the shades carefully and
stopping the crack under the door with his cassock, light his
candle and dig away at his Testament until dawn.</p>
<p>This study of the New Testament in the Greek resulted in
many translations differing essentially from the accepted version,
as could not but happen when a mind so original as that
of the boy Jos&egrave; was concentrated upon it. His first stumbling
block was met in the prayer of Jesus in an attempt to render
the petition, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread,&rdquo; into idiomatic
modern thought. The word translated &ldquo;daily&rdquo; was not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page48' name='book1_page48'></a>48</span>
found elsewhere in the Greek language. Evidently the Aramaic
word which Jesus employed, and of which this Greek word was
a translation, must have been an unusual one&ndash;&ndash;a coined expression.
And what did it mean? No one knows. Jos&egrave; found
means to put the question to his tutor. He was told that it
doubtless meant &ldquo;super-supernal.&rdquo; But what could &ldquo;super-supernal&rdquo;
convey to the world&rsquo;s multitude of hungry suppliants
for the bread of life! And so he rendered the phrase &ldquo;Give us
each day a better understanding of Thee.&rdquo; Again, going carefully
through his Testament the boy crossed out the words
translated &ldquo;God,&rdquo; and in their places substituted &ldquo;divine influence.&rdquo;
Many of the best known and most frequently quoted
passages suffered similarly radical changes at his hands. For
the translation &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; the boy often preferred to substitute
&ldquo;reality&rdquo;; and such passages as &ldquo;speaking the truth in love&rdquo;
were rendered by him, &ldquo;lovingly speaking of those things which
are real.&rdquo; &ldquo;Faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;belief&rdquo; were generally changed to
&ldquo;understanding&rdquo; and &ldquo;real knowing,&rdquo; so that the passage, &ldquo;O
ye of little faith,&rdquo; became in his translation, &ldquo;O ye of slight
understanding.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; he consistently changed
to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; throughout. The command to ask &ldquo;in the name of
Jesus&rdquo; caused him hours of deep and perplexing thought, until
he hit upon the, to him, happy rendering, &ldquo;in his character.&rdquo;
Why not? In the character of the Christ mankind might ask
anything and it would be given them. But to acquire that
character men must repent. And the Greek word &ldquo;metanoia,&rdquo;
so generally rendered &ldquo;repentance,&rdquo; would therefore have to be
translated &ldquo;radical and complete change of thought.&rdquo; Again,
why not? Was not a complete change of thought requisite if
one were to become like Jesus? Could mortals think continually
of murder, warfare, disaster, failure, crime, sickness and death,
and of the acquisition of material riches and power, and still
hope to acquire the character of the meek but mighty Nazarene?
Decidedly no! And so he went on delving and plodding, day
after day, night after night, substituting and changing, but
always, even if unconsciously, giving to the Scripture a more
metaphysical and spiritual meaning, which displaced in its
translation much of the material and earthy.</p>
<p>Before the end of his seminary training the translation was
complete. What a new light it seemed to throw upon the mission
of Jesus! How fully he realized now that creeds and confessions
had never even begun to sound the profound depths of
the Bible! What a changed message it seemed to carry for
mankind! How he longed to show it to his preceptors and
discuss it with them! But his courage failed when he faced this
thought. However, another expedient presented: he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page49' name='book1_page49'></a>49</span>
write a treatise on the New Testament, embodying the salient
facts of his translation, and send it out into the world for publication
in the hope that it might do much good. Again, night
after night in holy zeal he toiled on the work, and when completed,
sent it, under his name, to a prominent literary magazine
published in Paris.</p>
<p>Its appearance&ndash;&ndash;for it was accepted eagerly by the editor,
who was bitterly hostile to the Church&ndash;&ndash;caused a stir in ecclesiastical
circles and plunged the unwise lad into a sea of trouble.
The essay in general might have been excusable on its distinct
merits and the really profound scholarship exhibited in its
composition. But when the boy, a candidate for holy orders,
and almost on the eve of his ordination, seized upon the famous
statement of Jesus in which he is reported to have told Peter
that he was the rock upon which the Lord&rsquo;s church should be
eternally founded, and showed that Jesus called Peter a stone,
&ldquo;<i>petros</i>,&rdquo; a loose stone, and one of many, whereas he then said
that his church should be founded upon &ldquo;<i>petra</i>,&rdquo; the living,
immovable rock of truth, thus corroborating Saint Augustine,
but confuting other supposedly impregnable authority for the
superiority and infallibility of the Church, it was going a bit
too far.</p>
<p>The result was severe penance, coupled with soul-searing
reprimand, and absolute prohibition of further original writing.
His translation of the Testament was confiscated, and he
was commanded to destroy all notes referring to it, and to refrain
from making further translations. His little room was
searched, and all references and papers which might be construed
as unevangelical were seized and burned. He was then
transferred to another room for the remainder of his seminary
course, and given a roommate, a cynical, sneering bully of Irish
descent, steeped to the core in churchly doctrine, who did not
fail to embrace every opportunity to make the suffering penitent
realize that he was in disgrace and under surveillance. The
effect was to drive the sensitive boy still further into himself,
and to augment the sullenness of disposition which had earlier
characterized him and separated him from social intercourse
with the world in which he moved apart from his fellow-men.</p>
<p>Thus had Jos&egrave; been shown very clearly that implicit obedience
would at all times be exacted from him by the Church.
He had been shown quite unmistakably that an inquisitive and
determined spirit would not be tolerated if it led to deductions
at variance with accepted tradition. He might starve mentally,
if his prescribed food did not satisfy his hunger; but he must
understand, once for all, that truth had long since been revealed,
and that it was not within his province to attempt any
further additions to the revelation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page50' name='book1_page50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>Once more, for the sake of his mother, and that he might
learn all that the Church had to teach him, the boy conscientiously
tried to obey. He was reminded again that, though
taught to obey, he was being trained to lead. This in a sense
pleased him, as offering surcease from an erking sense of responsibility.
Nevertheless, though he constantly wavered in
decision; though at times the Church won him, and he yielded
temporarily to her abundant charms; the spirit of protest did
wax steadily stronger within him as the years passed. Back
and forth he swung, like a pendulum, now drawn by the power
and influence of the mighty Church; now, as he approached it,
repelled by the things which were revealed as he drew near. In
the last two years of his course his soul-revolt often took the
form of open protest to his preceptors against indulgences and
the sacramental graces, against the arbitrary Index Expurgatorius,
and the Church&rsquo;s stubborn opposition to modern progression.
Like Faust, his studies were convincing him more
and more firmly of the emptiness of human hypotheses and
undemonstrable philosophy. The growing conviction that the
Holy Church was more worldly than spiritual filled his shrinking
soul at times with horror. The limiting thought of Rome
was often stifling to him. He had begun to realize that liberty
of thought and conscience were his only as he received it already
outlined from the Church. Even his interpretation of
the Bible must come from her. His very ideas must first receive
the ecclesiastical stamp before he might advance them. His
opinions must measure up&ndash;&ndash;or down&ndash;&ndash;to those of his tutors,
ere he might even hold them. In terror he felt that the Church
was absorbing him, heart and mind. His individuality was
seeping away. In time he would become but a link in the
great worldly system which he was being trained to serve.</p>
<p>These convictions did not come to him all at once, nor were
they as yet firmly fixed. They were rather suggestions which
became increasingly insistent as the years went on. He had
entered the seminary at the tender age of twelve, his mind
wholly unformed, but protesting even then. All through his
course he had sought what there was in Christianity upon which
he could lay firm hold. In the Church he had found an ultra-conservative
spirit and extreme reverence for authority. Tito
had told him that it was the equivalent of ancestor-worship. But
when he one day told his instructors that he was not necessarily
a disbeliever in the Scriptures because he did not accept
their interpretation of them, he could not but realize that Tito
had come dangerously near the truth. His translation of the
Greek Testament had forced him to the conclusion that much of
the material contained in the Gospels was not Jesus&rsquo; own words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page51' name='book1_page51'></a>51</span>
but the commentaries of his reporters; not the Master&rsquo;s diction,
but theological lecturing by the writers of the Gospels. Moreover,
in the matter of prayer, especially, he was all at sea. As
a child he had spent hours formulating humble, fervent petitions,
which did not seem to draw replies. And so there began
to form within his mind a concept, faint and ill-defined, of a
God very different from that canonically accepted. He tried to
believe that there was a Creator back of all things, but that He
was inexorable Law. And the lad was convinced that, somehow,
he had failed to get into harmony with that infinite Law.
But, in that case, why pray to Law? And, most foolish of all,
why seek to influence it, whether through Virgin or Saint? And,
if God is a good Father, why ask Him to <i>be</i> good? Then, to his
insistent question, &ldquo;<i>Unde Deus</i>?&rdquo; he tried to formulate the answer
that God is Spirit, and omnipresent. But, alas! that made
the good God include evil. No, there was a terrible human
misunderstanding of the divine nature, a woeful misinterpretation.
He must try to ask for light in the character of the
Christ. But then, how to assume that character? Like a garment?
Impossible! &ldquo;Oh, God above,&rdquo; he wailed aloud again
and again, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to believe! I don&rsquo;t know what
to think!&rdquo; Foolish lad! Why did he think at all, when there
were those at hand to relieve him of that onerous task?</p>
<p>And so, at last, Jos&egrave; sought to resign himself to his fate,
and, thrusting aside these mocking questions, accept the opportunities
for service which his tutors so wisely emphasized
as the Church&rsquo;s special offering to him. He yielded to their
encouragement to plunge heartily into his studies, for in such
absorption lay diversion from dangerous channels of thought.
Slowly, too, he yielded to their careful insistence that he must
suffer many things to be so for the nonce, even as Jesus did,
lest a too radical resistance now should delay the final glorious
consummation.</p>
<p>Was the boy actuated too strongly by the determination
that his widowed mother&rsquo;s hopes should never be blasted by
any assertion of his own will? Was he passively permitting
himself to be warped and twisted into a minion of an institution
alien to his soul in bigoted adherence to his morbid sense of
integrity? Was he for the present countenancing a lie, rather
than permit the bursting of a bomb which would rend the
family and bring his beloved mother in sorrow to the grave?
Or was he biding his time, an undeveloped David, who would
some day sally forth like the lion of the tribe of Juda, to match
his moral courage against the blustering son of Anak? Time
only would tell. The formative period of his character was not
yet ended, and the data for prognostication were too complex
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page52' name='book1_page52'></a>52</span>
and conflicting. We can only be sure that his consuming desire
to know had been carefully fostered in the seminary, but in
such a manner as unwittingly to add to his confusion of thought
and to increase his fear of throwing himself unreservedly upon
his own convictions. That he grew to perceive the childishness
of churchly dogma, we know. That he appreciated the Church&rsquo;s
insane license of affirmation, its impudent affirmations of God&rsquo;s
thoughts and desires, its coarse assumptions of knowledge of
the inner workings of the mind of Omnipotence, we likewise
know. But, on the other hand, we know that he feared to break
with the accepted faith. The claims of Protestantism, though
lacking the pomp and pageantry of Catholicism to give them attractiveness,
offered him an interpretation of Christ&rsquo;s mission
that was little better than the teachings he was receiving. And
so his hesitant and vacillating nature, which hurled him into
the lists to-day as the resolute foe of dogma and superstition,
and to-morrow would leave him weak and doubting at the feet
of the enemy, kept him wavering, silent and unhappy, on the
thin edge of resolution throughout the greater part of his
course. His lack of force, or the holding of his force in check
by his filial honesty and his uncertainty of conviction, kept
him in the seminary for eight years, during which his being
was slowly, imperceptibly descending into him. At the age of
twenty he was still unsettled, but further than even he himself
realized from Rome. Who shall say that he was not at the
same time nearer to God?</p>
<p>On the day that he was twenty, three things of the gravest
import happened to the young Jos&egrave;. His warm friend, Bernardo,
died suddenly, almost in his arms; his uncle, Rafa&eacute;l de
Rinc&oacute;n, paid an unexpected visit to the Vatican; and the lad
received the startling announcement that he would be ordained
to the priesthood on the following day.</p>
<p>The sudden demise of the young Bernardo plunged Jos&egrave;
into an excess of grief and again encompassed him with the
fear and horror of death. He shut himself up in his room, and
toward the close of the day took his writing materials and
penned a passionate appeal to his mother, begging her to absolve
him from his promises, and let him go out into the world, a
free man in search of truth. But scarcely had he finished his
letter when he was summoned into the Rector&rsquo;s office. There
it was explained to him that, in recognition of his high scholarship,
of his penitence and loyal obedience since the Testament
episode, and of the advanced work which he was now doing in
the seminary and the splendid promise he was giving, the Holy
Father had been asked to grant a special indult, waiving the
usual age requirement and permitting the boy to be ordained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page53' name='book1_page53'></a>53</span>
with the class which was to receive the holy order of the priesthood
the following day. It was further announced that after
ordination he should spend a year in travel with the Papal
Legate, and on his return might enter the office of the Papal
Secretary of State, as an under-secretary, or office assistant.
While there, he would be called upon to teach in the seminary,
and later might be sent to the University to pursue higher
studies leading to the degree of Doctor.</p>
<p>Before the boy had awakened to his situation, the day of his
ordination arrived. The proud mother, learning from the secretary
of the precipitation of events, and doting on the boy whom
she had never understood; in total ignorance of the complex
elements of his soul, and little realizing that between her and
her beloved son there was now a gulf fixed which would never
be bridged, saw only the happy fruition of a life ambition. Fortunately
she had been kept in ignorance of the dubious incident
of the Testament translation and its results upon the boy; and
when the long anticipated day dawned her eyes swam in tears
of hallowed joy. The Archbishop and his grim secretary each
congratulated the other heartily, and the latter, breaking into
one of his rare smiles, murmured gratefully, &ldquo;At last! And our
enemies have lost a champion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night before the ordination Jos&egrave; had begged to occupy
a room alone. The appeal which emanated from his sad face,
his thin and stooping body, his whole drawn and tortured being,
would have melted flint. His request was granted. Throughout
the night the boy, on his knees beside the little bed, wrestled
with the emotions which were tearing his soul. Despondency
lay over him like a pall. A vague presentiment of impending
disaster pressed upon him like a millstone. Ceaselessly he
weighed and reviewed the forces which had combined to drive
him into the inconsistent position which he now occupied. Inconsistent,
for his highest ideal had been truth. He was by
nature consecrated to it. He had sought it diligently in the
Church, and now that he was about to become her priest he
could not make himself believe that he had found it. Now,
when bound to her altars, he faced a life of deception, of falsehood,
as the champion of a faith which he could not unreservedly
embrace.</p>
<p>But he had accepted his education from the Church; and
would he shrink from making payment therefor? Yet, on the
other hand, must he sacrifice honor&ndash;&ndash;yea, his whole future&ndash;&ndash;to
the payment of a debt forced upon him before he had reached
the age of reason? The oath of ordination, the priest&rsquo;s oath,
echoed in his throbbing ears like a soul-sentence to eternal
doom; while spectral shades of moving priests and bishops, laying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page54' name='book1_page54'></a>54</span>
cold and unfeeling hands upon him, sealing him to endless
servitude to superstition and deception, glided to and fro
through the darkness before his straining eyes. Could he receive
the ordination to-morrow? He had promised&ndash;&ndash;but the
assumption of its obligations would brand his shrinking soul
with torturing falsehood! If he sank under doubt and fear,
could he still retract? What then of his mother and his promise
to her? What of the Rinc&oacute;n honor and pride? Living disgrace,
or a living lie&ndash;&ndash;which? Sacrifice of self&ndash;&ndash;or mother?
God knew, he had never deliberately countenanced a falsehood&ndash;&ndash;yet,
through circumstances which he did not have the will
to control, he was a living one!</p>
<p>Fair visions of a life untrammeled by creed or religious convention
hovered at times that night before his mental gaze. He
saw a cottage, rose-bowered, glowing in the haze of the summer
sun. He saw before its door a woman, fresh and fair&ndash;&ndash;his wife&ndash;&ndash;and
children&ndash;&ndash;his&ndash;&ndash;shouting their joyous greetings as they
trooped out to welcome him returning from his day&rsquo;s labors.
How he clung to this picture when it faded and left him, an
oath-bound celibate, facing his lonely and cheerless destiny!
God! what has the Church to offer for such sacrifice as this!
An education? Yea, an induction into relative truths and mortal
opinions, and the sad record of the devious wanderings of
the human mind! An opportunity for service? God knows,
the free, unhampered mind, open to truth and progress, loosed
from mediaeval dogma and ignorant convention, seeing its
brothers&rsquo; needs and meeting in them its own, has opportunities
for rich service to-day outside the Church the like of which
have never before been offered!</p>
<p>To and fro his heaving thought ebbed and flowed. Back and
forth the arguments, pro and con, surged through the still hours
of the night. After all, had he definite proof that the tenets of
Holy Church were false? No, he could not honestly say that he
had. The question still stood in abeyance. Even his conviction
of their falsity at times had sorely wavered. And if his heart
cried out against their acceptance, it nevertheless had nothing
tangibly definite to offer in substitution. But&ndash;&ndash;the end had
come so suddenly! With his life free and untrammeled he might
yet find the truth. Oath-bound and limited to the strictures of
the Church, what hope was there but the acceptance of prescribed
canons of human belief? Still, the falsities which he
believed he had found within the Church were not greater than
those against which she herself fought in the world. And if
she accepted him, did it not indicate on her part a tacit recognition
of the need of just what he had to offer, a searching spirit
of inquiry and consecration to the unfoldment of truth? Alas!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page55' name='book1_page55'></a>55</span>
the incident of the Greek translation threw its shadow of doubt
upon that hope.</p>
<p>But if the Church accepted him, she <i>must</i> accept his stand!
He <i>would</i> raise his voice in protest, and would continually point
to the truth as he discerned it! If he received the order of
priesthood from her it was with the understanding that his acceptance
of her tenets was tentative! But&ndash;&ndash;forlorn expedient!
He knew something of ecclesiastical history. He thought he
knew&ndash;&ndash;young as he was&ndash;&ndash;that the Church stood not for progress,
not for conformity to changing ideals, not for alignment
with the world&rsquo;s great reforms, but for <i>herself</i>, first, midst, and
last!</p>
<p>Thus the conflict raged, while thoughts, momentous for
even a mature thinker, tore through the mind of this lad of
twenty. Prayers for light&ndash;&ndash;prayers which would have rent the
heart of an Ivan&ndash;&ndash;burst at times from the feverish lips of this
child of circumstance. Infinite Father&ndash;&ndash;Divine Influence&ndash;&ndash;Spirit
of Love&ndash;&ndash;whatever Thou art&ndash;&ndash;wilt Thou not illumine the
thought-processes of this distracted youth and thus provide the
way of escape from impending destruction? Can it be Thy
will that this fair mind shall be utterly crushed? Do the agonized
words of appeal which rise to Thee from his riven soul fall
broken against ears of stone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occupy till I come!&rdquo; Yea, beloved Master, he hears thy
voice and strives to obey&ndash;&ndash;but the night is filled with terror&ndash;&ndash;the
clouds of error lower about him&ndash;&ndash;the storm bursts&ndash;&ndash;and
thou art not there!</p>
<p>Day dawned. A classmate, sent to summon the lad, roused
him from the fitful sleep into which he had sunk on the cold
floor. His mind was no longer active. Dumbly following his
preceptors at the appointed hour, he proceeded with the class
to the chapel. Dimly conscious of his surroundings, his thought
befogged as if in a dream, his eyes half-blinded by the gray
haze which seemed to hang before them, he celebrated the Mass,
like one under hypnosis, received the holy orders, and assumed
the obligations which constituted him a priest of Holy Church.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>
</div>
<p>On a sweltering midsummer afternoon, a year after the
events just related, Rome lay panting for breath and
counting the interminable hours which must elapse before
the unpitying sun would grant her a short night&rsquo;s respite from
her discomfort. Her streets were deserted by all except those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page56' name='book1_page56'></a>56</span>
whose affairs necessitated their presence in them. Her palaces
and villas had been abandoned for weeks by their fortunate
owners, who had betaken themselves to the seashore or to the
more distance resorts of the North. The few inexperienced
tourists whose lack of practical knowledge in the matter of
globe-trotting had brought them into the city so unseasonably
were hastily and indignantly assembling their luggage and
completing arrangements to flee from their over-warm reception.</p>
<p>In a richly appointed suite of the city&rsquo;s most modern and
ultra-fashionable hotel two maids, a butler, and the head porter
were packing and removing a formidable array of trunks and
suit cases, while a woman of considerably less than middle age,
comely in person and tastefully attired in a loose dressing
gown of flowered silk, alternated between giving sharp directions
to the perspiring workers and venting her abundant wrath
and disappointment upon the chief clerk, as with evident reluctance
she filled one of a number of signed checks to cover
the hotel expenses of herself and servants for a period of three
weeks, although they had arrived only the day before and, on
account of the stifling heat, were leaving on the night express
for Lucerne. The clerk regretted exceedingly, but on Madam
Ames&rsquo; order the suite had been held vacant for that length of
time, during which the management had daily looked for her
arrival, and had received no word of her delay. Had Madam
herself not just admitted that she had altered her plans en
route, without notifying the hotel, and had gone first to the
Italian lakes, without cancelling her order for the suite? And
so her sense of justice must convince her that the management
was acting wholly within its rights in making this demand.</p>
<p>While the preparations for departure were in progress the
woman&rsquo;s two children played about the trunks and raced
through the rooms and adjoining corridor with a child&rsquo;s indifference
to climatal conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ring for the elevator and then hide, Sidney!&rdquo; suggested
the girl, as she panted after her brother, who had run to
the far end of the long hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Kathleen, it wouldn&rsquo;t be right,&rdquo; objected the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right! Ho! ho! What&rsquo;s the harm, goody-goody? Go tell
mother, if you want to!&rdquo; she called after him, as he started back
to their rooms. Refusing to accompany him, the girl leaned
against the balustrade of a stairway which led to the floor below
and watched her brother until he disappeared around a turn of
the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo; burst from her pouting lips. &ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid of everything!
It&rsquo;s no fun playing with him!&rdquo; Then, casting a glance of inquiry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page57' name='book1_page57'></a>57</span>
about her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to hide down these stairs. Mother and
nurse never let me go where I want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obeying the impulse stimulated by her freedom for the
moment, the child suddenly turned and darted down the stairway.
On the floor beneath she found herself at the head of a
similar stairway, down which she likewise hurried, with no
other thought than to annoy her brother, who was sure to be
sent in search of her when her mother discovered her absence.
Opening the door below, the child unexpectedly found herself
in an alley back of the hotel.</p>
<p>Her sense of freedom was exhilarating. The sunlit alley
beckoned to a delightful journey of discovery. With a happy
laugh and a toss of her yellow curls she hurried along the narrow
way and into the street which crossed it a short distance
beyond. Here she paused and looked in each direction, uncertain
which way to continue. In one direction, far in the distance,
she saw trees. They looked promising; she would go
that way. And trotting along the blazing, deserted street, she
at length reached the grateful shade and threw herself on the
soft grass beneath, tired and panting, but happy in the excitement
of her little adventure.</p>
<p>Recovering quickly, the child rose to explore her environment.
She was in one of those numerous public parks lining
the Tiber and forming the city&rsquo;s playground for her less fortunate
wards. Here and there were scattered a few people,
mostly men, who had braved the heat of the streets in the hope
of obtaining a breath of cool air near the water. At the river&rsquo;s
edge a group of ragged urchins were romping noisily; and on
a bench near them a young priest sat, writing in a notebook.
As she walked toward them a beggar roused himself from the
grass and looked covetously through his evil eyes at the child&rsquo;s
rich clothes.</p>
<p>The gamins stopped their play as the girl approached, and
stared at her in expectant curiosity. One of them, a girl of
apparently her own age, spoke to her, but in a language which
she did not understand. Receiving no reply, the urchins suddenly
closed together, and holding hands, began to circle around
her, shouting like little Indians.</p>
<p>The child stood for a moment perplexed. Then terror seized
her. Hurling herself through the circle, she fled blindly, with
the gamins in pursuit. With no sense of direction, her only
thought to escape from the dirty band at her heels, she rushed
straight to the river and over the low bank into the sluggish,
yellow water. A moment later the priest who had been sitting
on the bench near the river, startled by the frenzied cries of the
now frightened children, rushed into the shallow water and
brought the girl in safety to the bank.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page58' name='book1_page58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>Speaking to her in her own language, the priest sought to
soothe the child and learn her identity as he carried her to the
edge of the park and out into the street. But his efforts were
unavailing. She could only sob hysterically and call piteously
for her mother. A civil guard appeared at the street corner,
and the priest summoned him. But scarcely had he reported
the details of the accident when, suddenly uttering a cry, the
priest thrust the girl into the arms of the astonished officer and
fled back to the bench where he had been sitting. Another cry
escaped him when he reached it. Throwing himself upon the
grass, he searched beneath the bench and explored the
ground about it. Then, his face blanched with fear, he rose
and traversed the entire park, questioning every occupant. The
gamins who had caused the accident had fled. The beggar, too,
had disappeared. The park was all but deserted. Returning
again to the bench, the priest sank upon it and buried his head
in his hands, groaning aloud. A few minutes later he abruptly
rose and, glancing furtively around as if he feared to be seen,
hastened out to the street. Then, darting into a narrow crossroad,
he disappeared in the direction of the Vatican.</p>
<p>At midnight, Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n was still pacing the floor
of his room, frantic with apprehension. At the same hour, the
small girl who had so unwittingly plunged him into the gravest
danger was safely asleep in her mother&rsquo;s arms on the night
express, which shrieked and thundered on its way to Lucerne.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_9' id='CHAPTER_9'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>
</div>
<p>Always as a child Jos&egrave; had been the tortured victim of a
vague, unformed apprehension of impending disaster, a
presentiment that some day a great evil would befall him.
The danger before which he now grew white with fear seemed to
realize that fatidic thought, and hang suspended above him on
a filament more tenuous than the hair which held aloft the
fabled sword of Damocles. That filament was the slender
chance that the notebook with which he was occupied when the
terrified child precipitated herself into the river, and which
he had hastily dropped on seeing her plight and rushing to the
rescue, had been picked up by those who would consider its
value <i>nil</i> as an instrument of either good or evil. Before the
accident occurred he had been absorbed in his writing and was
unaware of other occupants of the park than himself and the
children, whose boisterous romping in such close proximity had
scarce interrupted his occupation. Then their frightened cries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page59' name='book1_page59'></a>59</span>
roused him to an absorbing sense of the girl&rsquo;s danger. Nor
did he think again of the notebook until he was relating the
details of the accident to the guard at the edge of the park,
when, like a blow from above, the thought of it struck him.</p>
<p>Trembling with dread anticipation, he had hurried back to
the bench, only to find his fears realized. The book had disappeared!
His frenzied search yielded no hint of its probable
mode of removal. Overcome by a sickening sense of misfortune,
he had sunk upon the bench in despair. But fear again
roused him and drove him, slinking like a hunted beast, from
the park&ndash;&ndash;fear that the possessor of the book, appreciating its
contents, but with no thought of returning it, might be hovering
near, with the view of seeing what manner of priest it could
be who would thus carelessly leave such writings as these in
the public parks and within the very shadow of St. Peter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But to escape immediate identification as their author did
not remove his danger. Their character was such that, should
they fall into certain hands, his identity must surely be established.
Even though his name did not appear, they abounded
in references which could hardly fail to point to him. But, far
worse, they cited names of personages high in political and
ecclesiastical circles in references which, should they become
public, must inevitably set in motion forces whose far-reaching
and disastrous effects he dared not even imagine.</p>
<p>For the notebook contained the soul-history of the man. It
was the <i>journal intime</i> which he had begun as a youth, and continued
and amplified through succeeding years. It was the
repository of his inmost thoughts, the receptacle of his secret
convictions. It held, crystallized in writing, his earliest protests
against the circumstances which were molding his life.
It voiced the subsequent agonized outpourings of his soul when
the holy order of priesthood was conferred upon him. It recorded
his views of life, of religion, of the cosmos. It held in
burning words his thoughts anent the Holy Catholic faith&ndash;&ndash;his
sense of its virtues, its weaknesses, its assumptions, its fallacies.
It set forth his confession of helplessness before circumstances
too strong for his feeble will, and it cited therewith, as partial
justification for his conduct, his tender love for his mother and
his firm intention of keeping forever inviolable his promises
to her. It voiced his passionate prayers for light, and his dim
hopes for the future, while portraying the wreck of a life whose
elements had been too complex for him to sift and classify and
combine in their normal proportions.</p>
<p>A year had passed since the unhappy lad had opened his
mouth to receive the iron bit which Destiny had pressed so
mercilessly against it. During that time the Church had conscientiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page60' name='book1_page60'></a>60</span>
carried out her program as announced to him just
prior to his ordination. Associated with the Papal Legate, he
had traveled extensively through Europe, his impressionable
mind avidly absorbing the customs, languages, and thought-processes
of many lands. At Lourdes he had stood in deep
meditation before the miraculous shrine, surrounded with its
piles of discarded canes and crutches, and wondered what
could be the principle, human or divine, that had effected such
cures. In Naples he had witnessed the miraculous liquefaction
of the blood of St. Januarius. He had seen the priests pass
through the great assemblage with the little vial in which the
red clot slowly dissolved into liquid before their credulous
eyes; and he had turned away that they might not mark his
flush of shame. In the Cathedral at Cologne he had gazed long
at the supposed skulls of the three Magi who had worshipped
at the rude cradle of the Christ. Set in brilliant jewels, in a
resplendent gilded shrine, these whitened relics, which Bishop
Reinald is believed to have discovered in the twelfth century,
seemed to mock him in the very boldness of the pious fraud
which they externalized. Was the mystery of the Christ involved
in such deceit as this? And perpetrated by his Church?
In unhappy Ireland he had been forced to the conviction that
misdirected religious zeal must some day urge the sturdy Protesters
of the North into armed conflict with their Catholic
brothers of the South in another of those deplorable religious&ndash;&ndash;nay,
rather, <i>theological</i>&ndash;&ndash;conflicts which have stained the
earth with human blood in the name of the Prince of Peace.
It was all incomprehensible to him, incongruous, and damnably
wicked. Why could not they come together to submit their
creeds, their religious beliefs and tenets, to the test of practical
demonstration, and then discard those which world-history has
long since shown inimical to progress and happiness? Paul
urged this very thing when he wrote, &ldquo;<i>Prove</i> all things; hold
fast to that which is good.&rdquo; But, alas! the human doctrine of
infallibility now stood squarely in the way.</p>
<p>From his travels with the Legate, Jos&egrave; returned to Rome,
burning with the holy desire to lend his influence to the institution
of those reforms within the Church of which now he so
clearly saw the need. Savonarola had burned with this same
selfless desire to reform the Church from within. And his life
became the forfeit. But the present age was perforce more
tolerant; and was likewise wanting in those peculiar political
conditions which had combined with the religious issue to
send the great reformer to a martyr&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>As Jos&egrave; entered Rome he found the city in a state of turmoil.
The occasion was the march of the Catholic gymnastic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page61' name='book1_page61'></a>61</span>
associations from the church where they had heard the Mass
to St. Peter&rsquo;s, where they were to be received by the Holy
Father. Cries of &ldquo;Long live free-thinking!&rdquo; were issuing from
the rabble which followed hooting in the wake of the procession.
To these were retorted, &ldquo;Viva il Papa Re!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; had
been caught in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and, but for the interference of the
civil authorities, might have suffered bodily injury. With his
corporeal bruises he now bore away another ineffaceable mental
impression. Were the Italian patriots justified in their hostility
toward the Vatican? Had United Italy come into existence
with the support of the Papacy, or in despite of it? Would
the Church forever set herself against freedom of thought?
Always seek to imprison the human mind? Was her unreasonably
stubborn attitude directly accountable for the presence of
atheism in the place, of all places, where her own influence
ought to be most potent, the city of St. Peter?</p>
<p>For reasons which he could only surmise&ndash;&ndash;perhaps because
of his high scholarship&ndash;&ndash;perhaps because of his remarkable
memory, which constituted him a living encyclopedia in respect
of all that entered it&ndash;&ndash;Jos&egrave; was now installed in the office
of the Papal Secretary of State as an office assistant. He had
received the appointment with indifference, for he was wholly
devoid of ecclesiastical ambition. And yet it was with a sense
of relief that he now felt assured of a career in the service of
the Administrative Congregation of the Church, and for all
time removed from the likelihood of being relegated to the
performance of merely priestly functions. He therefore prepared
to bide his time, and patiently to await opportunities to
lend his willing support to the uplift of the Church and his
fellow-men.</p>
<p>The limitations with which he had always been hedged
about had not permitted the lad to know much, if anything, of
the multitude of books on religious and philosophical subjects
annually published throughout the world; and his oath of
obedience would have prevented him from reading them if he
had. But he saw no reason why, as part preparation for his
work of moral uplift, he should not continue to seek, at first
hand, the answer to the world-stirring query, What does the
Bible mean? If God gave it, if the theory of verbal inspiration
is correct, and if it is infallible, why then was it necessary to
revise it, as had been done in the wonderful Jerusalem Chamber
which he had once visited? Were those of his associates justified
who had scoffed at that work, and, with a sneer on their
lips, voiced the caustic query, &ldquo;Fools! Why don&rsquo;t they let the
Bible alone?&rdquo; If the world is to be instructed out of the old
sensual theology, does the Bible contain the truth with which to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page62' name='book1_page62'></a>62</span>
replace it? For to tear down an ideal without substituting for
it a better one is nothing short of criminal. And so Jos&egrave;
plunged deeply into the study of Scriptural sources.</p>
<p>He had thought the rich treasures of the Vatican library
unrestrictedly open to him, and he therefore brought his fine
Latin and Greek scholarship to bear on its oldest uncial manuscripts.
He began the study of Hebrew, that he might later
read the Talmud and the ancient Jewish rabbinical lore. He
pursued unflaggingly his studies of the English, French, and
German languages, that he might search for the truth crystallized
in those tongues. As his work progressed, the flush of
health came to his cheeks. His eyes reflected the consuming
fire which glowed in his eager soul. As he labored, he wrote;
and his discoveries and meditations all found lodgment in his
sole confidant, his journal.</p>
<p>If the Church knew what Christianity was, then Jos&egrave; was
forced to admit that he did not. He, weak, frail, fallible, <i>remit
sins</i>? Preposterous! What was the true remission of sins
but their utter destruction? He change the wafer and wine
into the flesh and blood of Jesus? Nay, he was no spiritual
thaumaturgus! He could not do even the least of the works of
the Master, despite his priestly character! Yet, it was not he,
but the Christ, operating through him as a channel, who performed
the work. Then why did not the Christ through him
heal the sick and raise the dead? &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he deplored, as he
bent over his task, &ldquo;the Church may teach that the bones, the
teeth, the hair, and other human relics of canonized Saints can
heal the sick&ndash;&ndash;but even the Cardinals and the Holy Father
when they fall ill demand the services, not of these, but of
earthly physicians. They seek not the Christ-healing then;
nor can they by their boasted powers heal themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s theme was: Righteousness is salvation. But Jos&egrave;
knew not how to define righteousness. Surely it did not mean
adherence to human creeds! It was vastly more than observance
of forms! &ldquo;God is a spirit,&rdquo; he read; &ldquo;and they that
worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&rdquo; Then,
voicing his own comments, &ldquo;Why, then, this crass materializing
of worship? Are images of Saviour, Virgin, and Saint necessary
to excite the people to devotion? Nay, would not the healing
of the sick, the restoration of sight to the blind, and the performance
of the works of the Master by us priests do more
than wooden or marble images to lead men to worship? Proof!
proof! proof! &lsquo;Show us your works, and we will show you our
faith,&rsquo; cry the people. &lsquo;Then will we no longer sacrifice our
independence of thought to the merciless tyranny of human
tradition.&rsquo;&rdquo; And he knew that this related to Catholic and
Protestant, Jew and Mohammedan alike.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page63' name='book1_page63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>One day a Cardinal, passing through the library, saw the
diligent student at work, and paused to inquire into his labors.
&ldquo;And what do you seek, my son?&rdquo; was the kindly query of the
aged churchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scriptural justification for the fundamental tenets of our
faith,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied quickly, carried away by his soul&rsquo;s animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you find it, without doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Father, except through what is, to me, unwarranted
license and assumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cardinal silently continued his way. But permission
to translate further from the Vatican manuscripts was that
day withdrawn from Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>Again the youth lapsed into his former habit of moody revery.
Shackled and restless, driven anew into himself, he increasingly
poured his turbulent thought into his journal, not for other
and profane eyes to read&ndash;&ndash;hardly, either, for his own reference&ndash;&ndash;but
simply because he <i>must</i> have some outlet for the expression
of his heaving mind. He turned to it, as he had in
other crises in his life, when his pent soul cried out for some
form of relief. He began to revise the record of the impressions
received on his travels with the Papal Legate. He recorded
conversations and impressions of scenes and people which his
abnormally developed reticence would not permit him to discuss
verbally with his associates. He embodied his protests
against the restrictions of ecclesiastical authority. And he
noted, too, many a protest against the political, rather than
religious, character of much of the business transacted in the
office to which he was attached. In the discharge of his ordinary
duties he necessarily became acquainted with much of
the inner administrative polity of the Vatican, and thus at
times he learned of policies which stirred his alien soul to
revolt. In his inferior position he could not hope to raise his
voice in protest against these measures which excited his indignation;
but in the loneliness of his room, or on his frequent
long walks after office hours, he was wont to brood over them
until his mind became surcharged and found relief only in
emptying itself into this journal. And often on summer days,
when the intense heat rendered his little room in the dormitory
uninhabitable, he would take his books and papers to some one
of the smaller parks lining the Tiber, and there would lose
himself in study and meditation and the recording of the
ceaseless voicing of his lonely soul.</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon, however, his mind had been
occupied with matters of more than ordinary import. It happened
that a Bishop from the United States had arrived in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page64' name='book1_page64'></a>64</span>
Rome the preceding day to pay his decennial visit to the Vatican
and report on the spiritual condition of his diocese. While
awaiting the return of the Papal Secretary, he had engaged in
earnest conversation with a Cardinal-Bishop of the Administrative
Congregation, in a small room adjoining the one where
Jos&egrave; was occupied with his clerical duties. The talk had been
animated, and the heavy tapestry at the door had not prevented
much of it from reaching the ears of the young priest and
becoming fixed in his retentive memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I feel most keenly the persecution to which the
Church must submit in the United States,&rdquo; the Bishop had
said, &ldquo;nevertheless Your Eminence will admit that there is
some ground for complaint in the conduct of certain of her
clergy. It is for the purpose of removing such vantage ground
from our critics that I again urge an investigation of American
priests, with the view of improving their moral status.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say, &lsquo;persecution to which the Church <i>must</i> submit.&rsquo;
Is that quite true?&rdquo; returned the Cardinal-Bishop. &ldquo;That is,
in the face of your own gratifying reports? News from the
American field is not only encouraging, but highly stimulating.
The statistics which are just at hand from Monsignor, our
Delegate in Washington, reveal the truly astonishing growth
of our beloved cause for the restoration of all things in Christ.
Has not God shown even in our beloved America that our way
of worshiping Him is the way He approves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Your Eminence, the constant defections! It was only
last week that a priest and his entire congregation went over
to the Episcopal faith. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that? &lsquo;It must needs be that offenses come.&rsquo;
Where one drops out, ten take his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, while we recruit our depleted ranks from the Old
World. But, with restricted immigration&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is not restricted, as yet,&rdquo; replied the Cardinal-Bishop
with a sapient smile. &ldquo;Nor is there any restriction upon
the inspiration, political as well as spiritual, which the American
Government draws from Rome&ndash;&ndash;an inspiration much more
potent, I think, than our Protestant brethren would care to
admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that inspiration such, think you, as to draw the American
Government more and more into the hands of the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its effect in the past unquestionably has been such,&rdquo; said
the Cardinal-Bishop meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall our dreams of an age be fulfilled&ndash;&ndash;that the Holy
Father will throw off the shackles which now hold him a
prisoner within the Vatican, and that he will then personally
direct the carrying out of those policies of world expansion
which shall gather all mankind into the fold of Holy Church?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page65' name='book1_page65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a lessening doubt of it,&rdquo; was the tentative reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the Bishop hesitated. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;shall we say that
those all-embracing policies ultimately will be directed by the
Holy Father from Washington itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long pause ensued, during which Jos&egrave; was all ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; finally returned the Cardinal-Bishop slowly.
&ldquo;Why not, if it should better suit our purposes? It may become
advisable to remove the Holy See from Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&ndash;&ndash;quite possible, though I will not say probable.
But let us see, can we not say that the time has arrived when
no President of the United States can be elected without the
Catholic vote? Having our vote, we have his pledges to support
our policies. These statistics before us show that already
seventy-five per cent of all Government employes in Washington
are of our faith. We control Federal, State, County and
City offices without number. I think&ndash;&ndash;I think the time is not
distant when we shall be able to set up a candidate of our
faith for the Presidency, if we care to. And,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;we
shall elect him. But, all in good time, all in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that,&rdquo; the Bishop interrogated eagerly, &ldquo;what the
Holy Father is now contemplating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say that it is,&rdquo; answered the noncommittal Cardinal-Bishop.
&ldquo;But the Holy Father loves America. He rejoices
in your report of progress in your diocese. The successes attained
by Catholic candidates in the recent elections are most
gratifying to him. This not only testifies to the progress of
Catholicism in America, but is tangible proof of the growth of
tolerance and liberal-mindedness in that great nation. The
fact that the Catholic Mass is now being said in the American
army affords further proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; meditated the Bishop. &ldquo;Our candidates who receive
election are quite generally loyal to the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And should constitute a most potent factor in the holy
work of making America dominantly Catholic,&rdquo; added the older
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Your Eminence. And yet, this great desideratum
can never come about until the youth are brought into the true
fold. And that means, as you well know, the abolishing of the
public school system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you of that?&rdquo; asked the Cardinal-Bishop off-handedly.</p>
<p>The Bishop waxed suddenly animated. A subject had been
broached which lay close to his heart. &ldquo;The public schools
constitute a godless sink of pollution!&rdquo; he replied heatedly.
&ldquo;They are nurseries of vice! They are part of an immoral and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page66' name='book1_page66'></a>66</span>
vicious system of education which is undermining the religion
of American children! I have always contended that we, the
Holy Catholic Church, <i>must</i> control education! I hold that
education outside of the Church is heresy of the most damnable
kind! We have heretofore weakly protested against this
pernicious system, but without success, excepting&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and here
he smiled cynically&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that we have very generally succeeded
in forcing the discontinuance of Bible reading in the public
schools. And in certain towns where our parochial schools do
not instruct beyond the eighth grade, it looks as if we might
force the introduction of a form of the Catholic Mass to be
read each morning in the High School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; exclaimed the Cardinal-Bishop. &ldquo;Your voice
thrills me like a trumpet call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would it were such,&rdquo; cried the Bishop excitedly, &ldquo;summoning
the faithful to strike a blow which shall be felt! What
right have the United States, or any nation, to educate the
young? None whatever! Education belongs to the Church!
Our rights in this respect have been usurped! But they shall
be restored&ndash;&ndash;if need be, at the point of the&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You positively make my old heart leap to the fray,&rdquo; interrupted
the smiling, white-haired churchman. &ldquo;But I feel
assured that we shall accomplish just that without violence or
bloodshed, my son. You echo my sentiments exactly on the
pregnant question. And yet, by getting Catholics employed in
the public schools as teachers, and by electing our candidates
to public offices, we quietly accomplish our ends, do we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when will the Holy Father recognize the time as propitious
for a more decisive step in that respect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my son, I think you fail to see that we keep continually
stepping. We are growing by leaps and bounds in
America. At the close of the War of Independence the United
States numbered some forty-five thousand adherents to the
Catholic faith. Now the number has increased to twelve or
fifteen millions. Of these, some four millions are voters. A
goodly number, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried the Bishop, &ldquo;let the Holy Father boldly make
the demand that the States appropriate money for the support
of our parochial schools!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s ears throbbed. Before his ordination he had heard
the Liturgy for the conversion of America recited in the chapel
of the seminary. And as often he had sought to picture the
condition of the New World under the religio-political influence
which has for centuries dominated the Old. But he had always
dismissed the idea of such domination as wholly improbable,
if not quite impossible in America. Yet, since coming into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page67' name='book1_page67'></a>67</span>
the Papal Secretary&rsquo;s office, his views were slowly undergoing
revision. The Church was concentrating on America. Of that
there could be no doubt. Indeed, he had come to believe its
success as a future world-power to be a function of the stand
which it could secure and maintain in the United States. Now,
as he strained his ears, he could hear the aged Cardinal-Bishop&rsquo;s
low, tense words&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no real separation of Church and State. The
Church is <i>not</i> inferior to the civil power, nor is it in any way
dependent upon it. And the Church can never be excluded
from educating and training the young, from molding society,
from making laws, and governing, temporally and spiritually.
From this attitude we shall <i>never</i> depart! Ours is the only
true religion. England and Germany have been spiritually
dead. But, praise to the blessed Virgin who has heard our
prayers and made intercession for us, England, after long
centuries of struggle with man-made sects and indefinite dogma,
its spiritually-starving people fast drifting into atheism and infidelity
because of nothing to hold to, has awakened, and in
these first hours of her resurrection is fast returning to the
Holy Church of Rome. America, in these latter days, is rousing
from the blight of Puritanism, Protestantism, and their inevitable
result, free-thinking and anarchy, and is becoming the
brightest jewel in the Papal crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop smiled dubiously. &ldquo;And yet, Your Eminence,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;we are heralded from one end of the land to the
other as a menace to Republican institutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, true. And you must agree that Romanism is a distinct
menace to the insane license of speech and press. It is a
decided menace to the insanity of Protestantism. But,&rdquo; he
added archly, while his eyes twinkled, &ldquo;I have no doubt that
when Catholic education has advanced a little further many
of your American preachers, editors, and Chautauqua demagogues
will find themselves behind the bars of madhouses.
Fortunately, that editor of the prominent American magazine
of which you were speaking switched from his heretic Episcopal
faith in time to avoid this unpleasant consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop reflected for a moment. Then, deliberately, as
if meditating the great import of his words, &ldquo;Your Eminence,
in view of our strength, and our impregnable position as God&rsquo;s
chosen, cannot the Holy Father insist that the United States
mails be barred against the infamous publications that so basely
vilify our Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thereby precipitate a revolution?&rdquo; It was the firm
voice of the Papal Secretary himself, who at that moment
entered the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page68' name='book1_page68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Monsignor,&rdquo; said the Bishop, as he rose and saluted
the newcomer, &ldquo;how much longer must we submit to the gross
injustice and indignities practiced upon us by non-believers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the infallible Holy Father directs,&rdquo; replied that
eminent personage. &ldquo;Obey him, as you would God himself,&rdquo;
the Secretary continued. &ldquo;And teach your flock to do likewise.
The ballot will do for us in America what armed resistance
never could. Listen, friend, my finger is on the religious pulse
of the world. Nowhere does this pulse beat as strongly as in
that part which we call the United States. For years I have
been watching the various contending forces in that country,
diligently and earnestly studying the elements acting and reacting
upon our Church there. I have come to the conclusion
that the success of Holy Church throughout the world depends
upon its advance in the United States during the next few
years. I have become an American enthusiast! The glorious
work of making America Catholic is so fraught with consequences
of vastest import that my blood surges with the enthusiasm
of an old Crusader! But there is much still to be done.
America is a field white for the harvest, almost unobstructed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; queried the Bishop, &ldquo;you do not reckon Protestantism
an obstruction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protestantism!&rdquo; the Secretary rejoined with a cynical
laugh. &ldquo;No, I reckon it as nothing. Protestantism in America
is decadent. It has split, divided, and disintegrated, until it is
scarcely recognizable. Its adherents are falling away in great
numbers. Its weak tenets and senile faith hold but comparatively
few and lukewarm supporters. It has degenerated into
a sort of social organization, with musicals, pink teas, and
church suppers as attractions. No, America is <i>bound</i> to be
classed as a Catholic nation&ndash;&ndash;and I expect to live to see it thus.
Our material and spiritual progress in the United States is
amazing, showing how nobly American Catholics have responded
to the Holy Father&rsquo;s appeal. New dioceses are springing
up everywhere. Churches are multiplying with astonishing
rapidity. The discouraging outlook in Europe is more, far
more, than counterbalanced by our wonderful progress in the
United States. We might say that the Vatican now rests upon
American backs, for the United States send more Peter&rsquo;s Pence
to Rome than all other Catholic countries together. We practically
control her polls and her press. America was discovered
by Christopher Columbus, a Catholic in the service of a Catholic
ruler. It is Catholic in essence, and it shall so be recognized!
The Holy Catholic Church always has been and always will be
the sole and <i>only</i> Christian authority. The Catholic religion
by rights ought to be, and ultimately shall be, the exclusively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page69' name='book1_page69'></a>69</span>
dominant religion of the world, and every other sort of worship
shall be banished&ndash;&ndash;interdicted&ndash;&ndash;destroyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while Jos&egrave; heard no more. His ears burned and his
brain throbbed. He had become conscious of but one all-absorbing
thought, the fact of his vassalage to a world-embracing
political system, working in the name of the Christ. Not
a new thought, by any means&ndash;&ndash;indeed an old one, often held&ndash;&ndash;but
now driven home to him most emphatically. He forgot his
clerical duties and sank into profound revery on his inconsistent
position in the office of the highest functionary of Holy
Church aside from the Supreme Pontiff himself.</p>
<p>He was aroused at length from his meditations by the departure
of the American Bishop. &ldquo;It is true, as you report,&rdquo;
the Papal Secretary was saying earnestly. &ldquo;America seems
rife with modernism. Free-masonry, socialism, and countless
other fads and religious superstitions are widely prevalent
there. Nor do I underestimate their strength and influence.
And yet, I fear them not. There are also certain freak religions,
philosophical beliefs, wrung from the simple teachings
of our blessed Saviour, the rapid spread of which at one time
did give me some concern. The Holy Father mentioned one
or two of them to-day, in reference to his contemplated encyclical
on modernism. But I now see that they are cults based
upon human personality; and with their leaders removed, the
fabrics will of themselves crumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took leave of the Bishop, and turned again to address the
Cardinal-Bishop within. &ldquo;A matter of the gravest import has
arisen,&rdquo; he began in a low voice; &ldquo;and one that may directly
affect our negotiations in regard to the support which the Holy
Father will need in case he issues a <i>pronunciamento</i> that
France, Spain, and Austria shall no longer exercise the right of
veto in papal elections. That rumor regarding Isabella&rsquo;s
daughter is again afloat. I have summoned Father Rafa&eacute;l de
Rinc&oacute;n to Rome to state what he knows. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He rose and
looked out through the door at Jos&egrave;, bending over his littered
desk. Then he went back, and resumed his conversation with
the Cardinal-Bishop, but in a tone so low that Jos&egrave; could catch
only disconnected scraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Colombia?&rdquo; he at length heard the Cardinal-Bishop
exclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the Secretary&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;And presumably at the
instigation of that busybody, Wenceslas Ortiz. Though what
concern he might have in the <i>Infanta</i> is to me incomprehensible&ndash;&ndash;assuming,
of course, that there is such a royal daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Colombia elects a President soon, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the eve of election now,&rdquo; replied the Secretary. &ldquo;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page70' name='book1_page70'></a>70</span>
if the influence of Wenceslas with the Bishop of Cartagena is
what I am almost forced to admit that it is, then the election
is in his hands. But, the <i>Infanta</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The sound of his voice
did not carry the rest of his words to Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s itching ears.</p>
<p>An hour later the Secretary and the Cardinal-Bishop came
out of the room and left the office together. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Secretary
was saying, &ldquo;in the case of Wenceslas it was &lsquo;pull and
percuniam&rsquo; that secured him his place. The Church did not
put him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cardinal-Bishop laughed genially. &ldquo;Then the Holy
Ghost was not consulted, I take it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Secretary grimly. &ldquo;And he has so complicated
the already delicate situation in Colombia that I fear
Congress will table the bill prohibiting Free-masonry. It is to
be deplored. Among all the Latin Republics none has been
more thoroughly Catholic than Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Holy Father&rsquo;s unpublished order regarding the sale
and distribution of Bibles loyally observed there?&rdquo; queried the
Cardinal-Bishop.</p>
<p>The door closed upon them and Jos&egrave; heard no more. His
day&rsquo;s duties ended, he went to his room to write and reflect.
But the intense afternoon heat again drove him forth to seek
what comfort he might near the river. With his notebook in
hand he went to the little park, as was his frequent wont. An
hour or so later, while he was jotting down his remembrance of
the conversation just overheard, together with his own caustic
and protesting opinions, his absorption was broken by the
strange child&rsquo;s accident. A few minutes later the notebook had
disappeared.</p>
<p>And now the thought of all this medley of personal material
and secret matters of Church polity falling into the hands of
those who might make capital of it, and thereby drag the
Rinc&oacute;n honor through the mire, cast the man prostrate in
the dust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
</div>
<p>Days passed&ndash;&ndash;days whose every dawn found the priest
staring in sleepless, wide-eyed terror at the ceiling above&ndash;&ndash;days
crowded with torturing apprehension and sickening
suggestion&ndash;&ndash;days when his knees quaked and his hands
shook when his superiors addressed him in the performance
of his customary duties. No mental picture was too frightful
or abhorrent for him to entertain as portraying a possible consequence
of the loss of his journal. He cowered in agony before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page71' name='book1_page71'></a>71</span>
these visions. He dared not seek the little park again.
He feared to show himself in the streets. He dreaded the short
walk from his dormitory to the Vatican. His life became a
sustained torture&ndash;&ndash;a consuming agony of uncertainty, interminable
suspense, fearful foreboding. The cruelty of his position
corroded him. His health suffered, and his cassock hung like a
bag about his emaciated form.</p>
<p>Then the filament snapped and the sword fell. On a dismal,
rainy morning, some two months after the incident in the
park, Jos&egrave; was summoned into the private office of the Papal
Secretary of State. As the priest entered the small room the
Secretary, sitting alone at his desk, turned and looked at him
long and fixedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my son,&rdquo; he said in a voice that froze the priest&rsquo;s blood,
&ldquo;you are still alive?&rdquo; Then, taking up a paper-covered book
of medium size which apparently he had been reading, he held
it out without comment.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; took it mechanically. The book was crudely printed
and showed evidence of having been hastily issued. It came
from the press of a Viennese publisher, and bore the startling
title, &ldquo;Confessions of a Roman Catholic Priest.&rdquo; As in a dream
Jos&egrave; opened it. A cry escaped him, and the book fell from his
hands. <i>It was his journal!</i></p>
<p>There are sometimes crises in human lives when the storm-spent
mind, tossing on the waves of heaving emotion, tugs and
strains at the ties which moor it to reason, until they snap,
and it sweeps out into the unknown, where blackness and
terror rage above the fathomless deep. Such a crisis had
entered the life of the unhappy priest, who now held in his
shaking hand the garbled publication of his life&rsquo;s most sacred
thoughts. Into whose hands his notes had fallen on that black
day when he had sacrificed everything for an unknown child,
he knew not. How they had made their way into Austria, and
into the pressroom of the heretical modernist who had gleefully
issued them, twisted, exaggerated, but unabridged, he might
not even imagine. The terrible fact remained that there in his
hands they stared up at him in hideous mockery, his soul-convictions,
his heart&rsquo;s deepest and most inviolable thoughts, details
of his own personal history, secrets of state&ndash;&ndash;all ruthlessly
exposed to the world&rsquo;s vulgar curiosity and the rapacity
of those who would not fail to play them up to the certain
advantages to which they lent themselves all too well.</p>
<p>And there before him, too, were the Secretary&rsquo;s sharp eyes,
burning into his very soul. He essayed to speak, to rise to his
own defense. But his throat filled, and the words which he
would utter died on his trembling lips. The room whirled about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page72' name='book1_page72'></a>72</span>
him. Floods of memory began to sweep over him in huge
billows. The conflicting forces which had culminated in placing
him in the paradoxical position in which he now stood
raced before him in confused review. Objects lost their definite
outlines and melted into the haze which rose before his straining
eyes. All things at last merged into the terrible presence
of the Papal Secretary, as he slowly rose, tall and gaunt, and
with arm extended and long, bony finger pointing to the yellow
river in the distance, said in words whose cruel suggestion
scorched the raw soul of the suffering priest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, be advised: the Tiber covers many sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then pitying oblivion opened wide her arms, and the tired
priest sank gently into them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>
</div>
<p>Rome again lay scorching beneath a merciless summer sun.
But the energetic uncle of Jos&egrave; was not thereby restrained
from making another hurried visit to the Vatican. What
his mission was does not appear in papal records; but, like the
one which he found occasion to make just prior to the ordination
of his nephew, this visit was not extended to include Jos&egrave;,
who throughout that enervating summer lay tossing in delirium
in the great hospital of the Santo Spirito. We may be
sure, however, that its influence upon the disposition of the
priest&rsquo;s case after the recent <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> was not inconsiderable,
and that it was largely responsible for his presence before the
Holy Father himself when, after weeks of racking fever, wan
and emaciated, and leaning upon the arm of the confidential
valet of His Holiness, the young priest faced that august personage
and heard the infallible judgment of the Holy See upon
his unfortunate conduct.</p>
<p>On the throne of St. Peter, in the heavily tapestried private
audience room of the great Vatican prison-palace, and guarded
from intrusion by armed soldiery and hosts of watchful ecclesiastics
of all grades, sat the Infallible Council, the Vicar-General
of the humble Nazarene, the aged leader at whose beck
a hundred million faithful followers bent in lowly genuflection.
Near him stood the Papal Secretary of State and two Cardinal-Bishops
of the Administrative Congregation.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; dragged himself wearily before the Supreme Pontiff
and bent low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Benedicite</i>, my erring son.&rdquo; The soft voice of His Holiness
floated not unmusically through the tense silence of the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page73' name='book1_page73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Arise. The hand of the Lord already has been laid heavily
upon you in wholesome chastening for your part in this deplorable
affair. And the same omnipotent hand has been
stretched forth to prevent the baneful effects of your thoughtless
conduct. We do not condemn you, my son. It was the
work of the Evil One, who has ever found through your weaknesses
easy access to your soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; raised his blurred eyes and gazed at the Holy Father
in perplexed astonishment. But the genial countenance of the
patriarch seemed to confirm his mild words. A smile, tender
and patronizing, in which Jos&egrave; read forgiveness&ndash;&ndash;and yet with
it a certain undefined something which augured conditions
upon which alone penalty for his culpability would be remitted&ndash;&ndash;lighted
up the pale features of the Holy Father and warmed
the frozen life-currents of the shrinking priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; the Pontiff continued tenderly, &ldquo;our love for our
wandering children is but stimulated by their need of our protecting
care. Fear not; the guilty publisher of your notes has
been awakened to his fault, and the book which he so thoughtlessly
issued has been quite suppressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; bent his head and patiently awaited the conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have lain for weeks at death&rsquo;s door, my son. The
words which you uttered in your delirium corroborated our
own thought of your innocence of intentional wrong. And
now that you have regained your reason, you will confess to us
that your reports, and especially your account of the recent
conversation between the Cardinal-Secretary of State and the
Cardinal-Bishop, were written under that depression of mind
which has long afflicted you, producing a form of mental derangement,
and giving rise to frequent hallucination. It is this
which has caused us to extend to you our sympathy and protection.
Long and intense study, family sorrow, and certain
inherited traits of disposition, whose rapid development have
tended to lack of normal mental balance, account to us for
those deeds of eccentricity on your part which have plunged
us into extreme embarrassment and yourself into the illness
which threatened your young life. Is it not so, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest stared up at the speaker in bewilderment. This
unexpected turn of affairs had swept his defense from his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Father awaits your reply,&rdquo; the Papal Secretary
spoke with severity. His own thought had been greatly ruffled
that morning, and his patience severely taxed by a threatened
mutiny among the Swiss guards, whose demands in regard to
the quantity of wine allowed them and whose memorial recounting
other alleged grievances he had just flatly rejected.
The muffled cries of &ldquo;<i>Viva Garibaldi!</i>&rdquo; as the petitioners left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page74' name='book1_page74'></a>74</span>
his presence were still echoing in the Secretary&rsquo;s ears, and his
anger had scarce begun to cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are patient, my Cardinal-Nephew,&rdquo; the Pontiff resumed
mildly. &ldquo;Our love for this erring son enfolds him.&rdquo; Then,
turning again to Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;We have correctly summarized the
causes of your recent conduct, have we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest made as if to reply, but hesitated, with the words
fluttering on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear son&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Holy Father bent toward the wondering
priest in an attitude of loving solicitation&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;our blessed Saviour
was ofttimes confronted with those possessed of demons. Did
he reject them? No; and, despite the accusations against us
in your writings, for which we know you were not morally
responsible, we, Christ&rsquo;s representative on earth, are still
touched with his love and pity for one so unfortunate as you.
With your help we shall stop the mouths of calumny, and set
you right before the world. We shall use our great resources
to save the Rinc&oacute;n honor which, through the working of Satan
within you, is now unjustly besmirched. We shall labor to
restore you to your right mind, and to the usefulness which
your scholarly gifts make possible to you. We indeed rejoice
that your piteous appeal has reached our ears. We rejoice
to correct those erroneous views which you, in the temporary
aberration of reason, were driven to commit to writing, and
which so unfortunately fell into the hands of Satan&rsquo;s alert
emissaries. Your ravings during these weeks of delirium shed
much light upon the obsessing thoughts which plunged you into
mild insanity. And they have stirred the immeasurable depths
of pity within us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Holy Father paused after this unwontedly long speech.
A dumb sense of stupefaction seemed to possess the priest, and
he passed his shrunken hands before his eyes as if he would
brush away a mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That this unfortunate book is but the uttering of delirium,
we have already announced to the world,&rdquo; His Holiness gently
continued. &ldquo;But out of our deep love for a family which has
supplied so many illustrious sons to our beloved Church we
have suppressed mention of your name in connection therewith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest started, as he vaguely sensed the impending
issue. What was it that His Holiness was about to demand?
That he denounce his journal, over his own signature, as the
ravings of a man temporarily insane? He was well aware
that the Vatican&rsquo;s mere denial of the allegations therein contained,
and its attributing of them to a mad priest, would
scarcely carry conviction to the Courts of Spain and Austria,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page75' name='book1_page75'></a>75</span>
or to an astonished world. But, for him to declare them the
garbled and unauthentic utterances of an aberrant mind, and
to make public such statement in his own name, would save
the situation, possibly the Rinc&oacute;n honor, even though it stultify
his own.</p>
<p>His Holiness waited a few moments for the priest&rsquo;s reply;
but receiving none, he continued with deep significance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not make it necessary, we know, for us to announce
that a mad priest, a son of the house of Rinc&oacute;n, now
confined in an asylum, voiced these heretical and treasonable
utterances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of His Holiness flowed like cadences of softest
music, charming in its tenderness, winning in its appeal, but
momentous in its certain implication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our solicitude for your recovery we commanded our
own physicians to attend you. To them you owe your life.
To them, too, we owe our gratitude for that report on your case
which reveals the true nature of the malady afflicting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The low voice vibrated in rhythmic waves through the dead
silence of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To them also you now owe this opportunity to abjure the
writings which have caused us and yourself such great sorrow;
to them you owe this privilege of confessing before us, who will
receive your recantation, remit your unintentional sins, and
restore you to honor and service in our beloved Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; suddenly came to himself. Recant! Confess! In
God&rsquo;s name, what? Abjure his writings, the convictions of a
lifetime!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These writings, my son, are not your sane and rational
convictions,&rdquo; the Pontiff suggested.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; still stood mute before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You renounce them now, in the clear light of restored
reason; and you swear future lealty to us and to Holy Church,&rdquo;
the aged Father continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make answer!&rdquo; commanded one of the Cardinal-Bishops,
starting toward the wavering priest. &ldquo;Down on your knees
before the Holy Father, who waits to forgive your venial sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned swiftly to the approaching Cardinal and held up
a hand. The man stopped short. The Pontiff and his associates
bent forward in eager anticipation. The valet fell back,
and Jos&egrave; stood alone. In that tense mental atmosphere the
shrinking priest seemed to be transformed into a Daniel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Holy Father, you mistake!&rdquo; His voice rang through
the room like a clarion. &ldquo;I do not recant! My writings <i>do</i>
express my deepest and sanest convictions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pontiff&rsquo;s pallid face went dark. The eyes of the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page76' name='book1_page76'></a>76</span>
auditors bulged with astonishment. A dumb spell settled over
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, my guilt lies not in having recorded my honest
convictions, nor in the fact that these records fell into the
hands of those who eagerly grasp every opportunity to attack
their common enemy, the Church. It lies rather in my weak
resistance to those influences which in early life combined to
force upon me a career to which I was by temperament and
instinct utterly disinclined. It lies in my having sacrificed
myself to the selfish love of my mother and my own exaggerated
sense of family pride. It lies in my still remaining outwardly
a priest of the Catholic faith, when every fiber of my soul
revolts against the hypocrisy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a subject of the Church!&rdquo; the Papal Secretary interrupted.
&ldquo;You have sworn to her and to the Sovereign Pontiff
as loyal and unquestioning obedience as to the will of God
himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned upon him. &ldquo;Before my ordination,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;I was a voluntary subject of the Sovereign of Spain. Did that
ceremony render me an unwilling subject of the Holy Father?
Does the ceremony of ordination constitute the Romanizing of
Spain? No, I am not a subject of Rome, but of my conscience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another dead pause followed, in which for some moments
nothing disturbed the oppressive silence. Jos&egrave; looked eagerly
into the delicate features of the living Head of the Church.
Then, with decreased ardor, and in a voice tinged with pathos,
he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, my mistakes have been only such as are natural
to one of my peculiar character. I came to know, but too late,
that my life-motives, though pure, found not in me the will
for their direction. I became a tool in the hands of those
stronger than myself. For what ultimate purpose, I know not.
Of this only am I certain, that my mother&rsquo;s ambitions, though
selfish, were the only pure motives among those which united
to force the order of priesthood upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force!&rdquo; burst in one of the Cardinal-Bishops. &ldquo;Do you
assume to make the Holy Father believe that the priesthood
can be <i>forced</i> upon a man? You assumed it willingly, gladly,
as was your proper return for the benefits which the Mother
Church had bestowed upon you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a state of utmost confusion, bordering a mental breakdown,
I assumed it&ndash;&ndash;outwardly,&rdquo; returned the priest sadly,
&ldquo;but my heart never ceased to reject it. Once ordained, however,
I sought in my feeble way to study the needs of the
Church, and prepare myself to assist in the inauguration of
reforms which I felt she must some day undertake.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page77' name='book1_page77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>The Pontiff&rsquo;s features twitched with ill-concealed irritation
at this confession; but before he could speak Jos&egrave; continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, and Cardinal-Princes of the Church, does not
the need of your people for truth wring your hearts? Turn
from your zealous dreams of world-conquest and see them,
steeped in ignorance and superstition, wretched with poverty,
war, and crime, extending their hands to you as their spiritual
leaders&ndash;&ndash;to you, Holy Father, who should be their Moses, to
smite the rock of error, that the living, saving truth may
gush out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, as if fearful of his own rushing thought. Then:
&ldquo;Is not the past fraught with lessons of deepest import to
us? Is not the Church being rejected by the nations of Europe
because of our intolerance, our oppression, our stubborn clinging
to broken idols and effete forms of faith? We are now
turning from the wreckage which the Church has wrought in
the Old World, and our eyes are upon America. But can we
deceive ourselves that free, liberty-loving America will bow
her neck to the mediaeval yoke which the Church would impose
upon her? Why, oh, why cannot we see the Church&rsquo;s
tremendous opportunities for good in this century, and yield
to that inevitable mental and moral progression which must
sweep her from her foundations, unless she conform to its
requirements and join in the movement toward universal emancipation!
Our people are taught from childhood to be led;
they are willing followers&ndash;&ndash;none more willing in the world!
But why lead them into the pit? Why muzzle them with fear,
oppress them with threats, fetter them with outworn dogma
and dead creed? Why continue to dazzle them with pagan
ceremonialism and oriental glamour, and then, our exactions
wrung from them, leave them to consume with disease and
decay with moral contagion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is mad with heresy!&rdquo; muttered the Pontiff, turning
to the Cardinal-Bishops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not I who is mad with heresy, but the Holy
Church, of which you are the spiritual Head!&rdquo; cried the priest,
his loud voice trembling with indignation and his frail body
swaying under his rapidly growing excitement. &ldquo;She is guilty
of the damnable heresy of concealing knowledge, of hiding
truth, of stifling honest questionings! She is guilty of grossest
intolerance, of deadliest hatred, of impurest motives&ndash;&ndash;she, the
self-constituted, self-endowed spiritual guide of mankind, arrogating
to herself infallibility, superiority, supreme authority&ndash;&ndash;yea,
the very voice of God himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest had now lost all sense of environment, and his
voice waxed louder as he continued:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page78' name='book1_page78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The conduct of the Church throughout the centuries has
made her the laughing-stock of history, an object of ridicule to
every man of education and sense! She is filled with superstition&ndash;&ndash;do
you not know it? She is permeated with pagan
idolatry, fetishism, and carnal-mindedness! She is pitiably
ignorant of the real teachings of the Christ! Her dogmas have
been formed by the subtle wits of Church theologians. They
are in this century as childish as her political and social
schemes are mischievous! Why have we formulated our doctrine
of purgatory? Why so solicitous about souls in purgatorial
torment, and yet so careless of them while still on earth?
Where is our justification for the doctrine of infallibility? Is
liberty to think the concession of God, or of the Holy Father?
Where, oh, where is the divine Christ in our system of theology?
Is he to be found in materialism, intolerance, the burning
of Bibles, in hatred of so-called heretics, and in worldly
practices? Are we not keeping the Christ in the sepulcher,
refusing to permit him to arise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speech soared into the impassioned energy of thundered
denunciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Holy Father, and Cardinal-Bishops, I <i>am</i> justified in
criticizing the Holy Catholic Church! And I am likewise justified
in condemning the Protestant Church! All have fallen
woefully short of the glory of God, and none obeys the simple
commands of the Christ. The Church throughout the world
has become secularized, and worship is but hollow consistency
in the strict performance of outward acts of devotion. Our religion
is but a hypocritical show of conformity. Our asylums,
our hospitals, our institutions of charity? Alas! they but evidence
our woeful shortcoming, and our persistent refusal to
rise into the strength of the healing, saving Christ, which would
render these obsolete institutions unnecessary in the world of
to-day! The Holy Catholic Church is but a human institution.
Its worldliness, its scheming, its political machinations, make
me shudder&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, madman!&rdquo; thundered one of the Cardinal-Bishops,
rushing upon the frail Jos&egrave; with such force as to fell him to the
floor. The Pontiff had risen, and sunk again into his chair.
The valet hurried to his assistance. The Papal Secretary, his
face contorted with rage, and his throat choking with the press
of words which he strove to utter, hastened to the door to summon
help. &ldquo;Remove this man!&rdquo; he commanded, pointing out
the prostrate form of Jos&egrave; to the two Swiss guards who had
responded to his call. &ldquo;Confine him! He is violent&ndash;&ndash;a raging
maniac!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days later, Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, having been pronounced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page79' name='book1_page79'></a>79</span>
by the Vatican physicians mentally deranged, as the
result of acute cerebral anaemia, was quietly conveyed to a
sequestered monastery at Palazzola.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Two summers came, and fled again before the chill winds
which blew from the Alban hills. Then one day Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s uncle
appeared at the monastery door with a written order from His
Holiness, effecting the priest&rsquo;s conditional release. Together
they journeyed at once to Seville, the uncle alert and energetic
as ever, showing but slight trace of time&rsquo;s devastating hand;
Jos&egrave;, the shadow of his former self physically, and his mind
clouded with the somber pall of melancholia.</p>
<p>Toward the close of a quiet summer, spent with his mother
in his boyhood home, Jos&egrave; received from his uncle&rsquo;s hand another
letter, bearing the papal insignia. It was evident that it
was not unexpected, for it found the priest with his effects
packed and ready for a considerable journey. A hurried farewell
to his mother, and the life-weary Jos&egrave;, combining innocence
and misery in exaggerated proportions, and still a vassal
of Rome, set out for the port of Cadiz. There, in company with
the Apostolic Delegate and Envoy Extraordinary to the Republic
of Colombia, he embarked on the West Indian trader
Sarnia, bound for Cartagena, in the New World.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>
</div>
<p>There is no region in the Western Hemisphere more invested
with the spirit of romance and adventure than
that strip of Caribbean coast stretching from the Cape of
Yucatan to the delta of the Orinoco and known as the Spanish
Main. No more superb setting could have been chosen for the
opening scenes of the New World drama. Skies of profoundest
blue&ndash;&ndash;the tropical sun flaming through massive clouds of vapor&ndash;&ndash;a
sea of exuberant color, foaming white over coral beaches&ndash;&ndash;waving
cocoa palms against a background of exotic verdure
marking a tortuous shore line, which now rises sheer and precipitous
from the water&rsquo;s edge to dizzy, snowcapped, cloud-hung
heights, now stretches away into vast reaches of oozy mangrove
bog and dank cinchona grove&ndash;&ndash;here flecked with stagnant lagoons
that teem with slimy, crawling life&ndash;&ndash;there flattened into
interminable, forest-covered plains and untrodden, primeval
wildernesses, impenetrable, defiant, alluring&ndash;&ndash;and all perennially
bathed in dazzling light, vivid color, and soft, fragrant
winds&ndash;&ndash;with everywhere redundant foliage&ndash;&ndash;humming, chattering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page80' name='book1_page80'></a>80</span>
screaming life&ndash;&ndash;profusion&ndash;&ndash;extravagance&ndash;&ndash;prodigality&ndash;&ndash;riotous
waste! Small wonder that when this enticing shore
was first revealed to the astonished <i>Conquistadores</i>, where
every form of Nature was wholly different from anything their
past experience afforded, they were childishly receptive to every
tale, however preposterous, of fountains of youth, of magical
lakes, or enchanted cities with mountains of gold in the depths
of the frowning jungle. They had come with their thought
attuned to enchantment; their minds were fallow to the incredible;
they were fresh from their conquest of the vast <i>Mare
Tenebrosum</i>, with its mysteries and terrors. At a single stroke
from the arm of the intrepid Genoese the mediaeval superstitions
which peopled the unknown seas had fallen like fetters
from these daring and adventurous souls. The slumbering
spirit of knight-errantry awoke suddenly within their breasts;
and when from their frail galleons they beheld with ravished
eyes this land of magic and alluring mystery which spread out
before them in such gorgeous panorama, they plunged into the
glittering waters with waving swords and pennants, with shouts
of praise and joy upon their lips, and inaugurated that series
of prodigious enterprise, extravagant deeds of hardihood, and
tremendous feats of prowess which still remain unsurpassed in
the annals of history for brilliancy, picturesqueness, and wealth
of incident.</p>
<p>With almost incredible rapidity and thoroughness the Spanish
arms spread over the New World, urged by the corroding
lust of gold and the sharp stimulus afforded by the mythical
quests which animated the simple minds of these hardy searchers
for the Golden Fleece. Neither trackless forests, withering
heat, miasmatic climate nor savage Indians could dampen their
ardor or check their search for riches and glory. They penetrated
everywhere, steel-clad and glittering, with lance and
helmet and streaming banner. Every nook, every promontory
of a thousand miles of coast was minutely searched; every
island was bounded; every towering mountain scaled. Even
those vast regions of New Granada which to-day are as unknown
as the least explored parts of darkest Africa became
the scenes of stirring adventure and brilliant exploit of these
daring crusaders of more than three centuries ago.</p>
<p>The real wonders yielded by this newly discovered land of
enchantment far exceeded the fabled Manoa or El Dorado of
mythical lore; and the adventurous expeditions that were first
incited by these chimeras soon changed into practical colonizing
and developing projects of real and permanent value.
Amazing discoveries were made of empires which had already
developed a state of civilization, mechanical, military, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page81' name='book1_page81'></a>81</span>
agricultural, which rivaled those of Europe. Natural resources
were revealed such as the Old World had not even guessed
were possible. Great rivers, vast fertile plains, huge veins of
gold and copper ore, inexhaustible timber, a wealth of every
material thing desired by man, could be had almost without
effort. Fortunate, indeed, was the Spanish <i>Conquistador</i> in the
possession of such immeasurable riches; fortunate, indeed, had
he possessed the wisdom to meet the supreme test of character
which this sudden accession of wealth and power was to bring!</p>
<p>With the opening of the vast treasure house flanked by the
Spanish Main came the Spaniard&rsquo;s supreme opportunity to
master the world. Soon in undisputed possession of the greater
part of the Western Hemisphere; with immeasurable wealth
flowing into his coffers; sustained by dauntless courage and an
intrepid spirit of adventure; with papal support, and the learning
and genius of the centuries at his command, he faced the
opportunity to extend his sway over the entire world and unite
all peoples into a universal empire, both temporal and spiritual.
That he failed to rise to this possibility was not due to any lack
of appreciation of his tremendous opportunity, nor to a dearth
of leaders of real military genius, but to a misapprehension of
the great truth that the conquest of the world is not to be
wrought by feats of arms, but by the exercise of those moral
attributes and spiritual qualities of heart and soul which he
did not possess&ndash;&ndash;or possessing, had prostituted to the carnal
influences of lust of material riches and temporal power.</p>
<p>In the immediate wake of the Spanish <i>Conqueros</i> surged
the drift and flotsam of the Old World. Cities soon sprang up
along the Spanish Main which reflected a curious blend of the
old-time life of Seville and Madrid with the picturesque and
turbulent elements of the adventurer and buccaneer. The
spirit of the West has always been synonymous with a larger
sense of freedom, a shaking off of prejudice and tradition and
the trammels of convention. The sixteenth century towns of
the New World were no exception, and their streets and <i>plazas</i>
early exhibited a multicolored panorama, wherein freely mingled
knight and predaceous priest, swashbuckler and staid
<i>hidalgo</i>, timid Indian and veiled <i>doncella</i>&ndash;&ndash;a potpourri of merchant,
prelate, negro, thief, the broken in fortune and the blackened
in character&ndash;&ndash;all poured into the melting pot of the new
West, and there steaming and straining, scheming and plotting,
attuned to any pitch of venturesome project, so be it that gold
and fame were the promised emoluments thereof.</p>
<p>And gold, and fame of a certain kind, were always to be had
by those whose ethical code permitted of a little straining. For
the great ships which carried the vast wealth of this new land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page82' name='book1_page82'></a>82</span>
of magic back to the perennially empty coffers of Old Spain
constituted a temptation far more readily recognized than resisted.
These huge, slow-moving galleons, gilded and carved,
crawling lazily over the surface of the bright tropical sea, and
often so heavily freighted with treasure as to be unsafe in rough
weather, came to be regarded as special dispensations of Providence
by the cattle thieves and driers of beef who dwelt in the
pirates&rsquo; paradise of Tortuga and Hispaniola, and little was
required in way of soul-alchemy to transform the <i>boucanier</i>
into the lawless and sanguinary, though picturesque, corsair of
that romantic age. The buccaneer was but a natural evolution
from the peculiar conditions then obtaining. Where human
society in the process of formation has not yet arrived at the
necessity of law to restrain the lust and greed of its members;
and where at the same time untold wealth is to be had at the
slight cost of a few lives; and, too, where even the children are
taught that whosoever aids in the destruction of Spanish ships
and Spanish lives renders a service to the Almighty, the buccaneer
must be regarded as the logical result. He multiplied with
astonishing rapidity in these warm, southern waters, and not a
ship that sailed the Caribbean was safe from his sudden depredations.
So extensive and thorough was his work that the bed
of the Spanish Main is dotted with traditional treasure ships,
and to this day remnants of doubloons or &ldquo;pieces of eight&rdquo; and
bits of bullion and jewelry are washed up on the shining
beaches of Panam&aacute; and northern Colombia as grim memorials
of his lawless activities.</p>
<p>The expenditure of energy necessary to transport the gold,
silver and precious stones from the New World to the bottomless
treasury of Spain was stupendous. Yet not less stupendous
was the amount of treasure transported. From the distant
mines of Potosi, from the Pilcomayo, from the almost inaccessible
fastnesses of what are now Bolivia and Ecuador, a precious
stream poured into the leaking treasure box of Spain that
totalled a value of no less than ten billion dollars. Much of
the wealth which came from Peru was shipped up to the isthmus
of Panam&aacute;, and thence transferred to plate-fleets. But the
buccaneers became so active along the Pacific coast that water
shipment was finally abandoned, and from that time transportation
had to be made overland by way of the Andean
plateau, sometimes a distance of two thousand miles, to the
strongholds which were built to receive and protect the treasure
until the plate-fleets could be made up. Of these strongholds
there were two of the first importance, the old city of Panam&aacute;,
on the isthmus, and the almost equally old city of Cartagena,
on the northern coast of what is now the Republic of Colombia.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page83' name='book1_page83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>The spirit of ancient Carthage must have breathed upon this
&ldquo;Very Royal and Loyal City&rdquo; which Pedro de Heredia in the
sixteenth century founded on the north coast of New Granada,
and bequeathed to it a portion of its own romance and tragedy.
Superbly placed upon a narrow, tongue-shaped islet, one of a
group that shield an ample harbor from the sharp tropical
storms which burst unheralded over the sea without; girdled
by huge, battlemented walls, and guarded by frowning fortresses,
Cartagena commanded the gateway to the exhaustless
wealth of the <i>Cordilleras</i>, at whose feet she still nestles, bathed
in perpetual sunshine, and kissed by cool ocean breezes which
temper the winds blowing hot from the steaming <i>llanos</i> of the
interior. By the middle of the sixteenth century she offered
all that the adventurous seeker of fame and fortune could
desire, and attracted to herself not only the chivalry, but the
beauty, wealth and learning which, mingled with rougher elements,
poured into the New World so freely in the opening
scenes of the great drama inaugurated by the arrival of the
tiny caravels of Columbus a half century before.</p>
<p>The city waxed quickly rich and powerful. Its natural advantages
of location, together with its massive fortifications,
and its wonderful harbor, so extensive that the combined
fleets of Spain might readily have found anchorage
therein, early rendered it the choice of the Spanish monarch
as his most dependable reservoir and shipping point for the
accumulated treasure of his new possessions. The island upon
which the city arose was singularly well chosen for defense.
Fortified bridges were built to connect it with the mainland,
and subterranean passageways led from the great walls encircling
it to the impregnable fortress of San Felipe de Barajas,
on Mount San L&aacute;zaro, a few hundred yards back of the city and
commanding the avenues and approaches of the land side. To
the east, and about a mile from the walls, the abrupt hill of
La Popa rises, surmounted by the convent of Santa Candelaria,
likewise connected by underground tunnels to the interior of
the city, and commanding the harbor and its approaches from
the sea. The harbor formerly connected with the open sea
through two entrances, the Boca Grande, a wide, fortified pass
between the island of Tierra Bomba and the tongue on which
the city stands, and the Boca Chica, some nine miles farther
west, a narrow, tortuous pass, wide enough to permit entry to
but a single vessel at a time, and commanded by forts San
Fernando and San Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>By the middle of the seventeenth century Cartagena, &ldquo;Queen
of the Indies and Queen of the Seas,&rdquo; had expanded into a proud
and beautiful city, the most important mart of the New World.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page84' name='book1_page84'></a>84</span>
Under royal patronage its merchants enjoyed a monopoly of
commerce with Spain. Under the special favor of Rome it
became an episcopal See, and the seat of the Holy Inquisition.
Its docks and warehouses, its great centers of commerce, its
sumptuous dwellings, its magnificent Cathedral, its colleges and
monasteries, and its proud aristocracy, all reflected the spirit of
enterprise which animated its sons and found expression in a
city which could boast a pride, a culture, and a wealth almost
unrivalled even in the Old World.</p>
<p>But, not unlike her ancient prototype, Cartagena succumbed
to the very influences which had made her great. Her wealth
excited the cupidity of freebooters, and her power aroused the
jealousy of her formidable rivals. Her religion itself became
an excuse for the plundering hands of Spain&rsquo;s enemies. Again
and again the city was called upon to defend the challenge
which her riches and massive walls perpetually issued. Again
and again she was forced to yield to the heavy tributes and disgraceful
penalties of buccaneers and legalized pirates who, like
Drake, came to plunder her under royal patent. Cartagena
rose and fell, and rose again. But the human heart which
throbs beneath the lash of lust or revenge knows no barriers.
Her great forts availed nothing against the lawless hordes
which swarmed over them. Neither were her tremendous walls
proof against starvation. Again and again, her streets filled
with her gaunt dead, she stubbornly held her gates against the
enemies of Spain who assaulted her in the name of religion,
only at last to weaken with terror and throw them open in
disgraceful welcome to the French de Pontis and his maudlin,
rag-tag followers, who drained her of her last drop of life blood.
As her gates swung wide and this nondescript band of marauders
streamed in with curses and shouts of exultation, the
glory of this royal mediaeval city passed out forever.</p>
<p>Almost from its inception, Cartagena had been the point of
attack of every enterprise launched with the object of wresting
from Spain her rich western possessions, so much coveted by
her jealous and revengeful rivals. It was Spain herself who
fought for very existence while Cartagena was holding her
gates against the enemies of Holy Church. And these enemies
knew that they had pierced the Spanish heart when the &ldquo;Queen
of the Indies&rdquo; fell. And in no small measure did Spain deserve
the fate which overtook her. For, had it not been for the
stupendous amount of treasure derived from these new possessions,
the dramatic and dominant part which she played in the
affairs of Europe during the sixteenth century would have been
impossible. This treasure she wrested from her South American
colonies at a cost in the destruction of human life, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page85' name='book1_page85'></a>85</span>
outraging of human instincts, in the debauching of ideals and
the falsifying of hope, in hellish oppression and ghastly torture,
that can never be adequately estimated. Her benevolent instruments
of colonization were cannon and saintly relics. Her
agents were swaggering soldiers and bigoted friars. Her system
involved the impression of her language and her undemonstrable
religious beliefs upon the harmless aborigines. The
fruits of this system, which still linger after three centuries,
are superstition, black ignorance, and woeful mental retardation.
To the terrified aborigines the boasted Spanish civilization
meant little more than &ldquo;gold, liquor, and sadness.&rdquo; Small
wonder that the simple Indians, unable to comprehend the
Christian&rsquo;s lust for gold, poured the molten metal down the
throats of their captives, crying, &ldquo;Eat, Christian, eat!&rdquo; They
had borrowed their ideals from the Christian Spaniards, who
by means of the stake and rack were convincing them that God
was not in this western land until they came, bringing their
debauched concept of Christianity.</p>
<p>And so Cartagena fell, late in the seventeenth century, never
to regain more than a shadow of her former grandeur and
prestige. But again she rose, in a semblance of her martial
spirit, when her native sons, gathering fresh courage and inspiration
from the waning powers of the mother-country in the
early years of the century just closed, organized that federation
which, after long years of almost hopeless struggle, lifted the
yoke of Spanish misrule from New Granada and proclaimed the
Republic of Colombia. Cartagena was the first city of Colombia
to declare its independence from Spain. And in the
great war which followed the &ldquo;Heroic City&rdquo; passed through
terrible vicissitudes, emerging from it still further depleted
and sunken, a shell of massive walls and battered defenses,
with desolated homes and empty streets echoing the tread of
the mendicant <i>peon</i>.</p>
<p>As the nineteenth century, so rich in invention, discovery,
and stirring activity in the great States to the north, drew to a
close, a chance visitor to this battle-scarred, mediaeval city
would have found her asleep amid the dreams of her former
greatness. Approaching from the harbor, especially if he arrived
in the early hours of morning, his eyes would have met a
view of exquisite beauty. Seen thus, great moss-grown structures
rise from within the lofty encircling walls, with many a
tower and gilded dome glittering in the clear sunlight and
standing out in sharp relief against the green background of
forest-plumed hills and towering mountains. The abysmal
blue of the untainted tropical sky overhead contrasts sharply
with the red-tiled roofs and dazzling white exteriors of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page86' name='book1_page86'></a>86</span>
buildings beneath; and the vivid tints, mingling with the iridescence
of the scarcely rippling waters of the harbor, blend
into a color scheme of rarest loveliness in the clear atmosphere
which seems to magnify all distant objects and intensify every
hue.</p>
<p>A closer approach to the citadel which lies within the landlocked
harbor reveals in detail the features of the stupendous
walls which guard this key to Spain&rsquo;s former treasure house.
Their immensity and their marvelous construction bear witness
to the genius of her famous military engineers, and evoke the
same admiration as do the great temples and monuments of
ancient Egypt. These grim walls, in places sixty feet through,
and pierced by numerous gates, are frequently widened into
broad esplanades, and set here and there with bastions and
watch towers to command strategic points. At the north end
of the city they expand into an elaborately fortified citadel,
within which are enormous fresh water tanks, formerly supplied
by the rains, and made necessary by the absence of
springs so near the coast. Within the walls at various points
one finds the now abandoned barracks, storerooms, and echoing
dungeons, the latter in the days of the stirring past too often
pressed into service by the Holy Inquisition. Underground
tunnels, still intact, lead from the walls to the Cathedral, the
crumbling fortress of San Felipe de Barajas, and the deserted
convent on the summit of La Popa. Time-defying, grim, dramatic
reliques of an age forever past, breathing poetry and
romance from every crevice&ndash;&ndash;still in fancy echoing from moldering
tower and scarred bulwark the clank of sabre, the tread
of armored steed, and the shouts of exulting <i>Conquistadores</i>&ndash;&ndash;aye,
their ghostly echoes sinking in the fragrant air of night
into soft whispers, which bear to the tropical moon dark hints
of ancient tragedies enacted within these dim keeps and gloom-shrouded
tunnels!</p>
<p>The pass of Boca Grande&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;large mouth&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;through which
Drake&rsquo;s band of marauders sailed triumphantly in the latter
part of the sixteenth century, was formerly the usual entrance
to the city&rsquo;s magnificent harbor. But its wide, deep channel,
only two miles from the city walls, afforded too easy access to
undesirable visitors in the heyday of freebooters; and the
harassed Cartagenians, wearied of the innumerable piratical
attacks which this broad entrance constantly invited, undertook
to fill it up. This they accomplished after years of heroic
effort and an enormous expenditure of money, leaving the harbor
only the slender, tortuous entrance of Boca Chica&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;little
mouth&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;dangerous to incoming vessels because of the almost
torrential flow of the tide through it, but much more readily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page87' name='book1_page87'></a>87</span>
defended. The two castles of San Fernando and San Jos&egrave;,
frowning structures of stone dominating this entrance, have
long since fallen into disuse, but are still admirably preserved.
Beneath the former, and extending far below the surface of the
water, is the old Bastile of the Inquisition, occasionally pressed
into requisition now to house recalcitrant politicians, and where
no great effort of the imagination is required still to hear the
groans of the tortured and the sighs of the condemned, awaiting
in chains and <i>san benitos</i> the approaching <i>auto da f&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>But the greater distance from the present entrance of the
harbor to the city walls affords the visitor a longer period in
which to enjoy the charming panorama which seems to drift
slowly out to meet him as he stands entranced before it. The
spell of romance and chivalry is upon him long ere he disembarks;
and once through the great gateway of the citadel itself,
he yields easily to the ineluctable charm which seems to hover
in the balmy air of this once proud city. Everywhere are evidences
of ancient grandeur, mingling with memories of enormous
wealth and violent scenes of strife. The narrow, winding
streets, characteristic of oriental cities; the Moorish architecture
displayed in the grandiose palaces and churches; the
grated, unglazed windows, through which still peep timid
<i>se&ntilde;oritas</i>, as in the romantic days of yore; the gaily painted
balconies, over which bepowdered <i>doncellas</i> lean to pass the
day&rsquo;s gossip in the liquid tongue of Cervantes, all transport one
in thought to the chivalrous past, when this picturesque survival
of Spain&rsquo;s power in America was indeed the very Queen
of the western world and the proud boast of the haughty
monarchs of Castile.</p>
<p>Nor was the city more dear to the Spanish King than to the
spiritual Sovereign who sat on Peter&rsquo;s throne. The Holy See
strove to make Cartagena the chief ecclesiastical center of the
New World; and churches, monasteries, colleges, and convents
flourished there as luxuriantly as the tropical vegetation. The
city was early elevated to a bishopric. A magnificent Cathedral
was soon erected, followed by other churches and buildings to
house ecclesiastical orders, including the Jesuit college, the
University, the women&rsquo;s seminary, and the homes for religious
orders of both sexes. The same lavish expenditure of labor
and wealth was bestowed upon the religious structures as on
the walls and fortifications. The Cathedral and the church of
San Juan de Dios, the latter the most conspicuous structure in
the city, with its double towers and its immense monastery
adjoining, became the special recipients of the liberal outpourings
of a community rich not only in material wealth, but in
culture and refinement as well. The latter church in particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page88' name='book1_page88'></a>88</span>
was the object of veneration of the patrons of America&rsquo;s only
Saint, the beneficent Pedro Claver, whose whitened bones now
repose in a wonderful glass coffin bound with strips of gold
beneath its magnificent marble altar. In the central <i>plaza</i> of
the city still stands the building erected to house the Holy
Inquisition, so well preserved that it yet serves as a dwelling.
Adjacent to it, and lining the <i>plaza</i>, are spacious colonial edifices,
once the homes of wealth and culture, each shaded by
graceful palms and each enclosing its inner garden, or patio,
where tropical plants and aromatic shrubs riot in richest color
and fragrance throughout the year.</p>
<p>In the halcyon days of Cartagena&rsquo;s greatness, when, under
the protection of the powerful mother-country, her commerce
extended to the confines of the known world, her streets and
markets presented a scene of industry and activity wholly foreign
to her in these latter days of her decadence. From her
port the rich traffic which once centered in this thriving city
moved, in constantly swelling volume, in every direction. In
her marts were formulated those audacious plans which later
took shape in ever-memorable expeditions up the Magdalena
and Cauca rivers in search of gold, or to establish new colonies
and extend the city&rsquo;s sphere of influence. From her gates were
launched those projects which had for their object the discovery
of the mysterious regions where rivers were said to flow over
sands of pure gold and silver, or the kingdom of El Dorado,
where native potentates sprinkled their bodies with gold dust
before bathing in the streams sacred to their deities. From
this city the bold Quesada set out on the exploits of discovery
and conquest which opened to the world the rich plateau of
Bogot&aacute;, and ranked him among the greatest of the <i>Conquistadores</i>.
In those days a canal had been cut through the swamps
and dense coast lowlands to the majestic Magdalena river,
some sixty-five miles distant, where a riverine town was founded
and given the name of Calamar, the name Pedro de Heredia
had first bestowed upon Cartagena. Through this <i>dique</i> the
city&rsquo;s merchant vessels passed to the great arterial stream beyond,
and thence some thousand miles south into the heart of the
rich and little known regions of upper Colombia. To-day, like
the grass-grown streets of the ancient city, this canal, choked
with weeds and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, is but a green and turbid pool, but
yet a reminder of the faded glory of the famous old town which
played such a dramatic <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in that age of desperate courage.</p>
<p>In the finished town of Cartagena Spain&rsquo;s dreams of imperial
pomp and magnificence were externalized. In her history the
tragedy of the New World drama has been preserved. To-day,
sunk in decadence, surrounded by the old mediaeval flavor, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page89' name='book1_page89'></a>89</span>
steeped in the romance of an age of chivalry forever past, her
muniments and donjons, her gray, crenelated walls and time-defying
structures continue to express that dogged tenacity of
belief and stern defiance of unorthodox opinion which for
two hundred years maintained the Inquisition within her gates
and sacrificed her fair sons and daughters to an undemonstrable
creed. The heavy air of ecclesiasticism still hangs
over her. The priests and monks who accompanied every
sanguinary expedition of the <i>Conquistadores</i>, ready at all times
to absolve any desperado who might slay a harmless Indian
in the name of Christ, have their successors to-day in the astute
and untiring sons of Rome, who conserve the interests of Holy
Church within these battered walls and guard their portals
against the entrance of radical thought. Heredia had scarcely
founded the city when King Philip sent it a Bishop. And less
than a decade later the Cathedral, which to-day stands as the
center of the episcopal See, was begun.</p>
<p>The Cathedral, though less imposing than the church of San
Juan de Dios, is a fine example of the ecclesiastical architecture
of the colonial era. Occupying a central position in the city, its
ever-open doors invite rich and poor alike, citizen and stranger,
to enter and linger in the refreshing atmosphere within, where
the subdued light and cool shadows of the great nave and chapels
afford a grateful respite from the glare and heat of the streets
without. Massive in exterior appearance, and not beautiful
within, the Cathedral nevertheless exhibits a construction which
is at once broad, simple and harmonious. The nave is more
than usually wide between its main piers, and its rounded
arches are lofty and well proportioned. Excellent portraits of
former Bishops adorn its white walls, and narrow rectangular
windows at frequent intervals admit a dim, mellow light
through their dark panes. Before one of these windows&ndash;&ndash;apparently
with no thought of incongruity in the exhibition of
such a gruesome object attached to a Christian church&ndash;&ndash;there
has been affixed an iron grating, said to have served the Holy
Inquisition as a gridiron on which to roast its heretical victims.
Within, an ambulatory, supported on the first tier of arches,
affords a walk along either side of the nave, and leads to the
winding stairway of the bell tower. At one end of this ambulatory,
its entrance commanding a full view of the nave and the
<i>capilla mayor</i>, with its exquisitely carved marble altar, is located
the Bishop&rsquo;s <i>sanctum</i>. It was here that the young Spanish
priest, Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, stood before the Bishop of Cartagena on
the certain midday to which reference was made in the opening
chapter of this recital, and received with dull ears the ecclesiastical
order which removed him still farther from the world and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page90' name='book1_page90'></a>90</span>
doomed him to a living burial in the crumbling town of Simit&iacute;,
in the wilderness of forgotten Guamoc&oacute;.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last, you come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The querulous tones of the aged Bishop eddied the
brooding silence within the Cathedral. Without waiting
for a reply he turned again to his table and took up a paper
containing a list of names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait until midday,&rdquo; he continued testily; &ldquo;but you give
me time to reflect and decide. The parish of Simit&iacute; has long
been vacant. I have assigned you to it. The Honda touches at
Calamar to-morrow, going up-river. You will take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;! Father&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>; and would you dispute this too!&rdquo; quavered the ill-humored
Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;you surely cannot mean&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop turned sharply around. &ldquo;I mean that after what
I learn from Rome I will not keep you here to teach your heresies
in our University! I mean that after what I hear this
morning of your evil practices I will not allow you to spend
another day in Cartagena!&rdquo; The angry ecclesiastic brought his
bony fist hard against the table to emphasize the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i>&rdquo; he resumed, after some moments of nursing
his choleric feelings. &ldquo;Would you debate further! The
Holy Father for some unexplained reason inflicts a madman
upon me! And I, innocent of what you are, obey his instructions
and place you in the University&ndash;&ndash;with what result? You
have the effrontery&ndash;&ndash;the madness&ndash;&ndash;to lecture to your classes
on the heresies of Rome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as if that were not burden enough for these old
shoulders, I must learn that I have taken a serpent to my bosom&ndash;&ndash;but
that you are still sane enough to propagate heresies&ndash;&ndash;to
plot revolution with the Radicals&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;shame consume you!&ndash;&ndash;to
wantonly ruin the fair daughters of our diocese! But, do
you see now why I send you where you can do less evil than
here in Cartagena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest slowly petrified under the tirade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fault is not mine if I must act without instruction from
Rome,&rdquo; the Bishop went on petulantly. &ldquo;Twice have I warned
you against your teachings&ndash;&ndash;but I did not suspect then, for only
yesterday did I learn that before coming to me you had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page91' name='book1_page91'></a>91</span>
confined in a monastery&ndash;&ndash;insane! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre</i>! when you
bring the blush of shame to my cheeks because of your godless
practices&ndash;&ndash;it is time to put you away without waiting for instruction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Godless practices! Was the Bishop or the priest going mad?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go now to your room,&rdquo; the Bishop added, turning again to
his table. &ldquo;You have little enough time to prepare for your
journey. Wenceslas will give you letters to the Alcalde of
Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas! The priest&rsquo;s thought flew back over the events
of the morning. Marcelena&ndash;&ndash;Maria&ndash;&ndash;the encounter below with&ndash;&ndash;!
<i>Dios!</i> Could it be that Wenceslas had fastened upon him
the stigma of his own crime? The priest found his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&ndash;&ndash;it is untrue!&ndash;&ndash;these charges are false as hell!&rdquo;
he exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;I demand to know who brings them
against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The testy Bishop&rsquo;s wrath flared up anew. &ldquo;You demand!
Am I to sit here and be catechised by <i>you</i>? It is enough that I
know what occurs in my diocese, and am well informed of your
conduct!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorway darkened, and the priest turned to meet the
object of his suspecting thought.</p>
<p>Bestowing a smile of patronage upon Jos&egrave;, and bowing obsequiously
before the Bishop, Wenceslas laid some papers upon
the table, remarking as he did so, &ldquo;The letters, Your Grace, to
introduce our Jos&egrave; to his new field. Also his instructions and
expense money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wenceslas!&rdquo; The priest confronted him fiercely. &ldquo;Do
you accuse me before the Bishop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accuse, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo; Wenceslas queried in a tone of assumed
surprise. &ldquo;Have I not said that your ready tongue and pen are
your accusers? But,&rdquo; with a conciliatory air, &ldquo;we must remember
that our good Bishop mercifully views your conduct in the
light of your recent mental affliction, traces of which, unfortunately,
have lingered to cause him sorrow. And so he graciously
prepares a place for you, <i>caro amigo</i>, where rest and
relief from the strain of teaching will do you much good, and
where life among simple and affectionate people will restore
you, he hopes, to soundness of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest turned again to the Bishop in a complexity of
appeal. The soft speech of Wenceslas, so full of a double <i>entendu</i>,
so markedly in contrast with the Bishop&rsquo;s harsh but at
least sincere tirade, left no doubt in his mind that he was now
the victim of a plot, whose ramifications extended back to the
confused circumstances of his early life, and the doubtful purposes
of his uncle and his influence upon the sacerdotal directors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page92' name='book1_page92'></a>92</span>
in Rome. And he saw himself a helpless and hopelessly
entangled victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; In piteous appeal Jos&egrave; held out his hands to the
Bishop, who had turned his back upon him and was busy with
the papers on his table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>, the interview is ended,&rdquo; said Wenceslas quietly,
stepping between the priest and his superior.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; pushed wildly past the large form of Wenceslas and
seized the Bishop&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santa Maria!</i>&rdquo; cried the petulant churchman. &ldquo;Do you
obey me, or no? If not, then leave the Church&ndash;&ndash;and spend your
remaining days as a hounded ex-priest and unfrocked apostate,&rdquo;
he finished significantly. &ldquo;Go, prepare for your journey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas slipped the letter and a few <i>pesos</i> into the hand of
the smitten, bewildered Jos&egrave;, and turning him to the door,
gently urged him out and closed it after him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Just why the monastery gates had opened to him after two
years&rsquo; deadening confinement, Jos&egrave; had not been apprised. All
he knew was that his uncle had appeared with a papal appointment
for him to the University of Cartagena, and had urged his
acceptance of it as the only course likely to restore him both
to health and position, and to meet the deferred hopes of his
sorrowing mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accept it, <i>sobrino m&iacute;o</i>,&rdquo; the uncle had said. &ldquo;Else, pass
your remaining days in confinement. There can be no refutation
of the charges against you. But, if these doors open again
to you, think not ever to sever your connection with the Church
of Rome. For, if the Rinc&oacute;n honor should prove inadequate to
hold you to your oath, be assured that Rinc&oacute;n justice will follow
you until the grave wipes out the stain upon our fair
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, <i>t&iacute;o m&iacute;o</i>, let the Church at once dismiss me, as unworthy
to be her son!&rdquo; pleaded Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, excommunication?&rdquo; cried the horrified uncle.
&ldquo;Never! Death first! Are you still mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked into the cold, emotionless eyes of the man and
shuddered. The ancient spirit of the Holy Inquisition lurked
there, and he cowered before it. But at least the semblance of
freedom had been offered him. His numbed heart already had
taken hope. He were indeed mad not to acquiesce in his uncle&rsquo;s
demands, and accept the proffered opportunity to leave forever
the scenes of his suffering and disgrace. And so he bowed
again before the inexorable.</p>
<p>Arriving in Cartagena some months before this narrative
opens, he had gradually yielded himself to the restorative effects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page93' name='book1_page93'></a>93</span>
of changed environment and the hope which his uncle&rsquo;s warm
assurances aroused, that a career would open to him in the
New World, unclouded by the climacteric episode of the publishing
of his journal and his subsequent arrogant bearing before
the Holy Father, which had provoked his fate. Under the
beneficent influences of the soft climate and the new interests
of this tropic land he began to feel a budding of something like
confidence, and the suggestions of an unfamiliar ambition to
retrieve past failure and yet gratify, even if in small measure,
the parental hope which had first directed him as a child into
the fold of the Church. The Bishop had assigned him at once to
pedagogical work in the University; and in the teaching of
history, the languages, and, especially, his beloved Greek, Jos&egrave;
had found an absorption that was slowly dimming the memory
of the dark days which he had left behind in the Old World.</p>
<p>But the University had not afforded him the only interest
in his new field. He had not been many weeks on Colombian
soil when his awakening perceptions sensed the people&rsquo;s oppression
under the tyranny of ecclesiastical politicians. Nor
did he fail to scent the approach of a tremendous conflict, in
which the country would pass through violent throes in the
struggle to shake off the galling yoke of Rome. Maintaining an
attitude of strict neutrality, he had striven quietly to gauge the
anticlerical movement, and had been appalled to find it so
widespread and menacing. Only a miracle could save unhappy
Colombia from being rent by the fiercest of religious wars in
the near future. Oh, if he but had the will, as he had the intellectual
ability, to throw himself into the widening breach!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one remedy,&rdquo; he murmured aloud, as he sat
one evening on a bench in the <i>plaza</i> of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, watching
the stream of gaily dressed promenaders parading slowly about
on the tesselated walks, but hearing little of their animated conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that, may I ask, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest roused up with a start. He had no idea that his
audible meditations had been overheard. Besides, he had
spoken in English. But this question had been framed in the
same tongue. He looked around. A tall, slender man, with
thin, bronzed face and well-trimmed Van Dyke beard, sat beside
him. The man laughed pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know that I should find any one here to-night who
could speak my lingo,&rdquo; he said cordially. &ldquo;But, I repeat, what
is the remedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; returned the amazed Jos&egrave;, without knowing
what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the condition to be remedied?&rdquo; continued the stranger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page94' name='book1_page94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This country&rsquo;s diseased&ndash;&ndash;but to whom have I the honor
of speaking?&rdquo; drawing himself up a little stiffly, and glancing
about to see who might be observing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my credentials?&rdquo; laughed the man, as he caught Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
wondering look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite unknown in Cartagena, unfortunately.
You must pardon my Yankee inquisitiveness, but I&rsquo;ve
watched you out here for several evenings, and have wondered
what weighty problems you were wrestling with. A quite unpardonable
offense, from the Spanish viewpoint, but wholly
forgivable in an uncouth American, I&rsquo;m sure. Besides, when I
heard you speak my language it made me a bit homesick, and
I wanted to hear more of the rugged tongue of the Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing again good-naturedly, he reached into an inner
pocket and drew out a wallet. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Hitt,&rdquo; he said, handing
Jos&egrave; his card. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t live up to it. That is, I failed
to make a hit up north, and so I&rsquo;m down here.&rdquo; He chuckled
at his own facetiousness. &ldquo;Amos A. Hitt,&rdquo; he went on affably.
&ldquo;There used to be a &lsquo;Reverend&rsquo; before it. That was when I was
exploring the Lord&rsquo;s throne. I&rsquo;ve dropped it, now that I&rsquo;m
humbly exploring His footstool instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; yielded to the man&rsquo;s friendly advances. This was not
the first American he had met; yet it seemed a new type, and
one that drew him strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think this country diseased, eh?&rdquo; the American continued.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; did not answer. While there was nothing in the
stranger&rsquo;s appearance and frank, open countenance to arouse
suspicion, yet he must be careful. He was living down one
frightful mistake. He could not risk another. But the man did
not wait for a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m quite agreed with you. It has <i>priest-itis</i>.&rdquo; He
stopped and looked curiously at Jos&egrave;, as if awaiting the effect of
his bold words. Then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I take it you are not really one of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stared at the man in amazement. Hitt laughed again.
Then he drew forth a cigar and held it out. &ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; he said.
The priest shook his head. Hitt lighted the cigar himself, then
settled back on the bench, his hands jammed into his trousers
pockets, and his long legs stuck straight out in front, to the
unconcealed annoyance of the passers-by. But, despite his
<i>brusquerie</i> and his thoughtlessness, there was something about
the American that was wonderfully attractive to the lonely
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Hitt went on abstractedly in corroboration of his
former statement, &ldquo;Colombia is absolutely stagnant, due to
Jesuitical politics, the bane of all good Catholic countries. If
she could shake off priestcraft she&rsquo;d have a chance&ndash;&ndash;provided
she didn&rsquo;t fall into orthodox Protestantism.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page95' name='book1_page95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; gasped, though he strove to hide his wonder. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
he began hesitatingly, &ldquo;you were in the ministry&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to come right out with it. I was a
Presbyterian divine some six years ago, in Cincinnati. Ever
been there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; assured him that he had never seen the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; mused the ex-preacher; &ldquo;great country&ndash;&ndash;wonderful&ndash;&ndash;none
like it in the world! I&rsquo;ve been all over, Europe, Asia,
Africa&ndash;&ndash;seen &rsquo;em all. America&rsquo;s the original Eden, and our
women are the only true descendants of mother Eve. No question
about it, that apple incident took place up in the States
somewhere&ndash;&ndash;probably in Ohio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; caught the man&rsquo;s infectious humor and laughed
heartily. Surely, this American was a tonic, and of the sort
that he most needed. &ldquo;Then, you are&ndash;&ndash;still touring&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m exploring,&rdquo; Hitt replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to study what ancient
records I may find in your library; then I shall go on to
Medellin and Bogot&aacute;. I&rsquo;m on the track of a prehistoric Inca
city, located somewhere in the Andes&ndash;&ndash;and no doubt in the most
inaccessible spot imaginable. Tradition cites this lost city as
the cradle of Inca civilization. Tampu Tocco, it is called in
their legends, the place from which the Incas went out to found
that marvelous empire which eventually included the greater
part of South America. The difficulty is,&rdquo; he added, knotting
his brows, &ldquo;that the city was evidently unknown to the Spaniards.
I can find no mention of it in Spanish literature, and
I&rsquo;ve searched all through the libraries of Spain. My only hope
now is that I shall run across some document down here that
will allude to it, or some one who has heard likely Indian
rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; rubbed his eyes and looked hard at the man. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
he ejaculated, &ldquo;you are&ndash;&ndash;if I may be permitted to say it&ndash;&ndash;an
original type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume I am,&rdquo; admitted the American genially. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been all sorts of things in my day, preacher, teacher, editor.
My father used to be a circuit rider in New England forty years
ago or more. Pious&ndash;&ndash;good Lord! Why, he was one of the kind
who believe the good book &lsquo;from kiver to kiver,&rsquo; you know.
Used to preach interminable sermons about the mercy of the
Lord in holding us all over the smoking pit and not dropping
us in! Why, man! after listening to him expound the Scriptures
at night I used to go to bed with my hair on end and
my skin all goose-flesh. No wonder I urged him to send me to
the Presbyterian Seminary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were ordained?&rdquo; queried Jos&egrave;, dark memories
rising in his own thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page96' name='book1_page96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thoroughly so! And glad I was of it, too, for I had grown
up as pious and orthodox as my good father. I considered the
ordination a through ticket to paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;now&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I found myself in time,&rdquo; continued the man, answering
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s unspoken thought. &ldquo;Then I stopped preaching beautiful
legends, and tried to be genuinely helpful to my congregation.
I had a fine church in Cincinnati at that time. But&ndash;&ndash;well, I
mixed a trifle too much heresy into my up-to-date sermons, I
guess. Anyway, the Assembly didn&rsquo;t approve my orthodoxy,
and I had as little respect for its heterodoxy, and the upshot
of it was that I quit&ndash;&ndash;cold.&rdquo; He laughed grimly as he finished
the recital. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on gravely, &ldquo;I now see that it was
due simply to my desire to progress beyond the acceptance of
tradition and allegory as truth, and to find some better foundation
upon which to build than the undemonstrable articles of
faith embraced in the Westminster Confession. To me, that
confession of faith had become a confession of ignorance.&rdquo; He
turned his shrewd eyes upon Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I was in somewhat the
same mental state that I think you are in now,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, if I may ask, are you now exploring?&rdquo; asked
Jos&egrave;, disregarding the implication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; replied the American easily, &ldquo;I used to
teach history and became especially interested in ancient civilizations,
lost cities, and the like, in the Western Hemisphere.
Long before I left the ministry oil was struck on our little Pennsylvania
farm, and&ndash;&ndash;well, I didn&rsquo;t have to work after that. So
for some years I&rsquo;ve devoted myself strictly to my particular
hobby of travel. And in my work I find it necessary to discard
ceremony, and scrape acquaintance with all sorts and conditions.
I especially cultivate clergymen. I&rsquo;ve wanted to know
you ever since I first saw you out here. But I couldn&rsquo;t wait for
a formal introduction. And so I broke in unceremoniously upon
your meditations a few moments ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to you for doing so,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; frankly, holding
out a hand. &ldquo;There is much that you can tell me&ndash;&ndash;much
that I want to know. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He again looked cautiously
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I understand,&rdquo; said Hitt, quickly sensing the priest&rsquo;s
uneasiness. &ldquo;What say you, shall we meet somewhere down by
the city wall? Say, at the old Inquisition cells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; nodded his acquiescence, and they separated. A few
minutes later the two were seated in one of the cavernous archways
of the long, echoing corridor which leads to the deserted
barracks and the gloomy, bat-infested cells beneath. A vagrant
breeze drifted now and then across the grim wall above them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page97' name='book1_page97'></a>97</span>
and the deserted road in front lay drenched in the yellow light
of the tropic moon. There was little likelihood of detection here,
where the dreamy plash of the sea drowned the low sound of
their voices; and Jos&egrave; breathed more freely than in the populous
<i>plaza</i> which they had just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; muttered the explorer, returning from a peep
into the foul blackness of a subterranean tunnel, &ldquo;imagine what
took place here some three centuries ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave; sadly; &ldquo;and in the reeking dungeons
of San Fernando, out there at the harbor entrance. And, what
is worse, my own ancestors were among the perpetrators of
those black deeds committed in the name of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! You don&rsquo;t say! Tell me about it.&rdquo; The explorer
drew closer. Jos&egrave; knew somehow that he could trust
this stranger, and so he briefly sketched his ancestral story to
his sympathetic listener. &ldquo;And no one knows,&rdquo; he concluded
in a depressed tone, &ldquo;how many of the thousands of victims of
the Inquisition in Cartagena were sent to their doom by the
house of Rinc&oacute;n. It may be,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;that the sins of my
fathers have been visited upon me&ndash;&ndash;that I am now paying in
part the penalty for their criminal zeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explorer sat for some time in silent meditation. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;your family fell under the spell of old Saint
Dominic. You know the legend? How God deliberated long
whether to punish the wickedness of mankind by sending down
war, plague, or famine, and was finally prevailed upon by Saint
Dominic to send, instead, the Holy Inquisition. Another choice
example of the convenient way the world has always had of
attributing the foulest deeds of men to the Almighty. No wonder
religion has so woefully declined!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it so up in the great North?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Tell me,
what is the religious status there? My limitations have been
such that I have&ndash;&ndash;I have not kept abreast of current theological
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the United States the conventional, passive submission
to orthodox dogma is rapidly becoming a thing of the past,&rdquo; the
explorer replied. &ldquo;The people are beginning to think on these
topics. All human opinion, philosophical, religious, or scientific,
is in a state of liquefaction&ndash;&ndash;not yet solidified. Just what
will crystallize out of the magma is uncertain. The country
is experiencing a religious crisis, and an irresistible determination
to <i>know</i> is abroad in the land. Everything is being turned
upside-down, and one hardly dares longer say what he believes,
for the dogma of to-day is the fairy-tale of to-morrow. And,
through it all, as some one has tersely said, &lsquo;orthodoxy is hanging
onto the coat-tails of progress in a vain attempt to stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page98' name='book1_page98'></a>98</span>
her.&rsquo; We are facing in the United States the momentous question,
Is Christianity a failure? Although no one knows what
Christianity really is. But one thing is certain, the brand of
Christianity handed out by Protestant and Catholic alike is
mighty close to the borderline of dismal failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there in the North no distinct trend in religious belief?&rdquo;
queried Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>The explorer hesitated. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;there is.
The man who holds and promulgates any belief, religious or
scientific, is being more and more insistently forced to the point
of demonstration. The citation of patristic authority is becoming
daily more thoroughly obsolete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is no one who demonstrates practical Christianity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Do you? Is there any one in your Church, or in the
Protestant faith, who does the works which Christ is reported
to have done? Is there any one who really tries to do them?
Or thinks he could if he tried? The good church Fathers from
the third century down could figure out that the world was
created on the night before the twenty-third of October, four
thousand and four B. C., and that Adam&rsquo;s fall occurred about
noon of the day he was created. They could dilate <i>ad nauseam</i>
on transubstantiation, the divine essence, and the mystery of
the Trinity; they could astonishingly allegorize the Bible legends,
and read into every word a deep, hidden, incomprehensible
sense; they could prove to their own satisfaction that
Adam composed certain of the Psalms; that Moses wrote every
word of the Pentateuch, even the story of his own death and
burial; and that the entire Bible was delivered by God to man,
word for word, just as it stands, including the punctuation.
And yet, not one of them followed the simple commands of
Jesus closely enough to enable him to cure a toothache, to say
nothing of generally healing the sick and raising the dead! Am
I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I am sorry to have to admit,&rdquo; murmured Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on the explorer, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what removed me
from the Presbyterian ministry. It is not Christianity that is
a dismal failure, but men&rsquo;s interpretation of it. Of true Christianity,
I confess I know little. Oh, I&rsquo;m a fine preacher! And
yet I am representative of thousands of others, like myself, all
at sea. Only, the others are either ashamed or afraid to make
this confession. But, in my case, my daily bread did not depend
upon my continuance in the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing that it had&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result doubtless would have been the same. The orthodox
faith was utterly failing to supply me with a satisfying interpretation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page99' name='book1_page99'></a>99</span>
of life, and it afforded me no means of escaping
the discords of mundane existence. It could only hold out an
undemonstrable promise of a life after death, provided I was
elected, and provided I did not too greatly offend the Creator
during the few short years that I might spend on earth. If I
did that, then, according to the glorious Westminster Confession,
I was doomed&ndash;&ndash;for we are not so fortunate as you in having
a purgatory from which we may escape through the suffrages
of the faithful,&rdquo; he concluded with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew, as he listened, that his own Church would hold
this man a blasphemer. The man by his own confession was
branded a Protestant heretic. And he, Jos&egrave;, was <i>anathema</i> for
listening to these sincere, brutally frank confidences, and tendering
them his warm sympathy. Yet he sat spellbound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I retired from the ministry,&rdquo; continued the explorer.
&ldquo;I had become ashamed of tearing down other men&rsquo;s
religious beliefs. I was weary of having to apologize constantly
for the organization to which I was attached. At home I had
been taught a devout faith in revealed religion; in the world I
was thrown upon its inquiring doubts; I yearned for faith, yet
demanded scientific proof. Why, I would have been satisfied
with even the slight degree of proof which we are able to advance
for our various physical sciences. But, no, it was not
forthcoming. I must believe because the Fathers had believed.
I struggled between emotion and reason, until&ndash;&ndash;well, until I
had to throw it all over to keep from going mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; bowed in silence before this recital of a soul-experience
so closely paralleling his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, come,&rdquo; said the explorer cheerily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing all the
talking. Now&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; interrupted the eager Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I do not wish to
talk. I want to hear you. Go on, I beg of you! Your words are
like rain to a parched field. You will yet offer me something
upon which I can build with new hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be so sanguine, my friend,&rdquo; returned the explorer
in a kindly tone. &ldquo;I fear I shall be only the reaper, who cuts
the weeds and stubble, and prepares the field for the sower. I
have said that I am an explorer. But my field is not limited to
this material world. I am an explorer of men&rsquo;s thoughts as
well. I am in search of a religion. I manifest this century&rsquo;s
earnest quest for demonstrable truth. And so I stop and question
every one I meet, if perchance he may point me in the
right direction. My incessant wandering about the globe is, if
I may put it that way, but the outward manifestation of my
ceaseless search in the realm of the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. Then, reaching out and laying a hand upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page100' name='book1_page100'></a>100</span>
priest&rsquo;s knee, he said in a low, earnest voice, &ldquo;My friend, <i>something</i>
happened in that first year of our so-called Christian era.
What it was we do not know. But out of the smoke and dust,
the haze and mist of that great cataclysm has proceeded the
character Jesus&ndash;&ndash;absolutely unique. It is a character which
has had a terrific influence upon the world ever since. Because
of it empires have crumbled; a hundred million human lives
have been destroyed; and the thought-processes of a world have
been overthrown or reversed. Just what he said, just what he
did, just how he came, and how he went, we may not know with
any high degree of accuracy. But, beneath all the myth and
legend, the lore and childish human speculation of the intervening
centuries, there <i>must</i> be a foundation of eternal truth.
And it must be broad&ndash;&ndash;very broad. I am digging for it&ndash;&ndash;as I
dug on the sites of ancient Troy and Babylon&ndash;&ndash;as I have dug
over the buried civilizations of Mexico and Yucatan&ndash;&ndash;as I shall
dig for the hidden Inca towns on the wooded heights of the
Andes. And while I dig materially I am also digging spiritually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you found?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave; hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still in the overburden of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which the sedulous,
tireless Fathers heaped mountain high upon the few recorded
teachings of Jesus. But already I see indications of things to
come that would make the members of the Council of Trent and
the cocksure framers of the Westminster Confession burst from
their graves by sheer force of astonishment! There are even
now foreshadowings of such revolutionary changes in our concept
of God, of the universe, of matter, and the human mind,
of evil, and all the controverted points of theological discussion
of this day, as to make me tremble when I contemplate them.
In my first hasty judgment, after dipping into the &lsquo;Higher Criticism,&rsquo;
I concluded that Jesus was but a charlatan, who had
learned thaumaturgy in Egypt and practiced it in Judea.
Thanks to a better appreciation of the same &lsquo;Higher Criticism&rsquo;
I am reconstructing my concept of him now, and on a better
basis. I once denounced God as the creator of both good and
evil, and of a man who He knew must inevitably fall, even
before the clay of which he was made had become fairly dry.
I changed that concept later to Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s &lsquo;that something
not ourselves that makes for righteousness.&rsquo; But mighty
few to-day recognize such a God! Again, in Jesus&rsquo; teaching that
sin brought death into the world, I began to see what is so dimly
foreshadowed to-day, the <i>mental</i> nature of all things. &lsquo;Sin&rsquo; is
the English translation of the original &lsquo;<i>hamartio</i>,&rsquo; which means,
&lsquo;to miss the mark,&rsquo; a term used in archery. Well, then, missing
the mark is the mental result of nonconformity to law, is it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page101' name='book1_page101'></a>101</span>
not? And, going further, if death is the result of missing the
mark, and that is itself due to mental cause, and, since death
results from sickness, old age, or catastrophe, then these things
must likewise be mental. Sickness, therefore, becomes wholly
mental, does it not? Death becomes mental. Sin is mental.
Spirit, the Creator, is mental. Matter is mental. And we live
and act in a mental realm, do we not? The sick man, then, becomes
one who misses the mark, and therefore a sinner. I
think you will agree with me that the sick man is not at peace
with God, if God is &lsquo;that which makes for righteousness.&rsquo; Surely
the maker of that old Icelandic sixteenth-century Bible must
have been inspired when, translating from Luther&rsquo;s Bible, he
wrote in the first chapter of Genesis, &lsquo;And God created man
after His own likeness, in the likeness of <i>Mind</i> shaped He him.&rsquo;
Cannot you see the foreshadowing to which I have referred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; kept silence. The current of his thought seemed about
to swerve from its wonted course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is coming is this,&rdquo; continued the explorer earnestly,
&ldquo;a tremendous broadening of our concept of God, a more exalted,
a more worthy concept of Him as spirit&ndash;&ndash;or, if you will,
as mind. An abandonment of the puerile concept of Him as a
sort of magnified man, susceptible to the influence of preachers,
or of Virgin and Saints, and yielding to their petitions, to their
higher sense of justice, and to money-bought earthly ceremonies
to lift an imaginary curse from His own creatures. And with
it will come that wonderful consciousness of Him which I now
begin to realize that Jesus must have had, a consciousness of
Him as omnipotent, omnipresent good. As I to-day read the
teachings of Jesus I am constrained to believe that he was conscious
<i>only</i> of God and God&rsquo;s spiritual manifestation. And in
that remarkable consciousness the man Jesus realized his own
life&ndash;&ndash;indeed, that consciousness <i>was</i> his life&ndash;&ndash;and it included
no sense of evil. The great lesson which I draw from it is that
evil must, therefore, be utterly unreal and non-existent. And
heaven is but the acquisition of that mind or consciousness
which was in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Hitt, such ideas are revolutionary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, if immediately and generally adopted. And so you
see why the Church strives to hold the people to its own archaic
and innocuous religious tenets; why your Church strives so
zealously to hold its adherents fast to the rules laid down by
pagan emperors and ignorant, often illiterate churchmen, in
their councils and synods; and why the Protestant church is so
quick to denounce as unevangelical everything that does not
measure to its devitalized concept of Christianity. They do
not practice what they preach; yet they would not have you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page102' name='book1_page102'></a>102</span>
practice anything else. The human mind that calls itself a
Christian is a funny thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed lightly; then lapsed into silence. The sea breeze
rose and sighed among the great, incrusted arches. The restless
waves moaned in their eternal assault upon the defiant walls.
The moon clouded, and a warm rain began to fall. Jos&egrave; rose.
&ldquo;I must return to the dormitory,&rdquo; he announced briefly. &ldquo;When
you pass me in the <i>plaza</i> to-morrow evening, come at once to
this place. I will meet you here. You have&ndash;&ndash;I must&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not finish. Pressing the explorer&rsquo;s hand, he
turned abruptly and hurried up the dim, narrow street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>
</div>
<p>All through the following day the priest mused over the
conversation of the preceding night. The precipitation
with which this new friendship had been formed, and the
subsequent abrupt exchange of confidences, had scarcely impressed
him as unusual. He was wholly absorbed by the radical
thought which the man had voiced. He mulled over it in his
wakeful hours that night. He could not prevent it from coloring
the lecture which he delivered to his class in ancient history
that day. And when the sun at length dropped behind La
Popa, he hurried eagerly to the <i>plaza</i>. A few minutes later he
and the ex-clergyman met in the appointed rendezvous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped in to have a look at the remains of Pedro Claver
to-day,&rdquo; his new friend remarked. &ldquo;The old sexton scraped and
bowed with huge joy as he led me behind the altar and lighted
up the grewsome thing. I suppose he believed that Pedro&rsquo;s soul
was up in the clouds making intercession with the Lord for
him, while he, poor devil, was toting tourists around to gaze
at the Saint&rsquo;s ghastly bones in their glass coffin. The thing
would be funny were it not for its sad side, namely, the dense
and superstitious ignorance in which such as this poor sexton
are held all their lives by your Church. It&rsquo;s a shame to feed
them with the bones of dead Saints, instead of with the bread of
life! But,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;I was myself just as bigoted at one
time. And my zeal to convert the world to Protestantism was
just as hot as any that ever animated the missionaries of your
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked quizzically at Jos&egrave;. He seemed to be
studying the length to which he could go in his criticism of
the ancient faith of the house of Rinc&oacute;n. But Jos&egrave; remained
in expectant silence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page103' name='book1_page103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of missionaries,&rdquo; the man resumed, &ldquo;I shall never
forget an experience I had in China. My wealthy and ultra-aristocratic
congregation decided that I needed rest, and so
sent me on a world tour. It was a member of that same congregation,
by the way, a stuffy old dame whose wealth footed
up to millions, who once remarked to me in all confidence that
she had no doubt the aristocracy of heaven was composed of
Presbyterians. Poor, old, empty-headed prig! What could I do
but assure her that I held the same comforting conviction!
Well, through influential friends in Pekin I was introduced to
the eminent Chinese statesman, Wang Fo, of delightful memory.
Our conversation turned on religion, and then I made the most
inexcusable <i>faux pas</i> that a blithering Yankee could make, that
of expressing regret that he was not of our faith. Good heavens!
But he was the most gracious gentleman in the world, and his
biting rebuke was couched in tones of silken softness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is it that you offer me?&rsquo; he said mildly. &lsquo;Blind
opinion? Undemonstrated and undemonstrable theory? Why,
may I ask, do you come over here to convert us heathen, when
your own Christian land is rife with evil, with sedition, with
religious hatred of man for man, with bloodshed and greed?
If your religious belief is true, then you can demonstrate it&ndash;&ndash;prove
it beyond doubt. Do you say that the wonderful material
progress which your great country manifests is due to
Christianity? I answer you, no. It is due to the unfettering of
the human mind, to the laying off of much of the mediaeval
superstition which in the past ages has blighted mankind. It
is due largely to the abandonment of much of what you are
still pleased to call Christianity. The liberated human mind
has expanded to a degree never before seen in the world. We
Chinese are still mentally fettered by our stubborn resistance to
change, to progression. Your great inventors and your great
men of finance are but little hampered by religious superstition.
Hence the mental flights which they so boldly undertake, and
the stupendous achievements they attain. Is it not so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I say? He had me. But he hadn&rsquo;t finished me
quite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I once devoted much time to the study of Chemistry,&rsquo; he
went on blandly, &lsquo;and when I tell you that there is a law to
the effect that the volume of a gas is a function of its pressure
I do so with the full knowledge that I can furnish you
indisputable proof therefor. But when you come to me with
your religious theories, and I mildly request your proofs, you
wish to imprison or hang me for doubting the absurdities which
you cannot establish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed genially, then took me kindly by the arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page104' name='book1_page104'></a>104</span>
&lsquo;Proof, my zealous friend, proof,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Give me proof this
side of the grave for what you believe, and then you will have
converted the heathen. And can your Catholic friend&ndash;&ndash;or,
shall I say enemy?&ndash;&ndash;prove his laughable doctrine of purgatory?
The dead in purgatory dependent upon the living! Why, I tell
him, that smacks of Shintoism, wherein the living feed the
dead! Then he points in holy indignation to the Bible. Bah!
Cannot I prove anything I may wish from your Bible? What
will you have? Polygamy? Incest? Murder? Graft? Hand
me your Bible, and I will establish its divinity. No, my good
friend. When you come to me with proofs that you really do
the works of him whom you profess to follow, then will I
gladly listen, for I, too, seek truth. But in the present deplorable
absence of proofs I take much more comfort in the adoration
of my amiable ancestors than I could in your laughable
and undemonstrable religious creeds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left his presence a saddened but chastened man, and went
home to do a little independent thinking. When I approached
my Bible without the bias of the Westminster Confession I discovered
that it did serve admirably as a wardrobe in which to
hang any sort of religious prejudice. Continued study made
me see that religious faith is generally mere human credulity.
I discovered that in my pitying contempt for those of differing
belief I much resembled the Yankee who ridiculed a Chinaman
for wearing a pig-tail. &lsquo;True,&rsquo; the Celestial replied, &lsquo;we still
wear the badge of our former slavery. But you emancipated
Americans, do you not wear the badge of a present and much
worse form of slavery in your domination by Tammany Hall,
by your corrupt politicians, and your organizers and protectors
of crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As time passed I gradually began to feel much more
kindly toward Matthew Arnold, who said, &lsquo;Orthodox theology
is an immense misunderstanding of the Bible.&rsquo; And I began
likewise to respect his statement that our Bible language is
&lsquo;fluid and passing&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that much of it is the purest poetry, beautiful
and inspiring, but symbolical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; broke in Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;you must admit that there is something
awfully wrong with the world, with&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interrupted Hitt, &ldquo;and what is it? As historical
fact, that story about Adam and Eve eating an apple and thereby
bringing down God&rsquo;s curse upon the whole innocent human
race is but a figment of little minds, and an insult to divine intelligence.
But, as symbolizing the dire penalty we pay for a
belief in the reality of both good and evil&ndash;&ndash;ah, that is a note
just beginning to be sounded in the world at large. And it
may account for the presence of the world&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page105' name='book1_page105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, our experience certainly shows that evil is just as real
and just as immanent as good! And, indeed, more powerful
in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; replied the explorer gravely, &ldquo;then God created or
instituted it. And in that case I must break with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think it is all a question of our own individual
idea of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely. And human concepts of Him have been many
and varied. But that worst of Old Testament interpreters of
the first century, Philo, came terribly close to the truth, I
think, when, in a burst of inspiration, he one day wrote: &lsquo;Heaven
is mind, and earth is sensation.&rsquo; Matthew Arnold, I think,
likewise came very close to the truth when he said that the
only God we can recognize is &lsquo;that something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness.&rsquo; And, as for evil, up in the United
States there are some who are now lumping it all under the
head of &lsquo;mortal mind,&rsquo; considering it all but the &lsquo;one lie&rsquo; which
Jesus so often referred to, and regarding it as the &lsquo;suppositional
opposite&rsquo; of the mind that is God, and so, powerless. Not a bad
idea, I think. But whether the money-loving Yankee will ever
leave his mad chase for gold long enough to live this premise
and so demonstrate it, is a question. I&rsquo;m watching its development
with intense interest. We in the States have wonderful,
exceptional opportunities for study and research. We ought to
uncover the truth, if any people should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell into thoughtfulness again. Jos&egrave; drew a long sigh.
&ldquo;I wish&ndash;&ndash;I wish,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;that I might go there&ndash;&ndash;that I
might live and work and search up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explorer roused up. &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
&ldquo;Look here, come with me and spend a year or so digging
around for buried Inca towns. Then we will go back to the
States. Why, man! it would make you over. I&rsquo;ll take you as
interpreter. And in the States I&rsquo;ll find a place for you. Come.
Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the doors of imagination swung wide, and in
the burst of light from within Jos&egrave; saw the dreams of a lifetime
fulfilled. Emancipation lay that way. Freedom, soul-expansion,
truth. It was his God-given privilege. Who had
the right to lay a detaining hand upon him? Was not his soul
his own, and his God&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>Then a dark hand stole out from the surrounding shadows
and closed the doors. From the blackness there seemed to rise
a hollow voice, uttering the single word, <i>Honor</i>. He thrust out
an arm, as if to ward off the assaults of temptation. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;
he said aloud, &ldquo;I am bound to the Church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why remain longer in an institution with which you
are quite out of sympathy?&rdquo; the explorer urged.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page106' name='book1_page106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;First, to help the Church. Who will uplift her if we desert
her? And, second, to help this, my ancestral country,&rdquo;
replied Jos&egrave; in deep earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy aims, both,&rdquo; assented Hitt. &ldquo;But, my friend, what
will you accomplish here, unless you can educate these people
to think? I have learned much about conditions in this
country. I find that the priest in Colombia is even more intolerant
than in Ireland, for here he has a monopoly, no competition.
He is absolute. The Colombian is the logical product
of the doctrines of Holy Church. It is so in Mexico. It is so
wherever the curse of a fixed mentality is imposed upon a
people. For that engenders determined opposition to mobility.
It quenches responsiveness to new concepts and new ideas. It
throttles a nation. The bane of mental progress is the <i>Semper
Idem</i> of your Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity will remove the curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt whatever of that. It probably is the future
cure for all social ills and evils of every sort. But if so, it
must be the Christianity which Jesus taught and demonstrated&ndash;&ndash;not
the theological chaff now disseminated in his name. Do
not forget that we no longer know what Christianity is. It is
a lost science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can and will be recovered!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said that is foreshadowed. But we must have the
whole garment of the Christ, without human <i>addenda</i>. He is
reported as having said, &lsquo;The works that I do bear witness of
me.&rsquo; Now the works of the Christian Church bear ample witness
that she has not the true understanding of the Christ. Nor
has that eminent Protestant divine, now teaching in a theological
seminary in the States, who recently said that, although
Jesus ministered miraculously to the physical man, yet it was
not his intention that his disciples should continue that sort of
ministry; that the healing which Jesus did was wholly incidental,
and was not an example to be permanently imitated. Good
heavens! how these poor theologians hide their inability to do
the works of the Master by taking refuge in such ridiculously
unwarranted assertions. To them the rule seems to be that,
if you can&rsquo;t do a thing you must deny the possibility of its
being done. Great logic, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;the Church has had nearly two
thousand years in which to learn to do the works of the Master.
Pretty dull pupil, I think. And we&rsquo;ve had nearly two thousand
years of theology from this slow pupil. Would that she would
from now on give us a little real Christianity! Heavens! the
world needs it. And yet, do you know, sectarian feeling is
still so bitter in the so-called Church of God that if a Bishop of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page107' name='book1_page107'></a>107</span>
the Anglican Church should admit Presbyterians, Methodists,
or members of other denominations to his communion table a
scream of rage would go up all over England, and a mighty demand
would be raised to impeach the Bishop for heresy!
Think of it! God above! the puny human mind. Do you
wonder that the dogma of the Church has lost force? That,
despite its thunders, thinking men laugh? I freely admit that
our great need is to find an adequate substitute for the authority
which others would like to impose upon us. But where shall we
find such authority, if not in those who demonstrate their
ability to do the works of the Master? Show me your works,
and I&rsquo;ll show you my faith. This is my perpetual challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;returning to the subject so near your
heart: the condition of this country is that of a large part of
South America, where the population is unsettled, even turbulent,
and where a priesthood, fanatical, intolerant, often unscrupulous,
pursue their devious means to extend and perpetuate
unhindered the sway of your Church. Colombia is struggling
to remove the blight which Spain laid upon her, namely,
mediaeval religion. It is this same blighting religion, coupled
with her remorseless greed, which has brought Spain to her
present decrepit, empty state. And how she did strive to
force that religion upon the world! Whole nations, like the
Incas, for example, ruthlessly slaughtered by the papal-benisoned
riffraff of Spain in her attempts to foist herself into
world prestige and to bolster up the monstrous assumptions of
Holy Church! The Incas were a grand nation, with a splendid
mental viewpoint. But it withered under the touch of the
mediaeval narrowness fastened upon it. Whole nations wasted
in support of papal assumptions&ndash;&ndash;and do you think that the
end is yet? Far from it! War is coming here in Colombia. It
may come in other parts of this Western Hemisphere, certainly
in Mexico, certainly in Peru and Bolivia and Chili, rocked in
the cradle of Holy Church for ages, but now at last awaking to
a sense of their backward condition and its cause. If ever the
Church had a chance to show what she could do when given a
free hand, she has had it in these countries, particularly in
Mexico. In all the nearly four centuries of her unmolested
control in that fair land, oppressed by sword and crucifix, did
she ever make an attempt worth the name to uplift and emancipate
the common man? Not one. She took his few, hard-earned
<i>pesos</i> to get his weary soul out of an imagined purgatory&ndash;&ndash;but
she left him to rot in peonage while on earth! But, friend, I
repeat, the struggle is coming here in Colombia. And look you
well to your own escape when it arrives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can I do nothing to help avert it?&rdquo; cried the distressed
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page108' name='book1_page108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the explorer meditatively, &ldquo;such bondage
is removable either through education or war. But in Colombia
I fear the latter will overtake the former by many decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then rest assured that I shall in the meantime do what in
me lies to instruct my fellow-countrymen, and to avoid such a
catastrophe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, friend. And&ndash;&ndash;by the way, here is a
little book that may help you in your work. I&rsquo;m quite sure
you&rsquo;ve never read it. Under the ban, you know. Renan&rsquo;s <i>Vie
de J&eacute;sus</i>. It can do you no harm, and may be useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; reached out and took the little volume. It was <i>anathema</i>,
he knew, but he could not refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is another book that I strongly recommend to
you. I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t a copy here. It once created quite a
sensation. It is called, &lsquo;Confessions of a Roman Catholic Priest.&rsquo;
Published anonymously, in Vienna, but unquestionably bearing
the earmarks of authenticity. It mentions this country&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without speaking, Jos&egrave; had slowly risen and started down
the musty corridor, his thought aflame with the single desire to
get away. Down past the empty barracks and gaping cells he
went, without stopping to peer into their tenebrous depths&ndash;&ndash;on
and on, skirting the grim walls that typified the mediaevalism
surrounding and fettering his restless thought&ndash;&ndash;on to the long
incline which led up to the broad esplanade on the summit.
Must he forever flee this pursuing Nemesis? Or should he hurl
himself from the wall, once he gained the top? At the upper
end of the incline he heard the low sound of voices. A priest
and a young girl who sat there on the parapet rose as he approached.
He stopped abruptly in front of them. &ldquo;Wenceslas!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;And Maria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>amigo</i>, a quiet stroll before retiring? It is a sultry
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; slowly replied Jos&egrave;, looking at the girl, who drew
back into the shadow cast by the body of her companion. Then,
bowing, he passed on down the wall and disappeared in the
darkness that shrouded the distance.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the long form of the explorer appeared
above the incline. Wenceslas and the girl had departed. Seeing
no one, the American turned and descended to the ground,
shaking his head in deep perplexity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>
</div>
<p>The next day was one of the Church&rsquo;s innumerable feast-days,
and Jos&egrave; was free to utilize it as he might. He
determined on a visit to the suburb of Turbaco, some
eight miles from Cartagena, and once the site of Don Ignacio&rsquo;s
magnificent country home. Although he had been some months
in Cartagena, he had never before felt any desire to pass beyond
its walls. Now it seemed to him that he must break the limitation
which those encircling walls typified, that his restless
thought might expand ere it formulated into definite concepts
and plans for future work. This morning he wanted to be
alone. The old injury done to his sensitive spirit by the publication
of his journal had been unwittingly opened anew. The
old slowness had crept again into his gait since the evening
before. Over night his countenance had resumed its wonted
heaviness; and his slender shoulders bent again beneath their
former burden.</p>
<p>When Jos&egrave; arrived in Cartagena he had found it a city of
vivid contrasts. There mediaevalism still strove with the spirit
of modern progress; and so it suited well as an environment for
the dilation of his shrunken soul-arteries. The lethal influence
of the monastery long lay over him, beneath which he continued
to manifest those eccentric habits which his prolonged
state of loneliness had engendered. He looked askance at the
amenities which his associates tentatively held out to him. He
sank himself deep in study, and for weeks, even months, he
shunned the world of people and things. He found no stimulus
to a search for his ancestral palace within the city, nor for a
study of the Rinc&oacute;n records which lay moldering in the ancient
city&rsquo;s archives.</p>
<p>But, as the sunlit days drifted dreamily past with peaceful,
unvarying monotony, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s faculties, which had always been
alert until he had been declared insane, gradually awakened.
His violently disturbed balance began to right itself; his equilibrium
became in a measure restored. The deadening thought
that he had accomplished nothing in his vitiated life yielded to
a hopeful determination to yet retrieve past failure. The pride
and fear which had balked the thought of self-destruction now
served to fan the flame of fresh resolve. He dared not do any
writing, it was true. But he could delve and study. And a
thousand avenues opened to him through which he could serve
his fellow-men. The papal instructions which his traveling
companion, the Apostolic Delegate, had brought to the Bishop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page110' name='book1_page110'></a>110</span>
of Cartagena, evidently had sufficed for his credentials; and
the latter had made no occasion to refer to the priest&rsquo;s past. An
order from the Vatican was law; and the Bishop obeyed it with
no other thought than its inerrancy and inexorability. And
with the lapse of the several months which had slipped rapidly
away while he sought to forget and to clear from his mind the
dark clouds of melancholia which had settled over it, Jos&egrave; became
convinced that the Bishop knew nothing of his career
prior to his arrival in Colombia.</p>
<p>And it is possible that the young priest&rsquo;s secret would have
died with him&ndash;&ndash;that he would have lived out his life amid the
peaceful scenes of this old, romantic town, and gone to his long
rest at last with the consciousness of having accomplished his
mite in the service of his fellow-beings; it is possible that Rome
would have forgotten him; and that his uncle&rsquo;s ambitions, to
which he knew that he had been regarded as in some way useful,
would have flagged and perished over the watery waste
which separated the New World from the Old, but for the intervention
of one man, who crossed Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s path early in his
new life, found him inimical to his own worldly projects, and
removed him, therefore, as sincerely in the name of Christ as
the ancient <i>Conquistadores</i>, with priestly blessing, hewed from
their paths of conquest the simple and harmless aborigines.</p>
<p>That man was Wenceslas Ortiz, trusted servant of Holy
Church, who had established himself in Cartagena to keep a
watchful eye on anticlerical proceedings. That he was able to
do this, and at the same time turn them greatly to his own
advantage, marks him as a man of more than usually keen and
resourceful mentality. He was a native son, born of prosperous
parents in the riverine town of Mompox, which, until the erratic
Magdalena sought for itself a new channel, was the chief port
between Barranquilla and the distant Honda. There had been
neither family custom nor parental hopes to consider among
the motives which had directed him into the Church. He was a
born worldling, but with unmistakable talents for and keen
appreciation of the art of politics. His love of money was subordinate
only to his love of power. To both, his talents made
access easy. In the contemplation of a career in his early years
he had hesitated long between the Church and the Army; but
had finally thrown his lot with the former, as offering not only
equal possibilities of worldly preferment and riches, but far
greater stability in those periodic revolutions to which his
country was so addicted. The Army was frequently overthrown;
the Church, never. The Government changed with
every successful political revolution; the Church remained immovable.
And so with the art of a trained politician he cultivated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page111' name='book1_page111'></a>111</span>
his chosen field with such intensity that even the Holy
See felt the glow of his ardor, and in recognition of his marked
abilities, his pious fervor and great influence, was constrained
to place him just where he wished to be, at the right hand of
the Bishop of Cartagena, and probable successor to that aged
incumbent, who had grown to lean heavily and confidingly upon
him.</p>
<p>As coadjutor, or suffragan to the Bishop of Cartagena, Wenceslas
Ortiz had at length gathered unto himself sufficient influence
of divers nature as, in his opinion, to ensure him the
See in case the bishopric should, as was contemplated, be
raised eventually to the status of a Metropolitan. It was he,
rather than the Bishop, who distributed parishes to ambitious
pastors and emoluments to greedy politicians. His irons in
ecclesiastical, political, social and commercial fires were innumerable.
The doctrine of the indivisibility of Church and
State had in him an able champion&ndash;&ndash;but only because he
thereby found a sure means of increasing his prestige and augmenting
his power and wealth. His methods of work manifested
keenness, subtlety, shrewdness and skill. His rewards
were lavish. His punishments, terrible. The latter smacked of
the Inquisition: he preferred torture to quick despatch.</p>
<p>It had not taken Wenceslas long to estimate the character
of the newcomer, Jos&egrave;. Nor was he slow to perceive that this
liberal pietist was cast in an unusual mold. Polity necessitated
the cultivation of Jos&egrave;, as it required the friendship&ndash;&ndash;or, in any
event, the thorough appraisement&ndash;&ndash;of every one with whom
Wenceslas might be associated. But the blandishments, artifice,
diplomacy and hints of advancements which he poured out
in profusion upon Jos&egrave; he early saw would fail utterly to penetrate
the armor of moral reserve with which the priest was
clad, or effect in the slightest degree the impression which they
were calculated to make.</p>
<p>In the course of time the priest became irritating; later,
annoying; and finally, positively dangerous to the ambitions of
Wenceslas. For, to illustrate, Jos&egrave; had once discovered him,
in the absence of the Bishop, celebrating Mass in a state of inebriation.
This irritated. Wenceslas had only been careless.
Again, Jos&egrave; had several times shown himself suspicious of his
fast-and-loose methods with the rival political factions of Cartagena.
This was annoying. Finally, he had come upon Jos&egrave;
in the market place a few weeks prior, in earnest conference
with Marcelena and the girl, Maria; and subsequent conversation
with him developed the fact that the priest had other dark
suspicions which were but too well founded. This was dangerous.
It was high time to prepare for possible contingencies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page112' name='book1_page112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>And so, in due time, carefully wording his hint that Padre
Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n might be a Radical spy in the ecclesiastical
camp, Wenceslas found means to obtain from Rome a fairly
comprehensive account of the priest&rsquo;s past history. He mused
over this until an idea suddenly occurred to him, namely, the
similarity of this account with many of the passages which he
had found in a certain book, &ldquo;The Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a book which had cast the shadow of distrust
upon Wenceslas himself in relation to certain matters of
ecclesiastical politics in Colombia nearly three years before, and
at a most unfortunate time. Indeed, this sudden, unheralded
exposure had forced him to a hurried recasting of certain
cherished plans, and drawn from him a burning, unquenchable
desire to lay his pious hands upon the writer.</p>
<p>His influence with Rome at length revealed the secret of the
wretched book&rsquo;s authorship. And from the moment that he
learned it, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s fate was sealed. The crafty politician laughed
aloud as he read the priest&rsquo;s history. Then he drew his plans
and waited. But in the interim he made further investigations;
and these he extended far back into the ancestral history of this
unfortunate scion of the once powerful house of Rinc&oacute;n.</p>
<p>Meantime, a few carefully chosen words to the Bishop
aroused a dull interest in that quarter. Jos&egrave; had been seen
mingling freely with men of very liberal political views. It
would be well to warn him. Again, weeks later, Wenceslas was
certain, from inquiries made among the students, that Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
work in the classroom bordered a trifle too closely on radicalism.
It were well to admonish him. And, still later, happening
to call at Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s quarters just above his own in the
ecclesiastical dormitory, and not finding him in, he had been
struck by the absence of crucifix or other religious symbol in
the room. Was the young priest becoming careless of his
example?</p>
<p>And now, on this important feast-day, where was Padre
Jos&egrave;? On the preceding evening, as Wenceslas leaned over the
parapet of the wall after his surprise by Jos&egrave;, he had noted in
the dim light the salient features of a foreigner who, he had
just learned, was registered at the Hotel Mariano from the
United States. Moreover, Wenceslas had just come from Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
room, whither he had gone in search of him, and&ndash;&ndash;may the
Saints pardon his excess of holy zeal which impelled him to
examine the absent priest&rsquo;s effects!&ndash;&ndash;he had returned now to
the Bishop bearing a copy of Renan&rsquo;s <i>Vie de J&eacute;sus</i>, with the
American&rsquo;s name on the flyleaf. It certainly were well to admonish
Padre Jos&egrave; again, and severely!</p>
<p>The Bishop, hardly to the surprise of his crafty coadjutor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page113' name='book1_page113'></a>113</span>
flew into a towering rage. He was a man of irascible temper,
bitterly intolerant, and unreasoningly violent against all unbelievers,
especially Americans whose affairs brought them to
Colombia. In this respect he was the epitome of the ecclesiastical
anti-foreign sentiment which obtained in that country.
His intolerance of heretics was such that he would gladly have
bound his own kin to the stake had he believed their opinions
unorthodox. Yet he was thoroughly conscientious, a devout
churchman, and saturated with the beliefs of papal infallibility
and the divine origin of the Church. In the observance of
church rites and ceremonies he was unremitting. In the soul-burning
desire to witness the conversion of the world, and especially
to see the lost children of Europe either coaxed or beaten
back into the embrace of Holy Church, his zeal amounted to
fanaticism. In the present case&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Eminence,&rdquo; suggested the suave Wenceslas to his exasperated
superior, &ldquo;may I propose that you defer action until
I can discover the exact status of this American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Bishop forthwith placed the whole matter in his
trusted assistant&rsquo;s helpful hands.</p>
<p>Meantime, Jos&egrave; and the American explorer sat in the shade
of a magnificent palm on a high hill in beautiful Turbaco, looking
out over the shimmering sea beyond. For Hitt had wandered
into the <i>Plaza de Coches</i> just as Jos&egrave; was taking a carriage,
and the latter could not well refuse his proffered companionship
for the day. Yet Jos&egrave; feared to be seen in broad
daylight with this stranger, and he involuntarily murmured a
<i>Loado sea Dios</i>! when they reached Turbaco, as he believed,
unobserved. He did not know that a sharp-eyed young novitiate,
whom Wenceslas had detailed to keep the priest under
surveillance, had hurried back to his superior with the report
of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s departure with the <i>Americano</i> on this innocent pleasure
jaunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more, my friend, in apology for your abrupt departure
last evening,&rdquo; the explorer urged. &ldquo;But tell me, rather,
about your illustrious grandfather who had his country seat in
this delightful spot. Why, man! this is paradise. I&rsquo;ve a notion
to come here to live some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; cast his apprehensions upon the soft ocean breeze, and
gave himself up to the inspiriting influence of his charming
environment. He dwelt at length upon the Rinc&oacute;n greatness
of mediaeval days, and expressed the resolve sometime to delve
into the family records which he knew must be hidden away
in the moldering old city of Cartagena. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he concluded,
after another reference to the Church, &ldquo;is Colombia to
witness again the horror of those days of carnage? And over
the human mind&rsquo;s interpretation of the Christ? God forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page114' name='book1_page114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>The American shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;There is but one
remedy&ndash;&ndash;education. Not sectarian, partisan, worldly education&ndash;&ndash;not
instruction in relative truths and the chaff of materialistic
speculation&ndash;&ndash;but that sort of education whereby the selfish
human mind is lifted in a measure out of itself, out of its petty
jealousies and envyings, out of sneaking graft and touting for
worldly emolument, and into a sense of the eternal truth that
real prosperity and soundness of states and institutions are to
be realized only when the Christ-principle, &lsquo;Love thy neighbor
as thyself,&rsquo; is made the measure of conduct. There is a tremendous
truth which has long since been demonstrated, and
yet which the world is most woefully slow to grasp, namely,
that the surest, quickest means of realizing one&rsquo;s own prosperity
and happiness is in that of others&ndash;&ndash;not in a world to
come, but right here and now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that means the inauguration of the millennium,&rdquo; protested
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and why not so?&rdquo; returned the explorer calmly.
&ldquo;Has not that been the ultimate aim of Christianity, and of all
serious effort for reform for the past two thousand years?
And, do you know, the millennium could be ushered in to-morrow,
if men only thought so? Within an incredibly short
time evil, even to death itself, could be completely wiped off
the earth. But this wiping-off process must take place in the
minds and thoughts of men. Of that I am thoroughly convinced.
But, tell me, have you ever expressed to the Bishop
your views regarding the condition of this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; flushed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied in embarrassment. &ldquo;Only
a week ago I tried again to convince him of the inevitable trend
of events here unless drastic measures were interposed by the
Church. I had even lectured on it in my classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop is a man of very narrow vision,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;.
&ldquo;He rebuked me severely and truculantly bade me confine my
attention to the particular work assigned me and let affairs
of politics alone. Of course, that meant leaving them to his
assistant, Wenceslas. Mr. Hitt, Colombia needs a Luther!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; returned the explorer gravely. &ldquo;Priestcraft
from the very earliest times has been one of the greatest curses
of mankind. Its abuses date far back to Egyptian times, when
even prostitution was countenanced by the priests, and when
they practiced all sorts of impostures upon the ignorant masses.
In the Middle Ages they turned Christianity, the richest of
blessings, into a snare, a delusion, a rank farce. They arrogated
to themselves all learning, all science. In Peru it was
even illicit for any one not belonging to the nobility to attempt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page115' name='book1_page115'></a>115</span>
to acquire learning. That was the sole privilege of priests and
kings. In all nations, from the remotest antiquity, and whether
civilized or not, learning has been claimed by the priests as
the unique privilege of their caste&ndash;&ndash;a privilege bestowed upon
them by the special favor of the ruling deity. That&rsquo;s why they
always sought to surround their intellectual treasures with a
veil of mystery. Roger Bacon, the English monk, once said
that it was necessary to keep the discoveries of the philosophers
from those unworthy of knowing them. How did he expect a
realization of &lsquo;Thy kingdom come,&rsquo; I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t expect it to come&ndash;&ndash;on earth,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They relegated that to the imagined realm which was
to be entered through the gateway of death. It&rsquo;s mighty convenient
to be able to relegate your proofs to that mysterious
realm beyond the grave. That has always been a tremendous
power in the hands of priests of all times and lands. By the
way, did you know that the story of Abel&rsquo;s assassination was
one of many handed down, in one form or another, by the
priests of India and Egypt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; inquired Jos&egrave; eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. The story doubtless comes from the ancient
Egyptian tale which the priests of that time used to relate
regarding the murder of Osiris by his brother, Set. It was a
deed of jealousy. The story later became incorporated into the
sacred books of India and Egypt, and was afterward taken over
by the Hebrews, when they were captives in Egypt. The Hebrews
learned much of Egyptian theology, and their own religion
was greatly tinctured by it subsequently. The legend
of the deluge, for example, is another tradition of those primitive
days, and credited by the nations of antiquity. But here
there is the likelihood of a connection with the great cataclysm
of antiquity, the disappearance of the island of Atlantis in
consequence of a violent earthquake and volcanic action. This
alleged island, supposed to be a portion of the strip at one time
connecting South America with Africa, is thought to have
sunk beneath the waters of the present Atlantic ocean some
nine thousand years before Solon visited Egypt, and hence,
some eleven thousand years ago. Anyway, the story of this
awful catastrophe got into the Egyptian records in the earliest
times, and was handed down to the Hebrews, who probably
based their story of the flood upon it. You see, there is a
foundation of some sort for all those legends in the book of
Genesis. The difficulty has been that humanity has for centuries
childishly accepted them as historical fact. For example,
the serpent story. Now in very primitive times the serpent
was the special emblem of Kneph, the creator of the world, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page116' name='book1_page116'></a>116</span>
was regarded as a sort of good genius. It is still so regarded by
the Chinese, who make of it one of their most beautiful symbols,
the dragon. Later it became the emblem of Set, the slayer
of Osiris; and after that it was looked upon with horror as the
enemy of mankind, the destroyer, the evil principle. Hence, in
Egypt, the Hebrew captives adopted the serpent as emblematical
of evil, and later used it in their scriptural records as the
evil genius that tempted Eve and brought about the fall of man.
And so all people whose religious beliefs are founded upon the
Hebrew Bible now look upon the serpent as the symbol of evil.
Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans thus regard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; gazed at the man with rapt interest. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; he
urged. &ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;the tree and the serpent
were worshiped all through eastern countries, from Scandinavia
to the Asiatic peninsula and down into Egypt. And, do you
know, we even find vestiges of such worship in America? Down
in Adams county, Ohio, on the banks of Brush creek, there is
a great mound, called the serpent mound. It is seven hundred
feet long, and greatly resembles the one in Glen Feechan, Argyleshire,
Scotland. It also resembles the one I found in the ancient
city of Tiahuanuco, whose ruins lie at an elevation of
some thirteen thousand feet above the Pacific ocean, on the
shores of Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian frontier. This ancient
city ages ago sent out colonists all over North and South
America. These primitive people believed that a serpent emitted
an egg from its mouth, and that the earth was born of that egg.
Now the serpent mound in Ohio has an egg in its mouth. What
is the logical inference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave;, his eyes wide with
astonishment.</p>
<p>Hitt laughed again in evident enjoyment of the priest&rsquo;s
wonder. Then he resumed: &ldquo;It has been established to my
entire satisfaction that the ancient Egyptians and the Mayas
of Central and South America used almost identical symbols.
And from all antiquity, and by all nations, the symbols of
the tree and serpent and their worship have been so closely
identified as to render it certain that their origin is the same.
What, then, are the serpent and tree of knowledge in the
Hebrew Bible but an outgrowth of this? The tree of life, of
civilization, of knowledge, was placed in the middle of the
land, of the &lsquo;garden,&rsquo; of the primitive country of the race,
Mayax. And the empire of the Mayas was situated between the
two great continents of North and South America. These
people spread out in all directions. They populated the then
existing island of Atlantis. And when the terrible earthquake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page117' name='book1_page117'></a>117</span>
occurred, whereby this island was sunk beneath the waves of
the Atlantic ocean, why, to these people the world had been
drowned! The story got to Egypt, to Chaldea, and to India.
Hence the deluge record of Genesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, these primitive people, how ancient are they?&rdquo; queried
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can form any adequate estimate,&rdquo; said Hitt in reply.
&ldquo;The wonderful city of Tiahuanuco was in ruins when Manco
Capac laid the foundations of the Inca empire, which was later
devastated by the Spaniards. And the Indians told the Spaniards
that it had been constructed by giants before the sun
shone in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astonishing!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Such facts as these&ndash;&ndash;if
facts they be&ndash;&ndash;relegate much of the Scriptural authority to
the realm of legend and myth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; returned the explorer. &ldquo;When the human
mind of this century forces itself to approach a subject without
prejudice or bias, and without the desire to erect or maintain
a purely human institution at whatever cost to world-progress,
then it finds that much of the hampering, fettering dogma of
mediaevalism now laid upon it by the Church becomes pure
fiction, without justifiable warrant or basis. Remember, the
Hebrew people gave us the Old Testament, in which they had
recorded for ages their tribal and national history, their poetry,
their beliefs and hopes, as well as their legends, gathered from
all sources. We have likewise the historical records of other
nations. But the Hebrew possessed one characteristic which
differentiated him from all other people. He was a monotheist,
and he saw his God in every thing, every event, every place.
His concept of God was his life-motif. This concept evolved
slowly, painfully, throughout the centuries. The ancient
Hebrew patriarchs saw it as a variable God, changeful, fickle,
now violently angry, now humbly repentant, now making contracts
with mankind, now petulantly destroying His own handiwork.
He was a God who could order the slaughter of innocent
babes, as in the book of Samuel; or He was a tender,
merciful Father, as in the Psalms. He could harden hearts,
wage bloody wars, walk with men &lsquo;in the cool of the day,&rsquo;
create a universe with His fist, or spend long days designing
and devising the material utensils and furniture of sacrifice to
be used in His own worship. In short, men saw in Him just
what they saw in themselves. They saw but their mental concept.
The Bible records humanity&rsquo;s changing, evolving concept
of God, of that &lsquo;something not ourselves which makes for
righteousness.&rsquo; And this concept gradually changed from the
magnified God-man of the Old Testament, a creature of human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page118' name='book1_page118'></a>118</span>
whims and passions, down to that held by the man of Nazareth,
a new and beautiful concept of God as love. This new concept
Jesus joyously gave to a sin-weary world that had utterly
missed the mark. But it cost him his earthly life to do it.
And the dark record of the so-called Christian Church, both
Protestant and Catholic, contains the name of many a one who
has paid the same penalty for a similar service of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chaldeans and Egyptians,&rdquo; he went on, after a moment&rsquo;s
reflective pause, &ldquo;gave the Hebrews their account of the
creation of the universe, the fall of man, the flood, and many
other bits of mythical lore. And into these stories the Hebrews
read the activity of their God, and drew from them deep moral
lessons. Egypt gave the Hebrews at least a part of the story
of Joseph, as embodied in the hieroglyphics which may be
read on the banks of the Nile to-day. They probably also gave
the Hebrews the account of the creation found in the second
chapter of Genesis, for to this day you can see in some of the
oldest Egyptian temples pictures of the gods making men out
of lumps of clay. The discovery of the remains of the &lsquo;Neanderthal
man&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Ape-man of Java&rsquo; now places the dawn
of human reason at a period some three to five hundred thousand
years prior to our present century, and, combined with the
development of the science of geology, which shows that the
total age of the earth&rsquo;s stratified rocks alone cannot be much
less than fifty-five millions of years, serves to cast additional
ridicule upon the Church&rsquo;s present attitude of stubborn adherence
to these prehistoric scriptural legends as literal, God-given
fact. But, to make the right use of these legends&ndash;&ndash;well,
that is another thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explorer hesitated. &ldquo;I find it difficult to explain,&rdquo; he
said at length. &ldquo;But, remember what I have already said, there
is, there <i>must</i> be, a foundation beneath all these legends which
admonish mankind to turn from evil to good. And, as I also
said, that foundation must be very broad. I have said that I
was in search of a religion. Why not, you may ask, accept the
religious standard which Jesus set? That was the new concept
of God as love. Very good. I am quite convinced that love is
<i>the</i> religion, <i>the</i> tie which binds all things together and to a
common source and cause. And I am equally convinced that
Jesus is the only person recorded in history who ever lived a
life of pure reflection of the love which he called God. And
so you see why I am chipping and hewing away at the theological
conception of the Christ, and trying to get at the reality
buried deep beneath in the theological misconceptions of the
centuries. I am quite convinced that if men loved one another,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page119' name='book1_page119'></a>119</span>
as Jesus bade them do, all war, strife, disease, poverty, and
discord of every sort would vanish from human experience.
But&ndash;&ndash;and here is a serious question&ndash;&ndash;did Jesus ask the impossible?
Did he command us to love the sinful, erring mortal whom
we see in our daily walk&ndash;&ndash;or did he&ndash;&ndash;did he have a new
thought, namely, that by loving the real man, for which, perhaps,
this human concept stands in the human mind, <i>that
this very act would change that distorted concept and cause it
to yield its place to the real one</i>? I believe Jesus to have been
the wisest man who ever trod this earth. But I likewise believe
that no man has ever been more deplorably misunderstood,
misquoted, and misinterpreted than he. And so I am delving
down, down beneath the mass of human conjecture and ridiculous
hypothesis which the Church Fathers and our own theologians
have heaped up over this unique character, if perchance
I may some day discover just what he was, just what he really
said, and just what the message which he sought to convey to
mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned over and laid a hand on Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;My young
friend,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I believe there are meanings in the
life and words of Jesus of which the Church in its astounding
self-sufficiency has never even dreamed. Did he walk on the
water? Did he feed the multitude with a few loaves? Did he
raise Lazarus? Did he himself issue from the tomb? No more
momentous questions were ever asked than these. For, if so,
<i>then the message of Jesus has a bearing on the material universe,
on the human mind, and the whole realm of thought that
is utterly revolutionary</i>! What was that message? Did the
man&rsquo;s own apostles and immediate followers understand it?
Did Paul? Certain we are, however, that the theology which
Rome gave to her barbarian conquerors was wholly different
from that taught by Jesus and his disciples. And we know
that the history of Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire
down to the Franco-Prussian war is largely a recital of the
development of the religious beliefs which Rome handed down
to her conquerors, and their influence upon the human mind.
These beliefs constitute the working hypothesis of that institution
known to-day as the Holy Roman Catholic Church, and its
separated offshoots, the Greek Catholic and the Protestant
Churches, including the numberless ramifications and divisions
of the latter. The question as to whether eternal salvation is a
function of complete immersion of the human body, or only a
gentle sprinkling, appears most lamentably puerile in the face
of the tremendous revolutionary truths hinted by the deeds of
Jesus, assuming that he has been correctly reported in the
Gospels. No; Renan, in his <i>Vie de J&eacute;sus</i>, which I gave you last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page120' name='book1_page120'></a>120</span>
night, missed it. Before him, Voltaire and countless other
critics of man-made theology missed it. The writings of these
men do serve, however, to mow down the theological stubble in
the world&rsquo;s field of thought. What is it, this gigantic truth
which Jesus brought? I do not know. But he himself is reported
to have said, &lsquo;If ye keep my commands, ye shall know
of the doctrine.&rsquo; And his chief command was, <i>that we love
God and our fellow-men</i>. I have no doubt whatever that, when
we follow this command, we shall know of the doctrine which
he came to establish in the hearts of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his message was the brotherhood of man,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the explorer, &ldquo;it was the <i>fatherhood</i> of God,
rather. For that includes the brotherhood of man. But, while
we agree thus far, who can say what the fatherhood of God
implies? Who, realizing that this was Jesus&rsquo; message, knows
how to make it practical, as he did? To him it meant&ndash;&ndash;ah,
what did it not mean! It meant a consciousness that held
<i>not one trace of evil</i>. It meant a consciousness of God as
omnipotent power, the irresistible power of good, which, in
the form of spirit, or mind, as some will have it, is ever
present. Is it not so? Well, then, who is there to-day, within
the Church or without, who understands the divine message
of the fatherhood of God sufficiently to acquire such a consciousness,
and to make the intensely practical application of
the message to every problem of mind, or body, or environment?
Who to-day in your Church or mine, for example,
realizes that Jesus must have seen something in matter far
different from the solid, indestructible thing that we think we
see, and that this was due to his understanding of the immanence
of his Father as spirit&ndash;&ndash;an understanding which enabled
him to walk on the waves, and to treat material things as if
they were not? No, my friend, the Christ-message of the
fatherhood of God is hardly apprehended in the world to-day
in the slightest degree by priest or prelate, church or sect.
And yet, the influence of Jesus is tremendous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s brow knit in perplexity. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t believe I follow
you, quite,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; replied the explorer gently. &ldquo;I sometimes
wonder if I understand myself just what it is that I am
trying to express. My belief is still in a state of transition. I
am still searching. The field has been cleared. And now&ndash;&ndash;now
I am waiting for the new seed. I have abandoned forever the
sterile, non-productive religious beliefs of current theology.
I have abandoned such belittling views of God as the Presbyterian
sublapsarian view of election. I have turned wearily from
the puerile dogma of your Church as unworthy of the Father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page121' name='book1_page121'></a>121</span>
of Jesus. From delving into the mysteries of the Brahminism
of India, of ancestor-worship in Japan, of Confucianism in
China, of Islamism in the far East, I have come back to the
wonderful man of Nazareth. And now I am trying to see what
Christianity would be if purged of its adulterations&ndash;&ndash;purged
of the Greek philosophy of the early Fathers; of the forgeries
of the Middle Ages; of the pagan ceremonialism and priestly
rites and assumptions of power to save or damn in this present
century. And what do I find, after all this rubbish has been
filtered out? Love, friend&ndash;&ndash;love; the unfathomable love of the
Father of Jesus, who knows no evil, no sin, no sickness, no
death, no hell, no material heaven, but whose kingdom is the
harmonious realm of spirit, or mind, wherein the individual
consciousness knows no discord of any name or nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon haze had been long gathering when Jos&egrave;
roused the sleeping <i>cochero</i> and prepared to return to the
stifling ecclesiastical atmosphere from which for a brief day he
had been so happily free. A cold chill swept over him when
he took his seat in the carriage, and he shuddered as if with
an evil presentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you still adhere to your determination to remain in
the Church?&rdquo; his friend asked, as they turned from the green
hills and nodding palms of Turbaco, and set their course, toward
the distant mediaeval city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the scarcely audible reply. But as Jos&egrave; spoke,
he knew that his mind had that day been stripped of its last
remaining vestige of the old theology, leaving it bare, exposed&ndash;&ndash;and
receptive.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A week passed. The explorer had gone, as silently and unannounced
as he had come. The evening before his departure
he and Jos&egrave; had sat again in the thick shadows of the old wall.
The next morning he was on the mighty river; and the priest
was left with a great void in his heart.</p>
<p>One noon, as Jos&egrave; was returning from his classes, he pondered
deeply the last words of the explorer, &ldquo;Remember, nothing
that has been invented by mankind or evolved by the
human mind can stand, or remain. We might just as well
accept that great fact now as later, and adjust ourselves to it.
But the things of the spirit remain. And Paul has told us
what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he passed slowly along the winding little street toward
the dormitory, a messenger approached him with a summons
from the Bishop. He turned and started wonderingly toward
the Cathedral. He had been reprimanded once, twice, for the
liberal views which he had expressed to his classes. Was he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page122' name='book1_page122'></a>122</span>
to receive another rebuke now? He had tried to be more
careful of late. Had he been seen with the explorer?</p>
<p>An hour later, his eyes set and unseeing, and his thin lips
trembling, Jos&egrave; dragged himself up the stone steps to his little
room and threw himself upon the bed. The bonds which had
been slowly, imperceptibly tightening during these few months
of precious liberty had been drawn suddenly taut. The Bishop,
in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of <i>Inquisitor Natus</i>, had just revealed a full knowledge
of his dismal past, and had summarily dismissed him from
the University faculty. Jos&egrave;, bewildered and stunned, had
tried vainly to defend himself. Then, realizing his impotence
before the uncompromising bigotry of this choleric ecclesiastic,
he had burst suddenly into a torrent of frenzied declarations of
his undeserved wrongs, of his resolve now to renounce his
oath, to leave the Church, to abandon honor, family, everything
that held or claimed him, and to flee into unknown and unknowing
parts, where his harassed soul might find a few years
of rest before its final flight! The Bishop became bitterly and
implacably infuriated, and remanded the excited priest to his
room to reflect upon his wild words, and to await the final disposition
of his case&ndash;&ndash;unless he should have determined already
to try the devious route of apostasy.</p>
<p>Rising the next morning at dawn from the chill floor where
he had spent the torturing hours of an interminable night, and
still clinging forlornly to his battered sense of honor and
family pride, Jos&egrave; again received the Bishop&rsquo;s summons; and,
after the events of the morning already related, faced the angry
churchman&rsquo;s furious tirade, and with it, what he could not
have imagined before, a charge of hideous immorality. Then
had been set before him a choice between apostasy and acceptance
of the assignment to the parish of far-off Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, unpitying Fate,&rdquo; he murmured, as the door of
the Bishop&rsquo;s <i>sanctum</i> closed behind him, and he wandered
down through the gloom of the quiet Cathedral, &ldquo;receive your
victim. You have chosen well your carnal instruments&ndash;&ndash;pride&ndash;&ndash;ecclesiasticism&ndash;&ndash;lust!
My crimes? Aye, the very lowest;
for I have loved liberty of thought and conscience; I have
loved virtue and honor; the pursuits of intellect; the fair; the
noble; yea, the better things of life. I have loved my fellow-men;
and I have sought their emancipation from the thraldom
of ignorance. I have loved truth, and the Christ who revealed
it to the dull minds of mortals. Enough! I stand convicted!
And&ndash;&ndash;I accept the sentence&ndash;&ndash;I have no desire to resist it. For
the end is now not distant!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>
</div>
<p>The tropical moon shone in her fullness from an unclouded
sky. Through the ethereal atmosphere which bathed the
storied city her beams fell, plashing noiselessly upon the
grim memorials of a stirring past. With a mantle of peace
they gently covered the former scenes of violence and strife.
With magic, intangible substance they filled out the rents in
the grassy walls and smoothed away the scars of battle. The
pale luster, streaming through narrow barbican and mildewed
arch, touched the decaying ruin of San Felipe with the wand of
enchantment, and restored it to pristine freshness and strength.
Through the stillness of night the watery vapor streamed upward
from garden and <i>patio</i>, and mingled with the scent of
flushing roses and tropical buds in a fragrant mist suffused
with the moon&rsquo;s yellow glow.</p>
<p>On the low parapet bordering the eastern esplanade of the
city wall the solitary figure of the priest cast a narrow shadow
in the pale moonlight. The sounds which eddied the enveloping
silence seemed to echo in his ears the tread of mediaeval
warriors. In the wraith-like shadows he saw the armored
forms of <i>Conquistadores</i> in mortal strife with vulpine buccaneers.
In the whirring of the bats which flouted his face he
heard the singing of arrows and the hiss of hurled rocks. In
the moan of the ocean as it broke on the coral reef below
sounded the boom of cannon, the curses of combatants, and
the groans of the dying. Here and there moved tonsured
monks, now absolving in the name of the peaceful Christ the
frenzied defenders of the Heroic City, now turning to hurl
curses at the swarming enemy and consign their blackened
souls to deepest hell, while holding images of the crucified
Saviour to the quivering lips of stricken warriors.</p>
<p>In the fancied combat raging in the moonlight before him
he saw the sons of the house of Rinc&oacute;n manifesting their
devotion to Sovereign and Pope, their unshaken faith in Holy
Church, their hot zeal which made them her valiant defenders,
her support, her humble and devoted slaves for more than
three centuries.</p>
<p>What was the charm by which she had held them? And
why had its potency failed utterly when directed to him? But
they were men of physical action, not thought&ndash;&ndash;men of deeds
which called only for brave hearts and stout bodies. It is
true, there had been thinkers in those days, when the valiant
sons of Rinc&oacute;n hurled the enemy from Cartagena&rsquo;s walls&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page124' name='book1_page124'></a>124</span>
they lay rotting in dungeons&ndash;&ndash;they lay broken on the rack,
or hung breathing out their souls to God amid the hot flames
which His self-appointed vicars kindled about them. The
Rinc&oacute;ns of that day had not been thinkers. But the centuries
had finally evolved from their number a man of thought.
Alas! the evolution had developed intellect, it is true&ndash;&ndash;but the
process had refined away the rugged qualities of animal
strength which, without a deeper hold on Truth and the way
to demonstrate it than Jos&egrave; possessed, must leave him the plaything
of Fate.</p>
<p>Young in years, but old in sorrow; held by oaths which his
ever-accusing sense of honor would not let him break; trembling
for his mother&rsquo;s sake, and for the sake of Rinc&oacute;n pride,
lest the ban of excommunication fall upon him; yet little dreaming
that Rome had no thought of this while his own peculiar
elements of character bound him as they did to her; the man
had at last yielded his life to the system which had wrecked it
in the name of Christ, and was now awaiting the morrow,
when the boat should bear him to far-off Simit&iacute;. He went
resignedly&ndash;&ndash;even with a dull sense of gladness&ndash;&ndash;for he went
to die. Life had yielded him nothing&ndash;&ndash;and constituted as he
was, it could hold nothing for him in the future.</p>
<p>The glorious moon poured its full splendor upon the quiet
city. Through the haze the convent on La Popa sparkled like
an enchanted castle, with a pavement of soft moonbeams leading
up to its doors. The trill of a distant nightingale rippled
the scented air; and from the <i>llanos</i> were borne on the warm
land breeze low feral sounds, broken now and then by the
plaintive piping of a lonely toucan. The cocoa palms throughout
the city stirred dreamily in the tempered moonlight; and
the banana trees, bending with their luscious burden, cast
great, mysterious shadows, wherein insect life rustled and
scampered in nocturnal activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s voice called from below. The priest leaned over
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Catalina. I have been hunting everywhere. Maria is
calling for you. She cannot live long. You will come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come? Yes&ndash;&ndash;ah, why did he let his own misery blind him
to the sorrow of others even more unfortunate! Why had he
forgotten the little Maria! Descending the broad incline to the
road below, Jos&egrave; hurried with the woman to the bedside of the
dying girl. On the way the warm-hearted, garrulous Catalina
relieved her troubled and angered soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Lorenzo came this morning. He would not shrive
her unless we would pay him first. He said he would do it for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page125' name='book1_page125'></a>125</span>
ten <i>pesos</i>&ndash;&ndash;then five&ndash;&ndash;and then three. And when we kept
telling him that we had no money he told us to go out and
borrow it, or he would leave the little Maria to die as she was.
He said she was a vile sinner anyway&ndash;&ndash;that she had not made
her Easter duty&ndash;&ndash;that she could not have the Sacrament&ndash;&ndash;and
her soul would go straight to hell&ndash;&ndash;and there was no redemption!
Then he came again this afternoon and said she must
die; but he would shrive her for two <i>pesos</i>. And when we told
him we could not borrow the money he was terribly angry, and
cursed&ndash;&ndash;and Marcelena was frightened&ndash;&ndash;and the little Maria
almost died. But I told him to go&ndash;&ndash;that her little soul was
whiter than his&ndash;&ndash;and if he went to heaven I didn&rsquo;t want Maria
to go there too&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s words burned through the priest&rsquo;s ears and
into his sickened soul. Recovering her breath, Catalina
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a few days ago that the little Maria meets Sister
Isabel in the <i>plaza</i>. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says Sister Isabel, &lsquo;you are going to
be a mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Sister,&rsquo; answers the little Maria, much confused;
and she tries to hide behind Marcelena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is very dangerous and you will suffer much unless you
have a sacred cord of Saint Frances,&rsquo; says the Sister. &lsquo;I will
bring you one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then she asks where the little Maria lives; and that
very day she brings a piece of rope, with knots in it, which
she says the priest has blessed, and it is a sacred cord of Saint
Frances, and if the little Maria will wear it around her waist
she will not suffer at the parturition; and the little Maria must
pay a <i>peso oro</i> for it&ndash;&ndash;and the scared little lamb paid it, for
she had saved a little money which Don Carlos Ojeda gave her
for washing&ndash;&ndash;and she wore it when the babe was born; but
it didn&rsquo;t help her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Marcelena had paid a <i>peso y medio</i>,&rdquo; continued the
excited woman, &ldquo;for a candle that Sister Natalia told her had
come from the altar of the Virgin of Santander and was very
holy and would help one through confinement. But the
candle went out; and it was only a round stick of wood with a
little piece of candle on the end. And I&ndash;&ndash;Padre, I could not
help it, I would do anything for the poor child&ndash;&ndash;I paid two
<i>pesos oro</i> for a new <i>escapulario</i> for her. Sister Natalia said it
was very holy&ndash;&ndash;it had been blessed by His Grace, the Bishop,
just for women who were to be mothers, and it would carry
them through&ndash;&ndash;but if they died, it would take them right out of
purgatory&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page126' name='book1_page126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Catalina!&rdquo; interrupted the tortured priest. &ldquo;Say no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, the babe,&rdquo; the woman persisted. &ldquo;What will
become of it? And&ndash;&ndash;do you know?&ndash;&ndash;Padre Lorenzo says <i>it is
yours!</i> He told Juanita so&ndash;&ndash;she lives below us. But Maria
says no. She has told only Marcelena&ndash;&ndash;and Marcelena will
never tell. Who is its father, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest, recognizing the inevitable, patiently resigned
himself to the woman&rsquo;s talk without further reply. Presently
they turned into the Calle Lazano, and entering the house
where Marcelena had greeted him that morning, mounted to
the chamber above where lay the little Maria.</p>
<p>A single candle on a table near the head of the bed shed a
flickering, uncertain light. But the window was open, and the
moon&rsquo;s beams poured into the room in golden profusion. Aside
from the girl, there were no other occupants than Marcelena
and the new-born child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; murmured the passing girl, &ldquo;you will not let me
die without the Sacrament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child,&rdquo; replied the priest, bending over her, hot tears
streaming down his cheeks as she kissed his hand.</p>
<p>The girl had been beautiful, a type of that soft, southern
beauty, whose graces of form, full, regular features, and rich
olive tint mark them as truly Spanish, with but little admixture
of inferior blood. Her features were drawn and set now;
but her great, brown eyes which she raised to the priest were
luminous with a wistful eagerness that in this final hour became
sacred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marcelena,&rdquo; the priest hurriedly whispered to the woman.
&ldquo;I have no&ndash;&ndash;but it matters not now; she need not know that
I come unprepared. She must pass out of the world happy
at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a drop of wine that the doctor left; and I will
fetch a bit of bread,&rdquo; replied the woman, catching the meaning
of the priest&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring it; and I will let her confess now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending over the sinking girl, the priest bade her reveal
the burden resting on her conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carita</i>,&rdquo; he said tenderly, when the confession was ended,
&ldquo;fear not. The blessed Saviour died for you. He went to
prepare a place for you and for us all. He forgave the sinful
woman&ndash;&ndash;<i>carita</i>, he forgives you&ndash;&ndash;yes, freely, gladly. He loves
you, little one. Fear not what Padre Lorenzo said. He is a
sinful priest. Forget all now but the good Saviour, who stands
with open arms&ndash;&ndash;with a smile on his beautiful face&ndash;&ndash;to welcome
his dear child&ndash;&ndash;his little girl&ndash;&ndash;you, <i>carita</i>, you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;my babe?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page127' name='book1_page127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, it shall be cared for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not by the Sisters&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;excitedly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;not in an asylum&ndash;&ndash;Padre,
promise me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, <i>carita</i>, it shall be as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will care for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, child?&ndash;&ndash;ah, yes, I will care for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sank back again with a smile of happiness. A
deep silence fell upon the room. At the feet of the priest
Catalina huddled and wept softly. Marcelena, in the shadow of
the bed where she might not be seen, rocked silently back and
forth with breaking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;you will&ndash;&ndash;say Masses for me?&rdquo; The words were
scarcely audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>carita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;have no money&ndash;&ndash;no money. He promised to give me&ndash;&ndash;money&ndash;&ndash;and
clothes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, <i>carita</i>, I will say Masses for you without money&ndash;&ndash;every
day, for a year. And you shall have clothes&ndash;&ndash;ah, carita,
in heaven you shall have everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The candle sputtered, and went out. The moon flooded
the room with ethereal radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;lift me up&ndash;&ndash;it grows dark&ndash;&ndash;oh, Padre, you are so
good to me&ndash;&ndash;so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child, it is not I who am good to you, but the blessed
Christ. See him, <i>carita</i>&ndash;&ndash;there&ndash;&ndash;there in the moonlight he
stands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smoke from a neighboring chimney drifted slowly past
the window and shone white in the silvery beams. The girl,
supported by the arm of the priest, gazed at it through dimming
eyes in reverent awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it is the Saviour! Pray to him
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo; And turning toward the window the priest
extended his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Saviour,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;this is one of thy stricken
lambs, lured by the wolf from the fold. And we have brought
her back. Dost thou bid her come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sobs of the weeping woman at his feet floated through
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, thou tender and pitying Master&ndash;&ndash;best friend of the
sinning, the sick, and the sorrowing&ndash;&ndash;we offer to thee this
bruised child. We find no sin, no guile, in her; for after the
ignorant code of men she has paid the last farthing for satisfying
the wolf&rsquo;s greed. Dost thou bid her come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the presence of death he felt his own terrible impotence.
Of what avail then was his Christianity? Or the Church&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page128' name='book1_page128'></a>128</span>
traditional words of comfort? The priest&rsquo;s tears fell fast. But
something within&ndash;&ndash;perhaps that &ldquo;something not ourselves&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
voice of Israel&rsquo;s almost forgotten God&ndash;&ndash;whispered a hope
that blossomed in this petition of tenderest love and pity. He
had long since ceased to pray for himself; but in this, the
only prayer that had welled from his chilled heart in months,
his pitying desire to humor the wishes of a dying girl had unconsciously
formulated his own soul&rsquo;s appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Saviour, take her to thine arms; shield her forever
more from the carnal lust of the wolf; lift her above the
deadening superstitions and hypocritical creeds of those who
touch but to stain; take her, Saviour, for we find her pure,
innocent, clean; suffering and sorrow have purged away the
sin. Dost thou bid her come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scent of roses and orange blossoms from the garden
below drifted into the room on the warm breeze. A bird,
awakened by the swaying of its nest, peeped a few sweet notes
of contentment, and slept again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would save her&ndash;&ndash;we would cure her&ndash;&ndash;but we, too, have
strayed from thee and forgotten thy commands&ndash;&ndash;and the
precious gift of healing which thou didst leave with men has
long been lost. But thou art here&ndash;&ndash;thy compassionate touch
still heals and saves. Jesus, unique son of God, behold thy
child. Wilt thou bid her come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What says he, Padre?&rdquo; murmured the sinking girl.</p>
<p>The priest bent close to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says come, <i>carita</i>&ndash;&ndash;come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a fluttering sigh the tired child sank back into the
priest&rsquo;s arms and dropped softly into her long sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>
</div>
<p>The twisted, turbid &ldquo;Danube of New Granada,&rdquo; under the
gentle guidance of its patron, Saint Mary Magdalene,
threads the greater part of its sinuous way through the
heart of Colombia like an immense, slow-moving morass. Born
of the arduous tropic sun and chill snows, and imbued by the
river god with the nomadic instinct, it leaps from its pinnacled
cradle and rushes, sparkling with youthful vigor, down
precipice and perpendicular cliff; down rocky steeps and jagged
ridges; whirling in merry, momentary dance in shaded basins;
singing in swirling eddies; roaring in boisterous cataracts, to
its mad plunge over the lofty wall of Tequendama, whence it
subsides into the dignity of broad maturity, and begins its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page129' name='book1_page129'></a>129</span>
long, wandering, adult life, which slowly draws to a sluggish
old age and final oblivion in the infinite sea. Toward the close
of its meandering course, long after the follies and excesses of
early life, it takes unto itself a consort, the beautiful Cauca;
and together they flow, broadening and deepening as life nears
its end; merging their destinies; sharing their burdens; until
at last, with labors ended, they sink their identities in the
sunlit Caribbean.</p>
<p>When the simple-minded <i>Conquistadores</i> first pushed their
frail cockleshells out into the gigantic embouchure of this tawny
stream and looked vainly for the opposite shore, veiled by the
dewy mists of a glittering morn, they unconsciously crossed
themselves and, forgetful for the moment of greed and rapine
and the lust of gold, stood in reverent awe before the handiwork
of their Creator. Ere the Spaniard had laid his fell curse
upon this ancient kingdom of the Chibchas, the flowering banks
of the Magdalena, to-day so mournfully characterized by their
frightful solitudes, were an almost unbroken village from the
present coast city of Barranquilla to Honda, the limit of navigation,
some nine hundred miles to the south. The cupidity of
the heartless, bigoted rabble from mediaeval slums which
poured into this wonderland late in the sixteenth century laid
waste this luxuriant vale and exterminated its trustful inhabitants.
Now the warm airs that sigh at night along the
great river&rsquo;s uncultivated borders seem still to echo the gentle
laments of the once happy dwellers in this primitive paradise.</p>
<p>Sitting in the rounded bow of the wretched riverine steamer
Honda, Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n gazed with vacant eyes upon the
scenery on either hand. The boat had arrived from Barranquilla
that morning, and was now experiencing the usual exasperating
delay in embarking from Calamar. He had just
returned to it, after wandering for hours through the forlorn
little town, tormented physically by the myriad mosquitoes,
and mentally by a surprising eagerness to reach his destination.
He could account for the latter only on the ground of complete
resignation&ndash;&ndash;a feeling experienced by those unfortunate souls
who have lost their way in life, and, after vain resistance to
molding circumstances, after the thwarting of ambitions, the
quenching of ideals, admit defeat, and await, with something of
feverish anticipation, the end. He had left Cartagena early that
morning on the ramshackle little train which, after hours of
jolting over an undulating roadbed, set him down in Calamar,
exhausted with the heat and dust-begrimed. He had not seen
the Bishop nor Wenceslas since the interview of the preceding
day. Before his departure, however, he had made provision
for the burial of the girl, Maria, and the disposal of her child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page130' name='book1_page130'></a>130</span>
This he did at his own expense; and when the demands of
doctor and sexton had been met, and he had provided Marcelena
with funds for the care of herself and the child for at
least a few weeks, his purse was pitiably light.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the straggling remnant of a sea breeze
drifted up the river and tempered the scorching heat. Then
the captain of the Honda drained his last glass of red rum in
the <i>posada</i>, reiterated to his political affiliates with spiritous
bombast his condensed opinion anent the Government, and
dramatically signaled the pilot to get under way.</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that Simit&iacute; lay somewhere behind the liana-veiled
banks of the great river, perhaps three hundred miles
from Cartagena, the priest knew nothing of his destination.
There were no passengers bound for the place, the captain had
told him; nor had the captain himself ever been there, although
he knew that one must leave the boat at a point called Badillo,
and thence go by canoe to the town in question.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s interest in Simit&iacute; was only such as one might
manifest in a prison to which he was being conveyed. And,
as a prisoner of the Church, he inwardly prayed that his remaining
days might be few. The blows which had fallen, one
after another, upon his keen, raw nerves had left him benumbed.
The cruel bruises which his faith in man had received
in Rome and Cartagena had left him listless, and without pain.
He was accepting the Bishop&rsquo;s final judgment mutely, for he
had already borne all that human nature could endure. His
severance from a life of faith and love was complete.</p>
<p>Nor could Jos&egrave; learn when he might hope to reach Badillo,
though he made listless inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; the captain had said, &ldquo;we never know
where to find the water. It is on the right to-day; on the left
to-morrow. There is low tide to-night; the morning may see it
ten feet higher. And Badillo&ndash;&ndash;<i>quien sabe</i>? It might be washed
away when we arrive.&rdquo; And he shrugged his shoulders in
complete disclaimer of any responsibility therefor.</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s words were not idle, for the channel of the
mighty river changes with the caprice of a maiden&rsquo;s heart.
With irresistible momentum the tawny flood rolls over the
continent, now impatiently ploughing its way across a great
bend, destroying plantations and abruptly leaving towns and
villages many miles inland; now savagely filching away the
soft loam banks beneath little settlements and greedily adding
broad acres to the burden of its surcharged waters. Mighty
giants of the forest, wrested from their footholds of centuries,
plunge with terrifying noise into the relentless stream; great
masses of earth, still cohering, break from their moorings and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page131' name='book1_page131'></a>131</span>
glide into the whirling waters, where, like immense islands,
they journey bobbing and tumbling toward the distant sea.</p>
<p>Against the strong current, whose quartzose sediment
tinkled metallically about her iron prow, the clumsy Honda
made slow headway. She was a craft of some two hundred
tons burden, with iron hull, stern paddle wheel, and corrugated
metal passenger deck and roof. Below the passenger deck,
and well forward on the hull, stood the huge, wood-burning
boiler, whose incandescent stack pierced the open space where
the gasping travelers were forced to congregate to get what air
they might. Midway on this deck she carried a few cabins at
either side. These, bare of furnishings, might accommodate
a dozen passengers, if the insufferable heat would permit them
to be occupied. Each traveler was obliged to supply his own
bedding, and likewise hammock, unless not too discriminating
to use the soiled cot provided. Many of those whose affairs
necessitated river travel&ndash;&ndash;and there was no other mode of
reaching the interior&ndash;&ndash;were content at night to wrap a light
blanket about them and lie down under their mosquito nets on
the straw mats&ndash;&ndash;<i>petates</i>&ndash;&ndash;with which every <i>peon</i> goes provided.
Of service, there was none that might be so designated.
A few dirty, half-dressed negro boys from the streets of Barranquilla
performed the functions of steward, waiting on table
with unwashed hands, helping to sling hammocks, or assisting
with the carving of the freshly killed beef on the slippery deck
below. Accustomed as he had been to the comforts of Rome,
and to the less elaborate though still adequate accommodations
which Cartagena afforded, Jos&egrave; viewed his prison boat with
sinking heart. Iron hull, and above it the glowing boiler; over
this the metal passenger deck; and above that the iron roof,
upon which the fierce tropical sun poured its flaming heat all
day; clouds of steam and vapor from the hot river enveloping
the boat&ndash;&ndash;had the Holy Inquisition itself sought to devise the
most refined torture for a man of delicate sensibilities like
Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, it could not have done better than send him
up the great river at this season and on that miserable craft,
in company with his own morbid and soul-corroding thoughts.</p>
<p>The day wore on; and late in the evening the Honda docked
at the pretentious town of Maganguey, the point of transfer
for the river Cauca. Like the other passengers, from whom he
had held himself reservedly aloof, Jos&egrave; gladly seized the opportunity
to divert his thoughts for a few moments by going
ashore. But the moments stretched into hours; and when he
finally learned that the boat would not leave until daybreak,
he lapsed into a state of sullen desperation which, but for the
Rinc&oacute;n stubbornness, would have precipitated him into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page132' name='book1_page132'></a>132</span>
dark stream. Aimlessly he wandered about the town, avoiding
any possible <i>rencontre</i> with priests, or with his fellow-passengers,
many of whom, together with the bacchanalian captain,
he saw in the various <i>cantinas</i>, making merry over rum and
the native <i>anisado</i>.</p>
<p>The moon rose late, bathing the whitewashed town in a
soft sheen and covering with its yellow veil the filth and
squalor which met the priest at every turn as he wandered
through its ill-lighted streets. Maganguey in plan did not
depart from the time-honored custom of the Spaniards, who
erected their cities by first locating the church, and then building
the town around it. So long as the church had a good location,
the rest of the town might shift for itself. Some of the
better buildings dated from the old colonial period, and had
tile roofs and red brick floors. Many bore scars received in
the internecine warfare which has raged in the unhappy
country with but brief intervals of peace since the days of
Spanish occupation. But most of the houses were of the
typical mud-plastered, palm-thatched variety, with dirt floors
and scant furniture. Yet even in many of these Jos&egrave; noted
pianos and sewing machines, generally of German make, at
which the housewife was occupied, while naked babes and
squealing pigs&ndash;&ndash;the latter of scarcely less value than the former&ndash;&ndash;fought
for places of preferment on the damp and grimy
floors.</p>
<p>Wandering, blindly absorbed in thought, into a deserted
road which branched off from one of the narrow streets on the
outskirts of the town, Jos&egrave; stumbled upon a figure crouching
in the moonlight. Almost before he realized that it was a
human being a hand had reached up and caught his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buen Padre!</i>&rdquo; came a thick voice from the mass, &ldquo;for the
love of the good Virgin, a few <i>pesos</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beggar&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a bandit! Ah, well; Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s purse was
light&ndash;&ndash;and his life of no value. So, recovering from his start,
he sought in his pockets for some <i>billetes</i>. But&ndash;&ndash;yes, he remembered
that after purchasing his river transportation in
Calamar he had carefully put his few remaining bills in his
trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>, I am sorry, but I have no money with me,&rdquo; he said
regretfully. &ldquo;But if you will come to the boat I will gladly
give you something there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the figure emitted a scream of rage, and broke into
a torrent of sulphurous oaths. &ldquo;<i>Na</i>, the Saints curse you
beggarly priests! You have no money, but you rob us poor
devils with your lies, and then leave us to rot to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>amigo</i>, did I not say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Jos&egrave; soothingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page133' name='book1_page133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Maldito!</i>&rdquo; shrilled the figure; &ldquo;may Joseph and Mary and
Jesus curse you! A million curses on you, <i>maldito</i>!&rdquo; Pulling
itself upward, the shapeless thing sank its teeth deep into the
priest&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>With a cry of pain the startled Jos&egrave; tore himself loose, his
hand dripping with blood. At the same time the figure fell
over into the road and its enveloping rags slipped off, disclosing
in the bright moonlight a loathsome, distorted face and elephantine
limbs, covered with festering sores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, recoiling. &ldquo;A leper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning swiftly from the hideous object, his brain awhirl
with the horrible nightmare, the priest fled blindly from the
scene. Nauseated, quivering with horror, with the obscene
ravings of the leper still ringing in his ears, he stumbled about
the town until daybreak, when the boat&rsquo;s shrieking whistle
summoned him to embark.</p>
<p>The second day on the river seemed to Jos&egrave; intolerable, as
he shifted about the creaking, straining tub to avoid the sun&rsquo;s
piercing rays and the heat which, drifting back from the hot
stack forward, enveloped the entire craft. There were but few
passengers, some half dozen men and two slatternly attired
women. Whither they were bound, he knew not, nor cared;
and, though they saluted him courteously, he studiously
avoided being drawn into their conversations. The emotional
appeal of the great river and its forest-lined banks did not at
first affect him. Yet he sought forgetfulness of self by concentrating
his thought upon them.</p>
<p>The massed foliage constituted an impenetrable wall on
either side. Everywhere his eyes met a maze of <i>lianas</i>, creeping
plants, begonias, and bizarre vegetable forms, shapes and
hues of which he had never before had any adequate conception.
Often he caught the glint of great, rare butterflies hovering
in the early sunlight which filtered through the interlaced
fronds and branches. Often when the boat hugged the bank
he saw indescribable buds and blossoms, and multicolored
orchids clinging to the drooping <i>bejucos</i> which festooned the
enormous trees. As the afternoon waned and the sun hung
low, the magic stillness of the solitude began to cast its spell
about him, and he could imagine that he was penetrating a
fairy-land. The vast stream, winding, broadening, ramifying
round wooded islets, throwing out long, dusky lagoons and
swampy arms, incessantly plying its numberless activities, at
length held him enraptured. As he brooded over it all, his
thought wandered back to the exploits of the intrepid Quesada
and his stalwart band who, centuries before, had forced their
perilous way along this same river, amid showers of poisoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page134' name='book1_page134'></a>134</span>
arrows from hostile natives, amid the assaults of tropical
storms and malarial fevers, to the plateau of Cundinamarca,
the home of the primitive Muiscas; and there gathering fresh
strength and inspiration, had pushed on to the site of Santa F&eacute;
de Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>A cry suddenly rang through the boat. &ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clang of the pilot&rsquo;s bell stopped the clumsy craft; but
not before the ragged little negro boy who had served at Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
table as steward had been swept far away by the rapid current.</p>
<p>The utmost confusion immediately prevailed. Every one
of the rabble rout of stokers, stewards, and stevedores lost his
wits and set up a frenzied yell. Some who remembered that
there was such a thing, tore at the ropes which held the single
lifeboat. But the boat had been put on for appearance&rsquo;s sake,
not for service, and successfully resisted all efforts at removal.
No one dared risk his life in attempted rescue, for the river
swarmed with crocodiles. There was vain racing, counseling
and gesticulating; but at length, the first wave of excitement
over, passengers and crew settled down to watch the outcome
of the boy&rsquo;s struggle for life, while the pilot endeavored to
turn the unwieldy steamer about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to put up a prayer for the youngster,
Padre,&rdquo; said a voice behind Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>The priest turned. The speaker was evidently a native
Colombian. Jos&egrave; had noticed him on the boat when he embarked
at Calamar, and surmised that he had probably come
up from Barranquilla.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent opportunity to try the merits of a prayer to
the Virgin, no? If she can fish us out of purgatory she ought
to pull this boy out of the river, eh?&rdquo; continued the speaker
with a cynical smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather trust to a canoe and a pair of stout arms
than a prayer at present,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave; with candor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Corriente!</i>&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;my way of thinking, exactly!
But if I had a good rifle now I&rsquo;d put that little fellow
out of his misery, for he&rsquo;s going down, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not unkindly said; and Jos&egrave; appreciated the man&rsquo;s
rude sentiment. Minutes passed in strained silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad was evidently weakening. The rapid, swirling current
continually frustrated his efforts to reach the shore.
Again the head went under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios!</i>&rdquo; Jos&egrave; exclaimed. &ldquo;Is there no help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus had walked the waves. Yet here his earthly representative,
trained in all the learning and culture of Holy Church
to be an <i>Alter Christus</i>, stood helplessly by and watched a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page135' name='book1_page135'></a>135</span>
child drown! God above! what avail religious creed and
churchly dogma? How impotent the beliefs of men in such
an hour! Could the Holy Father himself, with all his assumptions,
spiritual and temporal&ndash;&ndash;with all his power to loose from
sin and from the imaginary torments of purgatory&ndash;&ndash;save this
drowning boy?</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned away in bitterness of heart. As he did so a
murmur of awe arose from the spectators. The priest looked
again down the river. Impelled from below, the body of the
boy was hurled out of the water. Then, as it fell, it disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cayman!</i>&rdquo; gasped the horrified crew.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stood spellbound, as the ghastly truth dawned upon
him. A crocodile, gliding beneath the struggling lad, had tossed
him upward, and caught him in its loathsome jaws when he
fell. Then it had dragged him beneath the yellow waters,
where he was seen no more.</p>
<p>Life is held cheaply by the Magdalena negro&ndash;&ndash;excepting his
own. Shiftless and improvident child of the tropics, his animal
wants are readily satisfied by the fruits and fish which nature
provides for him so bountifully. Spiritual wants he has none&ndash;&ndash;until
calamity touches him and he thinks he is about to die.
Then witchcraft, charm, incantation, the priest&ndash;&ndash;anything that
promises help is hurriedly pressed into requisition to prolong
his useless existence. If he recovers, he forgets it all as hurriedly.
The tragedy which had just been enacted before the
Honda&rsquo;s crew produced a ripple of excitement&ndash;&ndash;a momentary
stirring of emotion&ndash;&ndash;and was then speedily forgotten, while
the boat turned and drove its way up-stream against the muddy
waters.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; could not forget. Nature had endowed him with a
memory which recorded as minutely and as lastingly as the
phonographic cylinder. The violent death of the boy haunted
him, and mingled with the recurrent memories of the sad passing
of the little Maria, and his own bitter life experience. Oh,
the mystery of it all! The tragedy of life! The sudden blighting
of hopes! The ruthless crushing of hearts! What did it
mean? Did this infinite variety of good and evil which we
call life unite to manifest an infinite Creator? Nay, for then
were God more wicked than the lowest sinner! Was evil as
real as good, and more powerful? Yes. Did love and the soul&rsquo;s
desire to be and do good count for nothing in the end? No;
for the end is death&ndash;&ndash;always death! And after that&ndash;&ndash;who
knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming to Banco, Padre,&rdquo; said the man who had
addressed Jos&egrave; before, rousing him from his doleful meditations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page136' name='book1_page136'></a>136</span>
and pointing to the lights of the distant town, now shimmering
through the gathering dusk.</p>
<p>As the boat with shrilly shrieking whistle drew near the
landing, a crowd hurriedly gathered on the bank to receive it.
Venders of guava jelly, rude pottery, and straw mats hastily
spread out their merchandise on the muddy ground and began
to dilate loudly on their merits. A scantily clad man held aloft
a rare leopard skin, which he vigorously offered for two <i>pesos</i>
gold. Slatternly women, peddling queer delectables of uncertain
composition, waved their thin, bare arms and shrilly advertised
their wares. Black, naked children bobbed excitedly
about; and gaunt dogs and shrieking pigs scampered recklessly
through the crowd and added to the general confusion. Here
and there Jos&egrave; could see dignified looking men, dressed in
white cotton, and wearing straw&ndash;&ndash;<i>jipijapa</i>&ndash;&ndash;hats. These were
merchants, patiently awaiting consignments which they had
perhaps ordered months before. Crazy, ramshackle dwellings,
perched unsteadily upon long, slender stilts, rose from the
water&rsquo;s edge; but substantial brick buildings of fair size, with
red-tile roofs and whitewashed walls, mingled at intervals with
the thatched mud huts and rude hovels farther within the town.
In a distant doorway he descried a woman nursing a babe at
one breast and a suckling pig at the other. Convention is rigid
in these Colombian river towns; but it is widely inclusive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ashore with me, Padre, and forget what is worrying
you,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s new acquaintance, taking him by the arm.
&ldquo;I have friends here&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hola!</i> Padre Diego Guillermo!&rdquo; he suddenly
called, catching sight of a black-frocked priest standing
in the crowd on the shore.</p>
<p>The priest addressed, a short, stout, coarse-featured man of
perhaps forty, waved back a vigorous salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; the man ejaculated, holding Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm and
starting down the gangplank. &ldquo;What new deviltry is the rogue
up to now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and the priest addressed as Diego embraced
warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Diego Guillermo Polo, I have the extreme honor to
present my friend, the eminent Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; ceremoniously waving
a hand toward Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n,&rdquo; supplied the latter, bowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rinc&oacute;n!&rdquo; murmured the priest Diego. Then, abruptly,
&ldquo;Of Cartagena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;, with awakened interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of Don Ignacio&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied promptly, and with a touch
of pride.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page137' name='book1_page137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! he owned much property&ndash;&ndash;many <i>fincas</i>&ndash;&ndash;about here;
and farther west, in the Guamoc&oacute; country, many mines, eh,
Don Jorge?&rdquo; exchanging a significant look with the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, glancing at the perspiring Honda, &ldquo;this
old tub is going to hang up here for the night. So do me the
honor, se&ntilde;ores, to visit my little cell, and we will fight the
cursed mosquitoes over a sip of red rum. I have some of very
excellent quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge bowed their acquiescence and followed
him up the muddy road. The cell referred to consisted of a
suite of several rooms, commodiously furnished, and looking
out from the second story of one of the better colonial houses
of the town upon a richly blooming interior <i>patio</i>. As the
visitors entered, a comely young woman who had just lighted
an oil-burning &ldquo;student&rdquo; lamp and placed it upon the center
table, disappeared into one of the more remote rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece,&rdquo; said the priest Diego, winking at Don Jorge
as he set out cigars and a <i>garraf&oacute;n</i> of Jamaica rum. &ldquo;I have
ordered a case of American beer,&rdquo; he continued, lighting a
cigar. &ldquo;But that was two months ago, and it hasn&rsquo;t arrived
yet. <i>Diablo!</i> but the good <i>m&eacute;dico</i> tells me I drink too much
rum for this very Christian climate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge swept the place with an appraising glance.
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he commented, as he poured himself a liberal libation
from the <i>garraf&oacute;n</i>. &ldquo;The Lord surely provides for His faithful
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Lord, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; laughed Padre Diego; &ldquo;still I
am daily rendering no small thanks to His Grace, Don Wenceslas,
future Bishop of Cartagena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And eminent services into the bargain, I&rsquo;ll venture,&rdquo; added
Don Jorge.</p>
<p>Padre Diego&rsquo;s eyes twinkled merrily. Jos&egrave; started. Then
even in this remote town the artful Wenceslas maintained his
agent!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our friend is neither drinking nor smoking,&rdquo; said
Padre Diego, turning inquiringly to Jos&egrave;, who had left his glass
untouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; replied the latter; &ldquo;I do not use
liquor or tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor women either, eh?&rdquo; laughed Padre Diego. &ldquo;<i>Por Dios!</i>
what is it the Dutchman says?</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&lsquo;Wer nicht liebt Wein, Weib und Gesang,<br />
Der bleibt ein Narr sein Lebenlang.&rsquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> but my German has all slipped from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; commented Don Jorge cynically; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ll
wager it took nothing good with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page138' name='book1_page138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> but you are hard on a loyal servant of the Lord,&rdquo;
exclaimed Padre Diego in a tone of mock injury, as he drained
another glass of the fiery liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Servant of the Lord!&rdquo; guffawed Don Jorge. &ldquo;Of the Lord
Pope, Lord Wenceslas, or the Lord God, may we ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qu&eacute; chiste!</i> Why, stupid, all three. I do not put all my
eggs into one basket, however large. But tell me, now,&rdquo; he
inquired, turning the conversation from himself, &ldquo;what is it
brings you into this region forsaken of the gods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sepulcros</i>,&rdquo; Don Jorge briefly announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Indian graves again! But have you abandoned your
quest of <i>La Tumba del Diablo</i>, in the Sinu valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, since the records show that it was opened centuries
ago. And I spent a good year&rsquo;s search on it, too! <i>Dios!</i>
They say it yielded above thirty thousand <i>pesos</i> gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am on the track of others. I go now to Medellin;
then to Remedios; and there outfit for a trip of grave hunting
through the old Guamoc&oacute; district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guamoc&oacute;! Then you will naturally come down the Simit&iacute;
trail, which brings you out to the Magdalena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;?&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave; eagerly, turning to the speaker.
&ldquo;Do you know the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhat!&rdquo; replied Padre Diego, laughing. &ldquo;I had charge
of that parish for a few months&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But found it highly convenient to leave, no?&rdquo; finished the
merciless Don Jorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> Would you have me die of <i>ennui</i> in such a hell-hole?&rdquo;
cried Diego with some aspersion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell-hole!&rdquo; echoed Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Is it so bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> Yes&ndash;&ndash;worse! They say that after the good Lord
created heaven and earth He had a few handfuls of dirt left,
and these He threw away. But crafty Satan, always with an
eye single to going the Lord one better, slyly gathered this dirt
together again and made Simit&iacute;.&rdquo; Diego quickly finished another
glass of rum, as if he would drown the memory of the
town.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart slowly sank under the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you ask? You are not going there?&rdquo; Padre
Diego inquired. Jos&egrave; nodded an affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i> Assigned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in a voice scarcely audible.</p>
<p>The Padre whistled softly. &ldquo;Then in that case,&rdquo; he said,
brightening, &ldquo;we are brother sinners. So let us exchange confidences.
What was your crime, if one may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crime!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave; in amazement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page139' name='book1_page139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Aye; who was she? Rich? Beautiful? Native? Or foreign?
Come, the story. We have a long night before us.&rdquo;
And the coarse fellow settled back expectantly in his chair.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; paled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked in a trembling
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; returned the Padre impatiently. &ldquo;You surely
know that no respectable priest is ever sent to Simit&iacute;! That
it is the good Bishop&rsquo;s penal colony for fallen clergy&ndash;&ndash;and, I
may add, the refuge of political offenders of this and adjacent
countries. Why, the present schoolmaster there is a political
outcast from Salvador!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not know it,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por Dios!</i> Then you are being jobbed, <i>amigo</i>! Did Don
Wenceslas give you letters to the Alcalde?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;by the way, has Wenceslas been misbehaving of
late?&ndash;&ndash;for when he does, somebody other than himself has to
settle the score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; mused Diego, &ldquo;but Don Wenceslas is artful. And
yet, I think I see the direction of his trained hand in this.&rdquo;
Then he burst into a rude laugh. &ldquo;Come, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; he said,
noting Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s dejected mien; &ldquo;let us have your story. We may
be able to advise. And we&rsquo;ve had experience&ndash;&ndash;eh, Don Jorge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; slowly shook his head. What mattered it now?
Simit&iacute; would serve as well to bury him as any other tomb. He
knew he was sent as a lamb to the slaughter. But it was his
affair&ndash;&ndash;and his God&rsquo;s. Honor and conscience had presented
the score; and he was paying in full. His was not a story to
be bandied about by lewd priests like Padre Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied to the Padre&rsquo;s insistent solicitations; &ldquo;with
your permission, we will talk of it no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre</i>!&rdquo; cried the Padre at last, in his coarse way
stirred by Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s evident truthfulness. &ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;as you wish&ndash;&ndash;I
will not pry into your secrets. But, take a bit of counsel from
one who knows: when you reach Simit&iacute;, inquire for a man who
hates me, one Rosendo Ariza&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture the Honda&rsquo;s diabolical whistle pierced the
murky night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; cried Don Jorge, starting up. &ldquo;Are they going
to try the river to-night?&rdquo; And the men hurried back to the
landing.</p>
<p>The moon was up, and the boat was getting under way.
Padre Diego went aboard to take leave of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, amigo</i>,&rdquo; he said to Don Jorge; &ldquo;I am sorry your stay
is so short. I had much to tell you. Interesting developments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page140' name='book1_page140'></a>140</span>
are forward, and I hope you are well out of Guamoc&oacute; when the
trouble starts. For the rivals of Antioquia and Simit&iacute; will pay
off a few scores in the next revolution&ndash;&ndash;a few left over from
the last; and it would be well not to get caught between them
when they come together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is coming?&rdquo; said Don Jorge thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming! <i>Hombre!</i> It is all but here! The Hercules went
up-river yesterday. You will pass her. She has gone to keep
a look-out in the vicinity of Puerto Berrio. I am sorry for our
friend,&rdquo; nodding toward Jos&egrave;, who was leaning over the boat&rsquo;s
rail at some distance; &ldquo;but there is a job there. He doesn&rsquo;t
belong in this country. And Simit&iacute; will finish him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! only another priest less&ndash;&ndash;and a weak-kneed one at
that,&rdquo; said Don Jorge with contempt; &ldquo;and we have too many
of them now, Lord knows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that I am a priest,&rdquo; chuckled Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! Yes, so you are,&rdquo; laughed Don Jorge; &ldquo;but of the
diocese of hell! Well, we&rsquo;re off. I&rsquo;ll send a runner down the
trail when I reach the Tigu&iacute; river; and if you will have a letter
in Simit&iacute; informing me of the status of things political, he can
bring it up. <i>Conque</i>, <i>adios</i>, my consummate villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Honda, whistling prodigiously, swung out into mid-stream
and set her course up-river, warily feeling through the
velvety darkness for the uncertain channel. Once she grated
over a hidden bar and hung for a few moments, while her stack
vomited torrents of sparks and her great wheel angrily churned
the water into creamy foam in the clear moonlight. Once,
rounding a sharp bend, she collided squarely with a huge mahogany
tree, rolling and plunging menacingly in the seaward
rushing waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i>&rdquo; muttered Don Jorge, as he helped Jos&egrave; swing his
hammock and adjust the mosquito netting. &ldquo;I shall offer a
candle a foot thick to the blessed Virgin if I reach Puerto
Berrio safely! <i>Santo Dios!</i>&rdquo; as the boat grazed another sand
bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tell of steamers hanging up on bars in this
river for six weeks! And look!&rdquo; pointing to the projecting
smoke-stack of a sunken steamer. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> That is what
we just escaped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; manifested slight interest in the dangers of river
navigation. His thoughts were revolving about the incidents
of the past few days, and, more especially, about Padre Diego
and his significant words. Don Jorge had volunteered no
further explanation of the man or his conversation; and Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
reticence would not permit him to make other inquiry. But,
after all, his thought-processes always evolved the same conclusion:
What mattered it now? His interest in life was at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page141' name='book1_page141'></a>141</span>
an end. He had not told Don Jorge of his experience with the
leper in Maganguey. He was trying to forget it. But his hand
ached cruelly; and the pain was always associated with loathsome
and repellant thoughts of the event.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The eastern sky was blushing at the approach of the amorous
sun when Jos&egrave; left his hammock and prepared to endure
another day on the river. To the south the deep blue vault of
heaven was dotted with downy clouds. Behind the laboring
steamer the river glittered through a dazzling white haze.
Ahead, its course was traceable for miles by the thin vapor
always rising from it. The jungle on either side was brilliant
with color and resonant with the songs of forest lyrists. In
the lofty fronds of venerable palms and cedars noisy macaws
gossiped and squabbled, and excited monkeys discussed the
passing boat and commented volubly on its character. In the
shallow water at the margin of the river blue herons and spindle-legged
cranes were searching out their morning meal. Crocodiles
lay dozing on the <i>playas</i>, with mouths opened invitingly
to the stupid birds which were sure to yield to the mesmerism.
Far in the distance up-stream a young deer was drinking at
the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>The charm of the rare scene held the priest spellbound. As
he gazed upon it a king vulture&ndash;&ndash;called by the natives the Vulture
Papa, or Pope Vulture&ndash;&ndash;suddenly swooped down from the
depths of heaven and, lighting upon the carcass of a monster
crocodile floating down the river, began to feast upon the choicest
morsels, while the buzzards which had been circling about
the carrion and feeding at will respectfully withdrew until the
royal appetite should be satiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy graft, eh, Padre?&rdquo; commented Don Jorge, coming up.
&ldquo;Those brainless buzzards, if they only knew it and had sense
enough to unite, could strip every feather off that swaggering
vulture and send him packing. Fools! And we poor Colombians,
if we had the courage, could as easily throw the Church
into the sea, holy candles, holy oils, holy incense and all!
<i>Diablo!</i> But we are fleeced like sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Jos&egrave; it did not seem strange that this man should speak
so frankly to him, a priest. He felt that Don Jorge was not so
much lacking in courtesy and delicate respect for the feelings
and opinions of others as he was ruggedly honest and fearlessly
sincere in his hatred of the dissimulation and graft practiced
upon the ignorant and unsuspecting. For the rest of the day
Don Jorge was busy with his maps and papers, and Jos&egrave; was
left to himself.</p>
<p>The character of the landscape had altered with the narrowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page142' name='book1_page142'></a>142</span>
of the stream, and the river-plain now lay in a great
volcanic basin flanked by distant verdure-clad hills. Far to the
southwest Jos&egrave; could see the faint outlines of the lofty <i>Cordilleras</i>.
Somewhere in that direction lay Simit&iacute;. And back of it
lay the ancient treasure house of Spain, where countless thousands
of sweating slaves had worn out their straining bodies
under the goad and lash, that the monarchs of Castile might
carry on their foolish religious wars and attempt their vain
projects of self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p>The day wore on without interest, and darkness closed in
quickly when the sun dropped behind the <i>Sierras</i>. It was to be
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s last night on the Magdalena, for the captain had told him
that, barring disaster, the next afternoon should find them at
Badillo. After the evening meal the priest took his chair to the
bow of the steamer and gave himself over to the gentle influences
of the rare and soothing environment. The churning of
the boat was softly echoed by the sleeping forest. The late moon
shimmered through clouds of murky vapor, and cast ghostly
reflections along the broad river. The balmy air, trembling
with the radiating heat, was impregnated with sweetest odors
from the myriad buds and balsamic plants of the dark jungle
wilderness on either hand, where impervious walls rose in
majestic, deterrant, awesome silence from the low shore line,
and tangled shrubs and bushes, rioting in wild profusion, jealously
hung to the water&rsquo;s edge that they might hide every trace
of the muddy banks. What shapes and forms the black depths
of that untrodden bush hid from his eyes, Jos&egrave; might only
imagine. But he felt their presence&ndash;&ndash;crawling, creeping things
that lay in patient ambush for their unwitting prey&ndash;&ndash;slimy
lizards, gorgeously caparisoned&ndash;&ndash;dank, twisting serpents&ndash;&ndash;elephantine
tapirs&ndash;&ndash;dull-witted sloths&ndash;&ndash;sleek, wary jaguars&ndash;&ndash;fierce
formicidae, poisonous and carnivorous. He might not
see them, but he felt that he was the cynosure of hundreds of
keen eyes that followed him as the boat glided close to the
shore and silently crept through the shadows which lay thick
upon the river&rsquo;s edge. And the matted jungle, with its colossal
vegetation, he felt was peopled with other things&ndash;&ndash;influences
intangible, and perhaps still unreal, but mightily potent with
the symbolized presence of the great Unknown, which stands
back of all phenomena and eagerly watches the movements of
its children. These influences had already cast their spell upon
him. He was yielding, slowly, to the &ldquo;lure of the tropics,&rdquo;
which few who come under its attachment ever find the strength
to dispel.</p>
<p>No habitations were visible on the dark shores. Only here
and there in the yellow glow of the boat&rsquo;s lanterns appeared the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page143' name='book1_page143'></a>143</span>
customary piles of wood which the natives sell to the passing
steamers for boiler fuel, and which are found at frequent intervals
along the river. At one of these the Honda halted to
replenish its supply. The usual bickering between the negro
owner and the boat captain resulted in a bargain, and the
half-naked stevedores began to transfer the wood to the vessel,
carrying it on their shoulders in the most primitive manner,
held in a strip of burlap. The rising moon had at last thrown
off its veil of murky clouds, and was shining in undimmed
splendor in a starry sky. Jos&egrave; went ashore with the passengers;
for the boat might remain there for hours while her crew labored
leisurely, with much bantering and singing, and no
anxious thought for the morrow.</p>
<p>The strumming of a <i>tiple</i> in the distance attracted him. Following
it, he found a small settlement of bamboo huts hidden
away in a beautiful grove of moriche palms, through which the
moonbeams filtered in silvery stringers. Little gardens lay back
of the dwellings, and the usual number of goats and pigs were
dozing in the heavy shadows of the scarcely stirring trees.
Reserved matrons and shy <i>doncellas</i> appeared in the doorways;
and curious children, naked and chubby, hid in their mothers&rsquo;
scant skirts and peeped cautiously out at the newcomers. The
tranquil night was sweet with delicate odors wafted from numberless
plants and blossoms in the adjacent forest, and with the
fragrance breathed from the roses, gardenias and dahlias with
which these unpretentious dwellings were fairly embowered.
A spirit of calm and peaceful contentment hovered over the
spot, and the round, white moon smiled down in holy benediction
upon the gentle folk who passed their simple lives in this
bower of delight, free from the goad of human ambition, untrammeled
by the false sense of wealth and its entailments,
and unspoiled by the artificialities of civilization.</p>
<p>One of the passengers suggested a dance, while waiting for
the boat to take on its fuel. The owner of the wood, apparently
the chief authority of the little settlement, immediately procured
a <i>tom-tom</i>, and gave orders for the <i>baile</i>. At his direction
men, women and children gathered in the moonlit clearing
on the river bank and, while the musician beat a monotonous
tattoo on the crude drum, circled about in the stately and dignified
movements of their native dance.</p>
<p>It was a picture that Jos&egrave; would not forget. The balmy air,
soft as velvet, and laden with delicious fragrance; the vast
solitude, stretching in trackless wilderness to unknown reaches
on either hand; the magic stillness of the tropic night; the figures
of the dancers weirdly silhouetted in the gorgeous moonlight;
with the low, unvaried beat of the <i>tom-tom</i> rising dully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page144' name='book1_page144'></a>144</span>
through the warm air&ndash;&ndash;all merged into a scene of exquisite
beauty and delight, which made an indelible impression upon
the priest&rsquo;s receptive mind.</p>
<p>And when the sounds of simple happiness had again died
into silence, and he lay in his hammock, listening to the spirit
of the jungle sighing through the night-blown palms, as the boat
glided gently through the lights and shadows of the quiet river,
his soul voiced a nameless yearning, a vague, unformed longing
for an approach to the life of simple content and child-like happiness
of the kind and gentle folk with whom he had been privileged
to make this brief sojourn.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The crimson flush of the dawn-sky heralded another day of
implacable heat. The emerald coronals of palms and towering
<i>caobas</i> burned in the early beams of the torrid sun. Light
fogs rose reluctantly from the river&rsquo;s bosom and dispersed in
delicate vapors of opal and violet. The tangled banks of dripping
bush shone freshly green in the misty light. The wilderness,
grim and trenchant, reigned in unchallenged despotism.
Solitude, soul-oppressing, unbroken but for the calls of feathered
life, brooded over the birth of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s last day on the Magdalena.
About midday the steamer touched at the little village
of Bodega Central; but the iron-covered warehouse and
the whitewashed mud hovels glittered garishly in the fierce heat
and stifled all desire to go ashore. The call was brief, and the
boat soon resumed its course through the solitude and heat of
the mighty river.</p>
<p>Immediately after leaving Bodega Central, Don Jorge approached
Jos&egrave; and beckoned him to an unoccupied corner of
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>,&rdquo; he began, after assuring himself that his words
would not carry to the other passengers, &ldquo;the captain tells me
the next stop is Badillo, where you leave us. If all goes well
you will be in Simit&iacute; to-night. No doubt a report of our meeting
with Padre Diego has already reached Don Wenceslas, who,
you may be sure, has no thought of forgetting you. I have no
reason to tell you this other than the fact that I think, as
Padre Diego put it, you are being jobbed&ndash;&ndash;not by the Church,
but by Wenceslas. I want to warn you, that is all. I hate
priests! They got me early&ndash;&ndash;got my wife and girl, too! I hate
the Church, and the whole ghastly farce which it puts over on
the ignorant people of this country! But&ndash;&ndash;,&rdquo; eying him sharply,
&ldquo;I would hardly class you as a <i>real</i> priest. There, never mind!&rdquo;
as Jos&egrave; was about to interrupt. &ldquo;I think I understand. You
simply went wrong. You meant well, but something happened&ndash;&ndash;as
always does when one means well in this world. But now
to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page145' name='book1_page145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>Shifting his chair closer to Jos&egrave;, the man resumed earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandfather, Don Ignacio, was a very rich man. The
war stripped him. He got just what he deserved. His <i>fincas</i>
and herds and mines melted away from him like grease from
a holy candle. And nobody cared&ndash;&ndash;any more than the Lord
cares about candle grease. Most of his property fell into the
hands of his former slaves&ndash;&ndash;and he had hundreds of them hereabouts.
But his most valuable possession, the great mine of
La Libertad, disappeared as completely as if blotted from the
face of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mine&ndash;&ndash;no, not a mine, but a mountain of free gold&ndash;&ndash;was
located somewhere in the Guamoc&oacute; district. After the war
this whole country slipped back into the jungle, and had to be
rediscovered. The Guamoc&oacute; region is to-day as unknown as it
was before the Spaniards came. Somewhere in the district,
but covered deep beneath brush and forest growth, is that
mine, the richest in Colombia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, as you know, Don Ignacio left this country in considerable
of a hurry. But I think he always intended to come
back again. Death killed that ambition. I don&rsquo;t know about
his sons. But the fact remains that La Libertad has never been
rediscovered since Don Ignacio&rsquo;s day. The old records in Cartagena
show the existence of such a mine in Spanish times, and
give a more or less accurate statement of its production.
<i>Diablo</i>! I hesitate to say how much! The old fellow had
<i>arrastras</i>, mills, and so on, in which slaves crushed the ore. The
bullion was melted into bars and brought down the trail to
Simit&iacute;, where he had agents and warehouses and a store or two.
From there it was shipped down the river to Cartagena. But
the war lasted thirteen years. And during that time everything
was in a state of terrible confusion. The existence of mines
was forgotten. The plantations were left unworked. The male
population was all but killed off. And the country sank back
into wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>; so much for history. Now to your friends on the
coast&ndash;&ndash;and elsewhere. Don Wenceslas is quietly searching for
that mine&ndash;&ndash;has been for years. He put his agent, Padre Diego,
in Simit&iacute; to learn what he might there. But the fool priest was
run out after he had ruined a woman or two. However, Padre
Diego is still in close touch with the town, and is on the keen
search for La Libertad. Wenceslas thinks there may be descendants
of some of Don Ignacio&rsquo;s old slaves still living in
Simit&iacute;, or near there, and that they know the location of the
lost mine. And, if I mistake not, he figures that you will learn
the secret from them in some way, and that the mine will again
come to light. Now, if you get wind of that mine and attempt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page146' name='book1_page146'></a>146</span>
to locate it, or purchase it from the natives, you will be beaten
out of it in a hurry. And you may be sure Don Wenceslas will
be the one who will eventually have it, for there is no craftier,
smoother, brighter rascal in Colombia than he. And so, take
it from me, if you ever get wind of the location of that famous
property&ndash;&ndash;which by rights is yours, having belonged to your
grandfather&ndash;&ndash;<i>keep the information strictly to yourself</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know Simit&iacute;. But I shall be working in the Guamoc&oacute;
district for many months to come, hunting Indian graves.
I shall have my runners up and down the Simit&iacute; trail frequently,
and may get in touch with you. It may be that you will need a
friend. There! The boat is whistling for Badillo. A last word:
Keep out of the way of both Wenceslas and Diego&ndash;&ndash;cultivate
the people of Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;and keep your mouth closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Jos&egrave; stood on the river bank beside his
little haircloth trunk and traveling bag, sadly watching the
steamer draw away and resume her course up-stream. He
watched it until it disappeared around a bend. And then he
stood watching the smoke rise above the treetops, until that,
too, faded in the distance. No one had waved him a farewell
from the boat. No one met him with a greeting of welcome on
the shore. He was a stranger among strangers.</p>
<p>He turned, with a heavy heart, to note his environment. It
was a typical riverine point. A single street, if it might be so
called; a half dozen bamboo dwellings, palm-thatched; and a
score of natives, with their innumerable gaunt dogs and porcine
companions&ndash;&ndash;this was Badillo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre.</i>&rdquo; A tall, finely built native, clad in soiled
white cotton shirt and trousers, approached and addressed him
in a kindly tone. &ldquo;Where do you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; replied the priest, turning eagerly to the man.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; in bewilderment, &ldquo;where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; answered the native, pointing to the jungle
on the far side of the river. &ldquo;Many leagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wearied priest sat down on his trunk and buried his
face in his hands. Faintness and nausea seized him. It was the
after-effect of his long and difficult river experience. Or, perhaps,
the deadly malaria was beginning its insidious poisoning.
The man approached and laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, why do you go to Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; raised his head and looked more closely at his interlocutor.
The native was a man of perhaps sixty years. His
figure was that of an athlete. He stood well over six feet high,
with massive shoulders, and a waist as slender as a woman&rsquo;s.
His face was almost black in color, and mottled with patches of
white, so common to the natives of the hot inlands. But there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page147' name='book1_page147'></a>147</span>
was that in its expression, a something that looked out through
those kindly black eyes, that assured Jos&egrave; and bespoke his
confidence.</p>
<p>The man gravely repeated his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been sent there by the Bishop of Cartagena. I am
to have charge of the parish,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied.</p>
<p>The man slowly shook his finely shaped head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want no priest in Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; he said with quiet firmness.
His manner of speaking was abrupt, yet not ungracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;do you live there?&rdquo; inquired Jos&egrave; anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must know a man&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo, I think his
name&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Rosendo Ariza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked eagerly at the man. Then he wearily stretched
out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;I am sick&ndash;&ndash;I think. And&ndash;&ndash;I have&ndash;&ndash;no friends&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo quickly grasped his hand and slipped an arm about
his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your friend, Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He stopped and appeared to
reflect for a moment. Then he added quickly, &ldquo;My canoe is
ready; and we must hurry, or night will overtake us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest essayed to rise, but stumbled. Then, as if he had
been a child, the man Rosendo picked him up and carried him
down the bank to a rude canoe, where he deposited him on a
pile of empty bags in the keel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escolastico!&rdquo; he called back to a young man who seemed
to be the chief character of the village. &ldquo;Sell the <i>panela</i> and
yuccas <i>&aacute; buen precio</i>; and remind Captain Julio not to forget
on the next trip to bring the little Carmen a doll from Barranquilla.
I will be over again next month. And Juan,&rdquo; addressing
the sturdy youth who was preparing to accompany
him, &ldquo;set in the Padre&rsquo;s baggage; and do you take the paddle,
and I will pole. <i>Conque, adioscito!</i>&rdquo; waving his battered straw
hat to the natives congregated on the bank, while Juan pushed
the canoe from the shore and paddled vigorously out into the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adioscito! adioscito! Don Rosendo y Juan!</i>&rdquo; The hearty
farewells of the natives followed the canoe far out into the broad
stream.</p>
<p>Across the open river in the livid heat of the early afternoon
the canoe slowly made its way. The sun from a cloudless sky
viciously poured down its glowing rays like molten metal. The
boat burned; the river steamed; the water was hot to his touch,
when the priest feebly dipped his hands into it and bathed his
throbbing brow. Badillo faded from view as they rounded a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page148' name='book1_page148'></a>148</span>
densely wooded island and entered a long lagoon. Here they
lost the slight breeze which they had had on the main stream.
In this narrow channel, hemmed in between lofty forest walls
of closely woven vines and foliage, it seemed to Jos&egrave; that they
had entered a flaming inferno. The two boatmen sat silent
and inscrutable, plying their paddles without speaking.</p>
<p>Down the long lagoon the canoe drifted, keeping within what
scant shade the banks afforded, for the sun stood now directly
overhead. The heat was everywhere, insistent, unpitying. It
burned, scalded, warped. The foliage on either side of the
channel merged into the hot waves that rose trembling about
them. The thin, burning air enveloped the little craft with
fire. Jos&egrave; gasped for breath. His tongue swelled. His pulse
throbbed violently. His skin cracked. The quivering appearance
of the atmosphere robbed him of confidence in his own
vision. A cloud of insects hung always before his sight. Dead
silence lay upon the scene. Not a sound issued from the jungle.
Not a bird or animal betrayed its presence. The canoe
was edging the Colombian &ldquo;hells,&rdquo; where even the denizens of
the forest dare not venture forth on the low, open <i>savannas</i> in
the killing heat of midday.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank down in the boat, wilting and semi-delirious.
Through his dimmed eyes the boatman looked like glowing inhuman
things set in flames. Rosendo came to him and placed
his straw hat over his face. Hours, interminable and torturing,
seemed to pass on leaden wings. Then Juan, deftly swerving
his paddle, shot the canoe into a narrow arm, and the garish
sunlight was suddenly lost in the densely intertwined branches
overhanging the little stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlet of <i>La Cienaga</i>, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo offered, laying
aside his paddle and taking his long boat pole. &ldquo;Lake Simit&iacute;
flows through this and into the Magdalena.&rdquo; For a few moments
he held the canoe steady, while from his wallet he drew a
few leaves of tobacco and deftly rolled a long, thick cigar.</p>
<p>The real work of the <i>boga</i> now began, and Rosendo with his
long punter settled down to the several hours&rsquo; strenuous grind
which was necessary to force the heavy canoe up the little outlet
and into the distant lake beyond. Back and forth he traveled
through the half-length of the boat, setting the pole well
forward in the soft bank, or out into the stream itself, and
then, with its end against his shoulder, urging and teasing the
craft a few feet at a time against the strong current. Jos&egrave;
imagined, as he dully watched him, that he could see death in
the pestiferous effluvia which emanated from the black, slimy
mud which every plunge of the long pole brought to the surface
of the narrow stream.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book1_page149' name='book1_page149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>The afternoon slowly waned, and the temperature lowered
a few degrees. A warm, animal-like breath drifted languidly
out from the moist jungle. The outlet, or <i>ca&ntilde;o</i>, was heavily
shaded throughout its length. Crocodiles lay along its muddy
banks, and slid into the water at the approach of the canoe.
Huge <i>iguanas</i>, the gorgeously colored lizards of tropical America,
scurried noisily through the overarching branches. Here and
there monkeys peeped curiously at the intruders and chattered
excitedly as they swung among the lofty treetops. But for his
exhaustion, Jos&egrave;, as he lay propped up against his trunk, gazing
vacantly upon the slowly unrolling panorama of marvelous
plant and animal life on either hand, might have imagined himself
in a realm of enchantment.</p>
<p>At length the vegetation abruptly ceased; the stream widened;
and the canoe entered a broad lake, at the far end of
which, three miles distant, its two whitewashed churches and
its plastered houses reflecting the red glow of the setting sun,
lay the ancient and decayed town of Simit&iacute;, the northern outlet
of Spain&rsquo;s mediaeval treasure house, at the edge of the forgotten
district of Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<p>Paddling gently across the unruffled surface of the tepid
waters, Rosendo and Juan silently urged the canoe through the
fast gathering dusk, and at length drew up on the shaly beach
of the old town. As they did so, a little girl, bare of feet and
with clustering brown curls, came running out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, padre Rosendo,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;what have you brought
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she saw Rosendo and Juan assisting the priest from
the boat, she drew back abashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Carmencita,&rdquo; whispered Juan to the little maid;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve brought you a <i>big</i> doll, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night fell as the priest stepped upon the shore of his new
home.</p>

</div>
<p>Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n opened his eyes and turned painfully on
his hard bed. The early sun streamed through the wooden
grating before the unglazed window. A slight, tepid breeze
stirred the mosquito netting over him. He was in the single
sleeping room of the house. It contained another bed like his
own, of rough <i>macana</i> palm strips, over which lay a straw mat
and a thin red blanket. Bed springs were unknown in Simit&iacute;.
On the rude door, cobwebbed and dusty, a scorpion clung torpidly.
From the room beyond he heard subdued voices. His
head and limbs ached dully; and frightful memories of the
river trip and the awful journey from Badillo sickened him.
With painful exertion he stood upon the moist dirt floor and
drew on his damp clothes. He had only a vague recollection of
the preceding night, but he knew that Rosendo had half led,
half dragged him past rows of dimly lighted, ghostly white
houses to his own abode, and there had put him to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy buenos dias, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; Rosendo greeted him, as
the priest dragged himself out into the living room. &ldquo;You have
slept long. But the se&ntilde;ora will soon have your breakfast. Sit
here&ndash;&ndash;not in the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo placed one of the rough wooden chairs, with
straight cowhide back and seat, near the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmencita has gone to the boat for fresh water. But&ndash;&ndash;here
she comes. Pour the <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i> a cup, <i>carita</i>,&rdquo; addressing
a little girl who at that moment entered the doorway, carrying
a large earthen bottle on her shoulder. It was the child
who had met the boat when the priest arrived the night, before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill the basin, too, <i>chiquita</i>, that the Padre may wash his
hands,&rdquo; added Rosendo.</p>
<p>The child approached Jos&egrave;, and with a dignified little courtesy
and a frank smile offered him a cup of the lukewarm
water. The priest accepted it languidly. But, glancing into
her face, his eyes suddenly widened, and the hand that was
carrying the tin cup to his lips stopped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page4' name='book2_page4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>The barefoot girl, clad only in a short, sleeveless calico
gown, stood before him like a portrait from an old master. Her
skin was almost white, with but a tinge of olive. Her dark
brown hair hung in curls to her shoulders and framed a face
of rarest beauty. Innocence, purity, and love radiated from her
fair features, from her beautifully rounded limbs, from her
soft, dark eyes that looked so fearlessly into his own.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; felt himself strangely moved. Somewhere deep within
his soul a chord had been suddenly struck by the little presence;
and the sound was unfamiliar to him. Yet it awakened
memories of distant scenes, of old dreams, and forgotten longings.
It seemed to echo from realms of his soul that had never
been penetrated. The tumult within died away. The raging
thought sank into calm. The man forgot himself, forgot that
he had come to Simit&iacute; to die. His sorrow vanished. His sufferings
faded. He remained conscious only of something that
he could not outline, something in the soul of the child, a thing
that perhaps he once possessed, and that he knew he yet prized
above all else on earth.</p>
<p>He heard Rosendo&rsquo;s voice through an immeasurable distance&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave us now, <i>chiquita</i>; the Padre wishes to have his
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child without speaking turned obediently; and the
priest&rsquo;s eyes followed her until she disappeared into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call her &lsquo;the smile of God,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Rosendo, noting the
priest&rsquo;s absorption, &ldquo;because she is always happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; remained sunk in thought. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful child!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;A wonderfully beautiful
child! I had no idea&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, she is heaven&rsquo;s gift to us poor folk. I sometimes
think the angels themselves left her on the river bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the river bank!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; was awake now. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;she
was not born here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Padre, but in Badillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you once lived in Badillo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, she is not my child&ndash;&ndash;except that the good
God has given her to me to protect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your child! Then whose is she?&rdquo; The priest&rsquo;s voice
was unwontedly eager and his manner animated.</p>
<p>But Rosendo fell suddenly quiet and embarrassed, as if he
realized that already he had said too much to a stranger. A
shade of suspicion seemed to cross his face, and he rose hurriedly
and went out into the kitchen. A moment later he returned
with the priest&rsquo;s breakfast&ndash;&ndash;two fried eggs, a hot corn
<i>arepa</i>, fried <i>platanos</i>, dried fish, and coffee sweetened with
<i>panela</i>.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page5' name='book2_page5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When you have finished, Padre, we will visit the Alcalde,&rdquo;
he said quietly. &ldquo;I must go down to the lake now to speak with
Juan before he goes out to fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; finished his meal alone. The interest which had been
aroused by the child continued to increase without reaction.
His torpid soul had been profoundly stirred. For the moment,
though he knew not why, life seemed to hold a vague, unshaped
interest for him. He began to notice his environment; he even
thought he relished the coarse food set before him.</p>
<p>The house he was in was a typical native three-room dwelling,
built of strips of <i>macana</i> palm, set upright and tied together
with pieces of slender, tough <i>bejuco</i> vine. The interstices
between the strips were filled with mud, and the whole
whitewashed. The floors were dirt, trodden hard; the steep-pitched
roof was thatched with palm. A few chairs like the
one he occupied, the rude, uncovered table, some cheap prints
and a battered crucifix on the wall, were the only furnishings of
the living room.</p>
<p>While he was eating, the people of the town congregated
quietly about the open door. Friendly curiosity to see the new
Padre, and sincere desire to welcome him animated their simple
minds. Naked babes crawled to the threshold and peeped
timidly in. Coarsely clad women and young girls, many of the
latter bedizened with bits of bright ribbon or cheap trinkets,
smiled their gentle greetings. Black, dignified men, bare of
feet, and wearing white cotton trousers and black <i>ruanas</i>&ndash;&ndash;the
cape affected by the poor males of the inlands&ndash;&ndash;respectfully
doffed their straw hats and bowed to him. Rosendo&rsquo;s wife appeared
from the kitchen and extended her hand to him in unfeigned
hospitality. Attired in a fresh calico gown, her black
hair plastered back over her head and tied with a clean black
ribbon, her bare feet encased in hemp sandals, she bore herself
with that grace and matronly dignity so indicative of her
Spanish forbears, and so particularly characteristic of the inhabitants
of this &ldquo;valley of the pleasant &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast finished, the priest stepped to the doorway and
raised his hand in the invocation that was evidently expected
from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dominus vobiscum</i>,&rdquo; he repeated, not mechanically, not insincerely,
but in a spirit of benevolence, of genuine well-wishing,
which his contact with the child a few minutes before
seemed to have aroused.</p>
<p>The people bent their heads piously and murmured, &ldquo;<i>Et
cum spiritu tuo.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The open door looked out upon the central <i>plaza</i>, where
stood a large church of typical colonial design and construction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page6' name='book2_page6'></a>6</span>
and with a single lateral bell tower. The building was
set well up on a platform of shale, with broad shale steps,
much broken and worn, leading up to it on all sides. Jos&egrave;
stepped out and mingled with the crowd, first regarding the old
church curiously, and then looking vainly for the little girl, and
sighing his disappointment when he did not see her.</p>
<p>In the <i>plaza</i> he was joined by Rosendo; and together they
went to the house of the Alcalde. On the way the priest gazed
about him with growing curiosity. To the north of the town
stretched the lake, known to the residents only by the name of
<i>La Cienaga</i>. It was a body of water of fair size, in a setting of
exquisite tropical beauty. In a temperate climate, and a region
more densely populated, this lake would have been priceless.
Here in forgotten Guamoc&oacute; it lay like an undiscovered gem,
known only to those few inert and passive folk, who enjoyed
it with an inadequate sense of its rare beauty and immeasurable
worth. Several small and densely wooded isles rose from
its unrippled bosom; and tropical birds of brilliant color hovered
over it in the morning sun. Near one of its margins Jos&egrave;
distinguished countless white <i>garzas</i>, the graceful herons whose
plumes yield the coveted aigrette of northern climes. They fed
undisturbed, for this region sleeps unmolested, far from the
beaten paths of tourist or vandal huntsman. To the west and
south lay the hills of Guamoc&oacute;, and the lofty <i>Cordilleras</i>, purpling
in the light mist. Over the entire scene spread a damp
warmth, like the atmosphere of a hot-house. By midday Jos&egrave;
knew that the heat would be insufferable.</p>
<p>The Alcalde, Don Mario Arvila, conducted his visitors
through his shabby little store and into the <i>patio</i> in the rear,
exclaiming repeatedly, &ldquo;Ah, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, we welcome you! All
Simit&iacute; welcomes you and kisses your hand!&rdquo; In the shade of
his arbor he sat down to examine Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s letters from Cartagena.</p>
<p>Don Mario was a large, florid man, huge of girth, with brown
skin, heavy jowls, puffed eyes, and bald head. As he read, his
eyes snapped, and at times he paused and looked up curiously
at the priest. Then, without comment, he folded the letters and
put them into a pocket of his crash coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said politely, &ldquo;we must have the Padre meet Don
Felipe Alcozer as soon as he returns. Some repairs are needed
on the church; a few of the roof tiles have slipped, and the rain
enters. Perhaps, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, you may say the Mass there next
Sunday. We will see. A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;you had illustrious ancestors,
Padre,&rdquo; he added with hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the letters mention my ancestry?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave; with
something of mingled surprise and pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They speak of your family, which was, as we all know,
quite renowned,&rdquo; replied the Alcalde courteously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page7' name='book2_page7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; agreed Jos&egrave;, wondering how much the Alcalde knew
of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ignacio was not unknown in this <i>pueblo</i>,&rdquo; affably continued
the Alcalde.</p>
<p>At these words Rosendo started visibly and looked fixedly at
the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family name of Rinc&oacute;n,&rdquo; the Alcalde went on, &ldquo;appears
on the old records of Simit&iacute; in many places, and it is said that
Don Ignacio himself came here more than once. Perhaps you
know, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, that the Rinc&oacute;n family erected the church
which stands in the <i>plaza</i>? And so it is quite appropriate that
their son should officiate in it after all these centuries, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Jos&egrave; had not known it. He could not have imagined
such a thing. He knew little of his family&rsquo;s history. Of their
former vast wealth he had a vague notion. But here in this
land of romance and tragedy he seemed to be running upon
their reliques everywhere.</p>
<p>The conversation drifted to parish matters; and soon Rosendo
urged their departure, as the sun was mounting high.</p>
<p>Seated at the table for the midday lunch, Jos&egrave; again became
lost in contemplation of the child before him. Her fair face
flushed under his searching gaze; but she returned a smile of
confidence and sweet innocence that held him spellbound. Her
great brown eyes were of infinite depth. They expressed a
something that he had never seen before in human eyes. What
manner of soul lay behind them? What was it that through
them looked out into this world of evil? Childish innocence
and purity, yes; but vastly more. Was it&ndash;&ndash;God Himself? Jos&egrave;
started at his own thought. Through his meditations he heard
Rosendo&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute; is very old, Padre. In the days of the Spaniards it
was a large town, with many rich people. The Indians were
all slaves then, and they worked in the mines up there,&rdquo; indicating
the distant mountains. &ldquo;Much gold was brought down
here and shipped down the Magdalena, for the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> was wider
in those days, and it was not so hard to reach the river. This
is the end of the Guamoc&oacute; trail, which was called in those days
the <i>Camino Real</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the mines were very rich?&rdquo; interrogated Jos&egrave;; not
that the question expressed a more than casual interest, but
rather to keep Rosendo talking while he studied the child.</p>
<p>But at this question Rosendo suddenly became less loquacious.
Jos&egrave; then felt that he was suspected of prying into matters
which Rosendo did not wish to discuss with him, and so
he pressed the topic no further.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page8' name='book2_page8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How many people did Don Mario say the parish contained?&rdquo;
he asked by way of diverting the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hundred, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it has been vacant long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years since Padre Diego was here,&rdquo; commented Jos&egrave;
casually.</p>
<p>It was an unfortunate remark. At the mention of the
former priest&rsquo;s name Do&ntilde;a Maria hurriedly left the table.
Rosendo&rsquo;s black face grew even darker, and took on a look of
ineffable contempt. He did not reply. And the meal ended in
silence.</p>
<p>It was now plain to Jos&egrave; that Rosendo distrusted him. But
it mattered little to the priest, beyond the fact that he had no
wish to offend any one. What interest had he in boorish Simit&iacute;,
or Guamoc&oacute;? The place was become his tomb&ndash;&ndash;he had entered
it to die. The child&ndash;&ndash;the girl! Ah, yes, she had touched a
strange chord within him; and for a time he had seemed to
live again. But as the day waned, and pitiless heat and deadly
silence brooded over the decayed town, his starving soul sank
again into its former depression, and revived hope and interest
died within him.</p>
<p>The implacable heat burned through the noon hour; the
dusty streets were like the floor of a stone oven; the shale beds
upon which the old town rested sent up fiery, quivering waves;
the houses seethed; earth and sky were ablaze. How long could
he endure it?</p>
<p>And the terrible <i>ennui</i>, the isolation, the utter lack of every
trace of culture, of the varied interests that feed the educated,
trained mind and minister to its comfort and growth&ndash;&ndash;could
he support it patiently while awaiting the end? Would he go
mad before the final release came? He did not fear death; but
he was horror-stricken at the thought of madness! Of losing
that rational sense of the Ego which constituted his normal
individuality!</p>
<p>Rosendo advised him to retire for the midday <i>siesta</i>.
Through the seemingly interminable afternoon he lay upon his
hard bed with his brain afire, while the events of his warped
life moved before him in spectral review. The week which had
passed since he left Cartagena seemed an age. When he might
hope to receive word from the outside world, he could not
imagine. His isolation was now complete. Even should letters
succeed in reaching Simit&iacute; for him, they must first pass
through the hands of the Alcalde.</p>
<p>And what did the Alcalde know of him? And then, again,
what did it matter? He must not lose sight of the fact that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page9' name='book2_page9'></a>9</span>
interest in the outside world&ndash;&ndash;nay, his interest in all things
had ceased. This was the end. He had yielded, after years of
struggle, to pride, fear, doubt. He had bowed before his morbid
sense of honor&ndash;&ndash;a perverted sense, he now admitted, but still
one which bound him in fetters of steel. His life had been one
of grossest inconsistency. He was utterly out of tune with the
universe. His incessant clash with the world of people and
events had sounded nothing but agonizing discord. And his
confusion of thought had become such that, were he asked why
he was in Simit&iacute;, he could scarcely have told. At length he
dropped into a feverish sleep.</p>
<p>The day drew to a close, and the flaming sun rested for a
brief moment on the lofty tip of Tolima. Jos&egrave; awoke, dripping
with perspiration, his steaming blood rushing wildly through
its throbbing channels. Blindly he rose from his rough bed
and stumbled out of the stifling chamber. The living room was
deserted. Who might be in the kitchen, he did not stop to see.
Dazed by the garish light and fierce heat, he rushed from the
house and over the burning shales toward the lake.</p>
<p>What he intended to do, he knew not. His weltering thought
held but a single concept&ndash;&ndash;water! The lake would cool his
burning skin&ndash;&ndash;he would wade out into it until it rose to his
cracking lips&ndash;&ndash;he would lie down in it, till it quenched the fire
in his head&ndash;&ndash;he would sleep in it&ndash;&ndash;he would never leave it&ndash;&ndash;it
was cool&ndash;&ndash;perhaps cold! What did the word mean? Was there
aught in the world but fire&ndash;&ndash;flames&ndash;&ndash;fierce, withering, smothering,
consuming heat? He thought the shales crackled as they
melted beneath him! He thought his feet sank to the ankles in
molten lava, and were so heavy he scarce could drag them! He
thought the blazing sun shot out great tongues of flame, like
the arms of a monster devilfish, which twined about him, transforming
his blood to vapor and sucking it out through his
gaping pores!</p>
<p>A blinding light flashed before him as he reached the margin
of the lake. The universe burst into a ball of fire. He clasped
his head in his hands&ndash;&ndash;stumbled&ndash;&ndash;and fell, face down, in the
tepid waters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was the little Carmen, Padre, who saw you run to the lake.
She was sitting at the kitchen door, studying her writing lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest essayed to rise from his bed. Night had fallen,
and the feeble light of the candle cast heavy shadows over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page10' name='book2_page10'></a>10</span>
room, and made grotesque pictures of the black, anxious faces
looking in at the grated window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo, it&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;a dream&ndash;&ndash;a terrible dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, it was true, for I myself took you from the lake,&rdquo;
replied Rosendo tenderly.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; struggled to a sitting posture, but would have fallen
back again had not Rosendo&rsquo;s strong arm supported him. He
passed his hand slowly across his forehead, as if to brush the
mental cobwebs from his awakening brain. Then he inquired
feebly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the doctor say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, there is no doctor in Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; Rosendo answered
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; kept silence for a few moments. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I do not need one. What time did it occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not happen to-day, Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo with pitying
compassion. &ldquo;It was nearly a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a week! And have I lain here so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest stared at him uncomprehendingly. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dreams were frightful! I must have talked&ndash;&ndash;raved!
Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;you heard me&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; His voice betrayed anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Padre, think no more about it. You were wild&ndash;&ndash;I
fought to keep you in bed&ndash;&ndash;we thought you must die&ndash;&ndash;all but
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;but you have your senses now&ndash;&ndash;and you must forget
the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forget the past! Then his wild delirium had laid bare his
soul! And the man who had so faithfully nursed him through
the crisis now possessed the sordid details of this wretched
life!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; struggled to orient his undirected mind. A hot wave
of anger swept over him at the thought that he was still living,
that his battered soul had not torn itself from earth during his
delirium and taken flight. Was he fated to live forever, to drag
out an endless existence, with his heart written upon his sleeve
for the world to read and turn to its own advantage? Rosendo
had stood between him and death&ndash;&ndash;but to what end? Had he
not yet paid the score in full&ndash;&ndash;good measure, pressed down and
running over? His thoughts ran rapidly from one topic to another.
Again they reverted to the little girl. He had dreamed
of her in that week of black night. He wondered if he had also
talked of her. He had lain at death&rsquo;s door&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo had said
so&ndash;&ndash;but he had had no physician. Perhaps these simple folk
brewed their own homely remedies&ndash;&ndash;he wondered what they
had employed in his case. Above the welter of his thoughts
this question pressed for answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page11' name='book2_page11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What medicine did you give me, Rosendo?&rdquo; he feebly
queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s voice rose querulously in a little excess of excitement.
&ldquo;What! You left me here without medical aid, to live or die,
as might be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentle Rosendo laid a soothing hand upon the priest&rsquo;s
feverish brow. &ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;there was a hurt tone in the soft
answer&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we did all we could for you. We have neither doctors
nor medicines. But we cared for you&ndash;&ndash;and we prayed daily for
your recovery. The little Carmen said our prayers would be
answered&ndash;&ndash;and, you see, they were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the child!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what had she to do with my recovery?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; demanded
fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> It is sometimes that way when the little Carmen
says people shall not die. And then,&rdquo; he added sadly,
&ldquo;sometimes they do die just the same. It is strange; we do not
understand it.&rdquo; The gentle soul sighed its perplexity.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked up at him keenly. &ldquo;Did the child say I should
not die?&rdquo; he asked softly, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre; she says God&rsquo;s children do not die,&rdquo; returned
Rosendo.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s blood stopped in its mad surge and slowly began
to chill. God&rsquo;s children do not die! What uncanny influence
had he met with here in this crumbling, forgotten town? He
sought the index of his memory for the sensations he had felt
when he looked into the girl&rsquo;s eyes on his first morning in
Simit&iacute;. But memory reported back only impressions of goodness&ndash;&ndash;beauty&ndash;&ndash;love.</p>
<p>Then a dim light&ndash;&ndash;only a feeble gleam&ndash;&ndash;seemed to flash before
him, but at a great distance. Something called him&ndash;&ndash;not
by name, but by again touching that unfamiliar chord which
had vibrated in his soul when the child had first stood before
him. He felt a strange psychic presentiment as of things soon
to be revealed. A sentiment akin to awe stole over him, as if
he were standing in the presence of a great mystery&ndash;&ndash;a mystery
so transcendental that the groveling minds of mortals have
never apprehended it. He turned again to the man sitting
beside his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep, Padre,&rdquo; pointing to the other bed. &ldquo;But we must
not wake her,&rdquo; he admonished quickly, as the priest again
sought to rise; &ldquo;we will talk of her to-morrow. I think&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo stopped abruptly and looked at the priest as if he
would fathom the inmost nature of the man. Then he continued
uncertainly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page12' name='book2_page12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I may have some things to say to you to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;if you
are well enough to hear them. But I will think about it to-night,
and&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>! I will think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo rose slowly, as if weighted with heavy thoughts,
and went out into the living room. Presently he returned with
a rude, homemade broom and began to sweep a space on the
dirt floor in the corner opposite Jos&egrave;. This done, he spread out
a light straw mat for his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;ora is preparing you a bowl of chicken broth and
rice, Padre,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The little Carmen saved a hen for you
when you should awake. She has fed it all the week on rice
and goat&rsquo;s milk. She said she knew you would wake up hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s eyes had closely followed Rosendo&rsquo;s movements, although
he seemed not to hear his words. Suddenly he broke
forth in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have I your bed? And do you sleep
there on the floor? I cannot permit this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, gently forcing Jos&egrave;
back again upon his bed. &ldquo;My house is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the se&ntilde;ora, your wife&ndash;&ndash;where does she sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has her <i>petate</i> in the kitchen,&rdquo; was the quiet answer.</p>
<p>Only the two poor beds, which were occupied by the priest
and the child! And Rosendo and his good wife had slept on
the hard dirt floor for a week! Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s eyes dimmed when he
realized the extent of their unselfish hospitality. And would
they continue to sleep thus on the ground, with nothing beneath
them but a thin straw mat, as long as he might choose to
remain with them? Aye, he knew that they would, uncomplainingly.
For these are the children of the &ldquo;valley of the
pleasant &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; awoke the next morning with a song echoing in his
ears. He had dreamed of singing; and as consciousness slowly
returned, the dream-song became real. It floated in from the
living room on a clear, sweet soprano. When a child he had
heard such voices in the choir loft of the great Seville cathedral,
and he had thought that angels were singing. As he lay now
listening to it, memories of his childish dreams swept over
him in great waves. The soft, sweet cadences rose and fell.
His own heart swelled and pulsated with them, and his barren
soul once more surged under the impulse of a deep, potential
desire to manifest itself, its true self, unhampered at last by
limitation and convention, unfettered by superstition, human
creeds and false ambition. Then the inevitable reaction set in;
a sickening sense of the futility of his longing settled over him,
and he turned his face to the wall, while hot tears streamed
over his sunken cheeks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page13' name='book2_page13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>Again through his wearied brain echoed the familiar admonition,
&ldquo;Occupy till I come.&rdquo; Always the same invariable
response to his strained yearnings. The sweet voice in the
adjoining room floated in through the dusty palm door. It
spread over his perturbed thought like oil on troubled waters.
Perhaps it was the child singing. At this thought the sense of
awe seemed to settle upon him again. A child&ndash;&ndash;a babe&ndash;&ndash;had
said that he should live! If a doctor had said it he would have
believed. But a child&ndash;&ndash;absurd! It was a dream! But no;
Rosendo had said it; and there was no reason to doubt him.
But what had this child to do with it? Nothing! And yet&ndash;&ndash;was
that wholly true? Then whence his sensations when first
he saw her? Whence that feeling of standing in the presence
of a great mystery? &ldquo;Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
Foolishness! To be sure, the child may have said
he should not die; but if he were to live&ndash;&ndash;which God forbid!&ndash;&ndash;his
own recuperative powers would restore him. Rosendo&rsquo;s
lively imagination certainly had exaggerated the incident.</p>
<p>Exhausted by his mental efforts, and lulled by the low
singing, the priest sank into fitful slumber. As he slept he
dreamed. He was standing alone in a great desert. Darkness
encompassed him, and a fearful loneliness froze his soul. About
him lay bleaching bones. Neither trees nor vegetation broke
the dull monotony of the cheerless scene. Nothing but waste,
unutterably dreary waste, over which a chill wind tossed the
tinkling sand in fitful gusts. In terror he cried aloud. The
desert mocked his hollow cry. The darkness thickened. Again
he called, his heart sinking with despair.</p>
<p>Then, over the desolate waste, through the heavy gloom, a
voice seemed borne faint on the cold air, &ldquo;Occupy till I come!&rdquo;
He sank to his knees. His straining eyes caught the feeble
glint of a light, but at an immeasurable distance. Again he
called; and again the same response, but nearer. A glow began
to suffuse the blackness about him. Nearer, ever nearer drew
the gleam. The darkness lifted. The rocks began to bud.
Trees and vines sprang from the waste sand. As if in a tremendous
explosion, a dazzling light burst full upon him, shattering
the darkness, fusing the stones about him, and blinding
his sight. A great presence stood before him. He struggled to
his feet; and as he did so a loud voice cried, &ldquo;Behold, I come
<i>quickly</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, you have been dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest, sitting upright and clutching at the rough sides
of his bed, stared with wooden obliviousness into the face of
the little Carmen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are well now, aren&rsquo;t you, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not so much an interrogation as an affirmation,
an assumption of fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you must come and see my garden&ndash;&ndash;and Cucumbra,
too. And Cantar-las-horas; have you heard him? I scolded
him lots; and I know he wants to mind; but he just thinks he
can&rsquo;t stop singing the Vespers&ndash;&ndash;the old stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the child prattled she drew a chair to the bedside
and arranged the bowl of broth and the two wheat rolls she
had brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are real hungry, and you are going to eat all of this
and get strong again. Right away!&rdquo; she added, emphatically
expressing her confidence in the assumption.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; made no reply. He seemed again to be trying to sound
the unfathomable depths of the child&rsquo;s brown eyes. Mechanically
he took the spoon she handed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she exclaimed, while her eyes danced. &ldquo;A silver
spoon! Madre Ariza borrowed it from Do&ntilde;a Maria Alcozer.
They have lots of silver. Now eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his own great egoism, his years of heart-ache, sorrows,
and shames, the priest&rsquo;s heavy thought slowly lifted and centered
upon the child&rsquo;s beautiful face. The animated little
figure before him radiated such abundant life that he himself
caught the infection; and with it his sense of weakness passed
like an illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look, Padre! The broth&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t it good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; tasted, and declared it delicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the enthusiastic little maid clambered
up on the bed&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;yesterday it was Ma&ntilde;uela&ndash;&ndash;she was my hen.
I told her a week ago that you would need her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you gave up your hen for me, little one?&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;yes, Padre. It was all right. I told her how it was.
And she clucked so hard, I knew she was glad to help the
good <i>Cura</i>. And she was so happy about it! I told her she
really wouldn&rsquo;t die. You know, things never do&ndash;&ndash;do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest hesitated. To hide his confusion and gain time
he began to eat rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl confidently, answering her
own question. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;God is <i>everywhere</i>&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t
He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What manner of answer could he, of all men, make to such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page15' name='book2_page15'></a>15</span>
terribly direct questions as these! And it was well that Carmen
evidently expected none&ndash;&ndash;that in her great innocence she
assumed for him the same beautiful faith which she herself
held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Jacinta didn&rsquo;t die last week. But they said she did;
and so they took her to the cemetery and put her in a dark
<i>b&oacute;veda</i>. And the black buzzards sat on the wall and watched
them. Padre Rosendo said she had gone to the angels&ndash;&ndash;that
God took her. But, Padre, God doesn&rsquo;t make people sick, does
He? They get sick because they don&rsquo;t know who He is. Every
day I told God I knew He would cure you. And He did, didn&rsquo;t
He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the girl paused for breath, her eyes sparkled, and
her face glowed with exaltation. Child-like, her active mind
flew from one topic to another, with no thought of connecting
links.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, Padre, two little green parrots flew across
the lake and perched on our roof. And they sat there and
watched Cucumbra eat his breakfast; and they tried to steal
his fish; and they scolded so loud! Why did they want to
steal from him, when there is so much to eat everywhere?
But they didn&rsquo;t know any better, did they? I don&rsquo;t think
parrots love each other very much, for they scold so hard.
Padre, it is so dark in here; come out and see the sun and the
lake and the mountains. And my garden&ndash;&ndash;Padre, it is beautiful!
Esteban said next time he went up the trail he would
bring me a monkey for a pet; and I am going to name it Hombrecito.
And Captain Julio is going to bring me a doll from
down the river. But,&rdquo; with a merry, musical trill, &ldquo;Juan said
the night you came that <i>you</i> were my doll! Isn&rsquo;t he funny!&rdquo;
And throwing back her little head, the child laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you must help padre Rosendo with his arithmetic.
Every night he puts on his big spectacles and works so hard
to understand it. He says he knows Satan made fractions.
But, Padre, that isn&rsquo;t so, is it? Not if God made everything.
Padre, you know <i>everything</i>, don&rsquo;t you? Padre Rosendo said
you did. There are lots of things I want you to tell me&ndash;&ndash;such
lots of things that nobody here knows anything about. Padre,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
child leaned toward the priest and whispered low&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
people here don&rsquo;t know who God is; and you are going to teach
them! There was a <i>Cura</i> here once, when I was a baby; but
I guess he didn&rsquo;t know God, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lapsed into silence, as if pondering this thought. Then,
clapping her hands with unfeigned joy, she cried in a shrill
little voice, &ldquo;Oh, Padre, I am <i>so</i> glad you have come to Simit&iacute;!
I just <i>knew</i> God would not forget us!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page16' name='book2_page16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; had no reply to make. His thought was busy with
the phenomenon before him: a child of man, but one who, like
Israel of old, saw God and heard His voice at every turn of
her daily walk. Untutored in the ways of men, without trace
of sophistication or cant, unblemished as she moved among
the soiled vessels about her, shining with celestial radiance in
this unknown, moldering town so far from the world&rsquo;s beaten
paths.</p>
<p>The door opened softly and Rosendo entered, preceded by
a cheery greeting.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, surveying the priest, &ldquo;but you
mend fast! You have eaten all the broth! But I told the good
wife that the little Carmen would be better than medicine for
you, and that you must have her just as soon as you should
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s eyes dilated with astonishment. Absorbed in the
child, he had consumed almost his entire breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is well, padre Rosendo, he is well!&rdquo; cried the girl,
bounding up and down and dancing about the tall form of her
foster-father. Then, darting to Jos&egrave;, she seized his hand and
cried, &ldquo;Now to see my garden! And Cucumbra! And&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, child!&rdquo; commanded Rosendo, taking her by the
arm. &ldquo;The good <i>Cura</i> is ill, and must rest for several days
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, padre Rosendo, he is well&ndash;&ndash;all well! Aren&rsquo;t you,
Padre?&rdquo; appealing to Jos&egrave;, and again urging him forth.</p>
<p>The rapidity of the conversation and the animation of the
beautiful child caused complete forgetfulness of self, and, together
with the restorative effect of the wholesome food, acted
upon the priest like a magical tonic. Weak though he was, he
clung to her hand and, struggling out of the bed, stood uncertainly
upon the floor. Instantly Rosendo&rsquo;s arm was about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try it, Padre,&rdquo; the latter urged anxiously. &ldquo;The
heat will be too much for you. Another day or two of rest will
make you right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the priest, heedless of the admonition, suffered himself
to be led by the child; and together they passed slowly out into
the living room, through the kitchen, and thence into the
diminutive rose garden, the pride of the little Carmen.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria, wife of Rosendo, was bending over the primitive
fireplace, busy with her matutinal duties, having just
dusted the ashes from a corn <i>arepa</i> which she had prepared
for her consort&rsquo;s simple luncheon. She was a woman well
into the autumn of life; but her form possessed something of
the elegance of the Spanish dames of the colonial period; her
countenance bore an expression of benevolence, which emanated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page17' name='book2_page17'></a>17</span>
from a gentle and affectionate heart; and her manner
combined both dignity and suavity. She greeted the priest
tenderly, and expressed mingled surprise and joy that he felt
able to leave his bed so soon. But as her eyes caught Rosendo&rsquo;s
meaning glance, and then turned to the child, they seemed to
indicate a full comprehension of the situation.</p>
<p>The rose garden consisted of a few square feet of black
earth, bordered by bits of shale, and seemingly scarce able to
furnish nourishment for the three or four little bushes. But,
though small, these were blooming in profusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo did this!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted girl.
&ldquo;Every night he brings water from <i>La Cienaga</i> for them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo smiled patronizingly upon the child; but Jos&egrave; saw
in the glance of his argus eyes a tenderness and depth of affection
for her which bespoke nothing short of adoration.</p>
<p>Carmen bent over the roses, fondling and kissing them, and
addressing them endearing names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She calls them God&rsquo;s kisses,&rdquo; whispered Rosendo to the
priest.</p>
<p>At that moment a low growl was heard. Jos&egrave; turned quickly
and confronted a gaunt dog, a wild breed, with eyes fixed
upon the priest and white fangs showing menacingly beneath
a curling lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cucumbra!&rdquo; cried the child, rushing to the beast and
throwing her arms about its shaggy neck. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you
to love everybody? And is that the way to show it? Now
kiss the <i>Cura&rsquo;s</i> hand, for he loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brute sank at her feet. Then as she took the priest&rsquo;s
hand and held it to the dog&rsquo;s mouth, he licked it with his
rough tongue.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s brain was now awhirl. He stood gazing at the
child as if fascinated. Through his jumbled thought there ran
an insistent strain, &ldquo;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.
The Father dwelleth in me and I in Him.&rdquo; He did not associate
these words with the Nazarene now, but with the barefoot girl
before him. Again within the farthest depths of his soul he
heard the soft note of a vibrating chord&ndash;&ndash;that chord which all
the years of his unhappy life had hung mute, until here, in this
moldering town, in the wilderness of forgotten Guamoc&oacute;, the
hand of Love had swept it.</p>
<p>The sun stood at the zenith. The day was white-hot. Do&ntilde;a
Maria summoned her little family to the midday repast. Rosendo
brought a chair for Jos&egrave; and placed it near the rose
garden in the shade of the house, for, despite all protest, the
priest had stubbornly refused to return to his bed. Left now to
himself, his thought hovered about the child, and then drifted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page18' name='book2_page18'></a>18</span>
out across the incandescent shales to the beautiful lake beyond.
The water lay like shimmering glass. In the distance the
wooded slopes of the San Lucas mountains rose like green billows.
Brooding silence spread over the scene. It was Nature&rsquo;s
hour of <i>siesta</i>. In his own heart there was a great peace&ndash;&ndash;and
a strange expectancy. He seemed to be awaiting a revelation
of things close at hand. In a way he felt that he had accomplished
his purpose of coming to Simit&iacute; to die, and that he was
now awaiting the resurrection.</p>
<p>The peaceful revery was interrupted by Rosendo. &ldquo;Padre,
if you will not return to your bed&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He regarded the priest
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rosendo. I grow stronger every minute. But&ndash;&ndash;where
is Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must help her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long pause ensued, while Jos&egrave; impatiently waited for
Rosendo to continue. The child was becoming his obsession.
He was eager to talk of her, to learn her history, to see her,
for her presence meant complete obliteration of self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo at length emerged from his meditation.
&ldquo;I would like to speak of the little Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded Jos&egrave; with animation. Life and strength
seemed to return to him with a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;what say you? Shall we visit the church, which is
only across the road? There we can talk without interruption.
No one will be in the streets during the heat. And I will
carry you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to the church, yes; but I can walk. It is only a
step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; leaned upon Rosendo, the latter supporting him with
his great arm, and together they crossed the road and mounted
the shale platform on which stood the ancient edifice. Rosendo
produced a huge key of antique pattern; and the rusty lock,
after much resistance, yielded with a groan, and the heavy
door creaked open, emitting an odor of dampness and must.
Doffing their hats, the men entered the long, barn-like room.
Rosendo carefully closed and locked the door behind them, a
precaution necessary in a drowsing town of this nature, where
the simple folk who see day after day pass without concern or
event to break the deadening monotony, assemble in eager,
buzzing multitudes at the slightest prospect of extraordinary
interest.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lighted, and was open to the peak of
the roof. From the rough-hewn rafters above hung hundreds
of hideous bats. At the far end stood the altar. It was
adorned with decrepit images, and held a large wooden statue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page19' name='book2_page19'></a>19</span>
of the Virgin. This latter object was veiled with two flimsy
curtains, which were designed to be raised and lowered with
great pomp and the ringing of a little bell during service. The
image was attired in real clothes, covered with tawdry finery,
gilt paper, and faded ribbons. The head bore a wig of hair;
and the face was painted, although great sections of the paint
had fallen, away, leaving the suggestion of pockmarks. Beneath
this image was located the <i>sagrario</i>, the little cupboard in which
the <i>hostia</i>, the sacred wafer, was wont to be kept exposed in
the <i>custodia</i>, a cheap receptacle composed of two watch crystals.
At either side of this stood half consumed wax tapers. A
few rough benches were strewn about the floor; and dust and
green mold lay thick over all.</p>
<p>At the far right-hand corner of the building a lean-to had
been erected to serve as the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i>, or vestry. In the worm-eaten
wardrobe within hung a few vestments, adorned with
cheap finery, and heavily laden with dust, over which scampered
vermin of many varieties. An air of desolation and
abandon hung over the whole church, and to Jos&egrave; seemed to
symbolize the decay of a sterile faith.</p>
<p>Rosendo carefully dusted off a bench near one of the windows
and bade Jos&egrave; be seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Padre</i>,&rdquo; he began, after some moments of deep reflection,
&ldquo;the little Carmen is not an ordinary child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen that, Rosendo,&rdquo; interposed Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&ndash;&ndash;we do not understand her,&rdquo; Rosendo went on, carefully
weighing his words; &ldquo;and we sometimes think she is not&ndash;&ndash;not
altogether like us&ndash;&ndash;that her coming was a miracle. But
you do not believe in miracles,&rdquo; he added quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Rosendo?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; returned in surprise.</p>
<p>Rosendo paused before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very sick, Padre; and in the fever you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the
impeccably honest fellow hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought so,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; with an air of weary resignation.
&ldquo;And what else did I say, Rosendo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faultless courtesy of the artless Rosendo, a courtesy
so genuine that Jos&egrave; knew it came right from the heart, made
conversation on this topic a matter of extreme difficulty to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be uneasy, Padre,&rdquo; he said reassuringly. &ldquo;I alone
heard you. Whenever you began to talk I would not let others
listen; and I stayed with you every day and night. But&ndash;&ndash;it is
just because of what you said in the <i>calentura</i> that I am speaking
to you now of the little Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of what he had said in his delirium! Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s astonishment
grew apace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page20' name='book2_page20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, many bad priests have been sent to Simit&iacute;. It has
been our curse. Priests who stirred up revolution elsewhere,
who committed murder, and ruined the lives of fair women,
have been put upon us. And when in Badillo I learned that
you had been sent to our parish, I was filled with fear. I&ndash;&ndash;I
lost a daughter, Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man hesitated again. Then, as a look of stern
resolution spread over his strong, dark face, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Padre Diego! We drove him out of Simit&iacute; four
years ago. But my daughter, my only child, went with him.&rdquo;
The great frame shook with emotion, while he hurried on
disconnectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, the priest Diego said that the little Carmen should
become a Sister&ndash;&ndash;a nun&ndash;&ndash;that she must be sent to the convent
in Mompox&ndash;&ndash;that she belonged to the Church, and the Church
would some day have her. But, by the Holy Virgin, the Church
shall <i>not</i> have her! And I myself will slay her before this
altar rather than let such as Padre Diego lay their slimy paws
upon the angel child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo leaped to his feet and began to pace the floor with
great strides. The marvelous frame of the man, in which beat
a heart too big for the sordid passions of the flesh, trembled as
he walked. Jos&egrave; watched him in mute admiration, mingled
with astonishment and a heightened sense of expectancy. Presently
Rosendo returned and seated himself again beside the
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, I have lived in terror ever since Diego left Simit&iacute;.
For myself I do not fear, for if ever I meet with the wretch I
shall wring his neck with my naked hands! But&ndash;&ndash;for the little
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios!</i> they might steal her at any time! There are
men here who would do it for a few <i>pesos</i>! And how could
I prevent it? I pray daily to the Virgin to protect her. She&ndash;&ndash;she
is the light of my life. I watch over her hourly. I neglect
my <i>hacienda</i>, that I may guard her&ndash;&ndash;and I am a poor man,
and cannot afford not to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man buried his face in his huge hands and groaned
aloud. Jos&egrave; remained pityingly silent, knowing that Rosendo&rsquo;s
heaving heart must empty itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo at length raised his head. His features
were drawn, but his eyes glowed fiercely. &ldquo;Priests have committed
dark deeds here, and this altar has dripped with blood.
When a child, with my own eyes I saw a priest elevate the Host
before this altar, as the people knelt in adoration. While their
heads were bowed I saw him drive a knife into the neck of a
man who was his enemy; and the blood spurted over the image
of the Virgin and fell upon the Sacred Host itself! And what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page21' name='book2_page21'></a>21</span>
did the wicked priest say in defense? Simply that he took this
time to assassinate his man because then the victim could die
adoring the Host and under the most favorable circumstances
for salvation! <i>Hombre!</i> And did the priest pay the penalty
for his crime? No! The Bishop of Cartagena transferred him
to another parish, and told him to do better in future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; started in horror. But Rosendo did not stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I remember the story my father used to tell of the
priest who poisoned a whole family in Simit&iacute; with the communion
wafer. Their estates had been willed to the Church,
and he was impatient to have the management of them. Again
nothing was done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo, if Simit&iacute; has been so afflicted by bad priests,
why are you confiding in me?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; asked in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo replied, &ldquo;in the fever you said
many things that made me think you were not a bad man. I
did suspect you at first&ndash;&ndash;but not after I heard you talk in your
sleep. You, too, have suffered. And the Church has caused
it. No, not God; but the men who say they know what He
thinks and says. They make us all suffer. And after I heard
you tell those things in your fever-sleep, I said to Maria that
if you lived I knew you would help me protect the little Carmen.
Then, too, you are a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He lapsed abruptly into silence.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; pressed Rosendo&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Tell me about her. You
have said she is not your daughter. I ask only because of
sincere affection for you all, and because the child has aroused
in me an unwonted interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo looked steadily into the eyes of the priest for some
moments. Jos&egrave; as steadily returned the glance. From the
eyes of the one there emanated a soul-searching scrutiny; from
those of the other an answering bid for confidence. The bid
was accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; began Rosendo, &ldquo;I place trust in you. Something
makes me believe that you are not like other priests I have
known. And I have seen that you already love the little Carmen.
No, she is not my child. One day, about eight years ago,
a steamer on its way down the river touched at Badillo to put
off a young woman, who was so sick that the captain feared
she would die on board. He knew nothing of her, except that
she had embarked at Honda and was bound for Barranquilla.
He hoped that by leaving her in the care of the good people of
Badillo something might be done. The boat went its way; and
the next morning the woman died, shortly after her babe was
born. They buried her back of the village, and Escolastico&rsquo;s
woman took the child. They tried to learn the history of the
mother; but, though the captain of the boat made many inquiries,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page22' name='book2_page22'></a>22</span>
he could only find that she had come from Bogot&aacute; the
day before the boat left Honda, and that she was then very sick.
Some weeks afterward Escolastico happened to come to Simit&iacute;,
and told me the story. He complained that his family was
already large, and that his woman found the care of the babe
a burden. I love children, Padre, and it seemed to me that I
could find a place for the little one, and I told him I would
fetch her. And so a few days later I brought her to Simit&iacute;. But
before leaving Badillo I fixed a wooden cross over the mother&rsquo;s
grave and wrote on it in pencil the name &lsquo;<i>Dolores</i>,&rsquo; for that
was the name in the little gold locket which we found in her
valise. There were some clothes, better than the average, and
the locket. In the locket were two small pictures, one of a
young man, with the name &lsquo;<i>Guillermo</i>&rsquo; written beneath it, and
one of the woman, with &lsquo;<i>Dolores</i>&rsquo; under it. That was all.
Captain Julio took the locket to Honda when he made inquiries
there; but brought it back again, saying that nobody recognized
the faces. I named the babe Carmen, and have brought
her up as my own child. She&ndash;&ndash;Padre, I adore her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; listened in breathless silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we sometimes think,&rdquo; said Rosendo, resuming his
dramatic narrative, &ldquo;that it was all a miracle, perhaps a dream;
that it was the angels who left the babe on the river bank, for
she herself is not of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Rosendo, just what you mean,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; reverently,
laying his hand gently upon the older man&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Rosendo shook his head slowly. &ldquo;Talk with her, Padre, and
you will see. I cannot explain. Only, she is not like us. She
is like&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice dropped to a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;she is like&ndash;&ndash;God. And she knows Him better than she
knows me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s head slowly sank upon his breast. The gloom within
the musty church was thick; and the bats stirred restlessly
among the dusty rafters overhead. Outside, the relentless heat
poured down upon the deserted streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo resumed. &ldquo;In the <i>calentura</i> you talked
of wonderful things. You spoke of kings and popes and foreign
lands, of beautiful cities and great marvels of which we
know nothing. It was wonderful! And you recited beautiful
poems&ndash;&ndash;but often in other tongues than ours. Padre, you must
be very learned. I listened, and was astonished, for we are
so ignorant here in Simit&iacute;, oh, so ignorant! We have no
schools, and our poor little children grow up to be only <i>peones</i>
and fishermen. But&ndash;&ndash;the little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;ah, she has a mind!
Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page23' name='book2_page23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>Again he lapsed into silence, as if fearful to ask the boon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosendo, yes,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; eagerly reassured him. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo turned full upon the priest and spoke rapidly.
&ldquo;Padre, will you teach the little Carmen what you know? Will
you make her a strong, learned woman, and fit her to do big
things in the world&ndash;&ndash;and then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosendo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;then get her away from Simit&iacute;? She does not belong
here, Padre. And&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; his voice sank to a hoarse whisper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;will
you help me keep her from the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sat staring at the man with dilating eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, she has her own Church. It is her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned over and laid a hand upon the priest&rsquo;s knee. His
dark eyes seemed to burn like glowing coals. His whispered
words were fraught with a meaning which Jos&egrave; would some
day learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, <i>that</i> must be left alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence fell upon the two men, the one massive of
frame and black of face, but with a mind as simple as a child&rsquo;s
and a heart as white as the snow that sprinkled his raven
locks&ndash;&ndash;the other a youth in years, but bowed with disappointment
and suffering; yet now listening with hushed breath to
the words that rolled with a mighty reverberation through the
chambers of his soul:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am God, and there is none else! Behold, I come quickly!
Arise, shine, for thy light is come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sweet face of the child rose out of the gloom before
the priest. The years rolled back like a curtain, and he saw
himself at her tender age, a white, unformed soul, awaiting
the sculptor&rsquo;s hand. God forbid that the hand which shaped
his career should form the plastic mind of this girl!</p>
<p>Of a sudden a great thought flashed out of the depths of
eternity and into his brain, a thought which seemed to illumine
his whole past life. In the clear light thereof he seemed instantly
to read meanings in numberless events which to that
hour had remained hidden. His complex, misshapen career&ndash;&ndash;could
it have been a preparation?&ndash;&ndash;and for this? He had
yearned to serve his fellow-men, but had miserably failed.
For, while to will was always present with him, even as with
Paul, yet how to perform that which was good he found not.
But now&ndash;&ndash;what an opportunity opened before him! What a
beautiful offering of self was here made possible? God, what
a privilege!</p>
<p>Rosendo sat stolid, buried in thought. Jos&egrave; reached out
through the dim light and grasped his black hand. His eyes
were lucent, his heart burned with the fire of an unknown
enthusiasm, and speech stumbled across his lips.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page24' name='book2_page24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, I came to Simit&iacute; to die. And now I know that I
<i>shall</i> die&ndash;&ndash;to myself. But thereby shall I live. Yes, I shall
live! And here before this altar, in the sight of that God whom
she knows so well, I pledge my new-found life to Carmen. My
mind, my thought, my strength, are henceforth hers. May
her God direct me in their right use for His beautiful child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; and Rosendo rose from the bench with hands still
clasped. In that hour the priest was born again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporters of the unique Man of Galilee, upon
whose straining ears these words fell, noted them for
future generations of footsore pilgrims on life&rsquo;s wandering
highway&ndash;&ndash;for the rich, satiated with their gorgeous gluttonies;
for the proud Levite, with his feet enmeshed in the lifeless
letter of the Law; for the loathsome and outcast beggar at the
gates of Dives. And for Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, priest of the Holy
Catholic Church and vicar of Christ, scion of aristocracy and
worldly learning, now humbled and blinded, like Paul on the
road to Damascus, begging that his spiritual sight might be
opened to the glory of the One with whom he had not known
how to walk.</p>
<p>Returning in silence from the church to Rosendo&rsquo;s humble
cottage, Jos&egrave; had asked leave to retire. He would be alone with
the great Presence which had come to him across the desert
of his life, and now stood before him in the brightness of the
undimmed sun. He no longer felt ill nor exhausted. Indeed,
quite the contrary; a quickened sense of life, an eagerness to
embrace the opportunity opening before him, caused his chest
to heave and his shrunken veins to throb.</p>
<p>On his bed in the darkened room he lay in a deep silence,
broken only at intervals by the hurried scampering of lizards
darting through the interstices of the dry walls. His uncomprehending
eyes were fixed upon the dust-laden thatch of the
roof overhead, where droning wasps toiled upon their frail
abodes. He lay with the portals of his mind opened wide.
Through them, in ceaseless flow, passed two streams which
did not mingle. The one, outward bound, turbid with its
burden of egoism, fear, perplexity, and hopelessness, which,
like barnacles, had fastened to his soul on its chartless voyage;
the other, a stream of hope and confidence and definite purpose,
a stream which leaped and sang in the warm sunlight of
Love as it poured into his receptive brain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page25' name='book2_page25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>The fresh thought which flowed into his mental chambers
rapidly formed into orderly plans, all centering upon the child,
Carmen. What could he teach her? The relative truths and
worldly knowledge&ndash;&ndash;purified, as far as in him lay, from the
dross of speculation and human opinion&ndash;&ndash;which lay stored in
the archives of his mind? Yes; but that was all. History, and
its interpretation of human progress; the languages; mathematics,
and the elements of the physical sciences; literature;
and a knowledge of people and places. With these his retentive
mind was replete. But beyond this he must learn of her. And
her tutor, he now knew, was the Master Mind, omniscient God.
And he knew, more, that she possessed secrets whose potency
he might as yet scarcely imagine. For, in an environment which
for dearth of mental stimulus and incentive could scarcely be
matched; amid poverty but slightly raised above actual want;
untouched by the temperamental hopelessness which lies just
beneath the surface of these dull, simple folk, this child lived
a life of such ecstasy as might well excite the envy of the
world&rsquo;s potentates.</p>
<p>But meantime, what should be his attitude toward the
parish? He fully realized that he and the Church were now
as far apart as the poles. Yet this was become his parish, the
first he had ever held; and these were his people. And he
must face them and preach&ndash;&ndash;what? If not the Catholic faith,
then would he be speedily removed. And that meant complete
disruption of his rapidly formulating plans. But might he not
in that event flee with Carmen, renounce the Church, and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Impossible! Excommunication alone could sever the oath
by which the Church held him. And for that he could not say
that he was ready. For excommunication meant disgrace to
his mother&ndash;&ndash;perhaps the snapping of a heart already sorely
strained. To renounce his oath was dishonor. To preach the
Catholic faith without sincerity was scarcely less. Yet amid
present circumstances this seemed the only course open to
him.</p>
<p>But what must he teach Carmen in regard to the Church?
Could he maintain his position in it, yet not of it; and at the
same time rear her without its pale, yet so as not to conflict
with the people of Simit&iacute;, nor cause such comment as might
reach the ears of the Bishop of Cartagena? God alone knew.
It must be attempted, at any rate. There was no other way.
And if it was God&rsquo;s plan, he might safely trust Him for the
requisite strength and wisdom. For this course the isolation
of Simit&iacute; and the childish simplicity of its people afforded a
tremendous advantage. On the other hand, he knew that both
he and Carmen had powerful enemies. Yet, one with God
might rout a host. And Carmen walked with God.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page26' name='book2_page26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>Thus throughout the afternoon the priest weighed and pondered
the thoughts that sought admission to his reawakened
mind. He was not interrupted until sundown; and then Carmen
entered the room with a bowl of chocolate and some small
wheaten loaves. Behind her, with an amusing show of dignity,
stalked a large heron, an elegant bird, with long, scarlet legs,
gray plumage, and a gracefully curved neck. When the bird
reached the threshold it stopped, and without warning gave
vent to a prolonged series of shrill, unmusical sounds. The
startled priest sat up in his bed and exclaimed in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only Cantar-las-horas, Padre,&rdquo; laughed the little maid.
&ldquo;He follows me wherever I go, unless he is off fishing. Sometimes
when I go out in the boat with padre Rosendo he flies
clear across the lake to meet us. He is lots older than I, and
years ago, when there were <i>Curas</i> here, he learned his song.
Whenever the <i>Angelas</i> rang he would try to sing just like it;
and now he has the habit and can&rsquo;t help it. But he is such
a dear, wise old fellow,&rdquo; twining a chubby arm lovingly about
the bird&rsquo;s slender neck; &ldquo;and he always sings just at six o&rsquo;clock,
the time the <i>Angelas</i> used to ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heron manifested the deepest affection for the child as
she gently stroked its plumage and caressed its long, pointed
bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you suppose he knows when it is just six
o&rsquo;clock, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;, deeply interested in the strange
phenomenon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God tells him, Padre,&rdquo; was the direct and simple reply.</p>
<p>Assuredly, he should have known that! But he was fast
learning of this unusual child, whose every movement was a
demonstration of Immanuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does God tell you what to do, Carmen?&rdquo; he asked, seeking
to draw out the girl&rsquo;s strange thought, that he might probe
deeper into her religious convictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Padre.&rdquo; Her tone expressed surprise. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
He tell you, too?&rdquo; Her great eyes searched him. He was a
<i>Cura</i>; he should be very close to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;that is, He has told me to-day what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a shade of disappointment in her voice when
she replied: &ldquo;I guess you mean you listened to Him to-day,
don&rsquo;t you, Padre? I think sometimes you don&rsquo;t want to hear
Him. But,&rdquo; she finished with a little sigh, &ldquo;there are lots of
people here who don&rsquo;t; and that is why they are sick and unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was learning another lesson, that of guarding his
speech to this ingenuous girl. He discreetly changed the subject.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page27' name='book2_page27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing this afternoon, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes instantly brightened, and the dark shade that had
crossed her face disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after the <i>siesta</i> I helped madre Maria clean the
yuccas for supper; and then I did my writing lesson. Padre
Rosendo told me to-day that I could write better than he. But,
Padre, will you teach madre Maria to read and write? And
there are just lots of poor people here who can&rsquo;t, too. There
is a school teacher in Simit&iacute;, but he charges a whole <i>peso oro</i>
a month for teaching; and the people haven&rsquo;t the money, and
so they can&rsquo;t learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always the child shifted his thought from herself to others.
Again she showed him that the road to happiness wound among
the needs of his fellow-men. The priest mentally recorded the
instruction; and the girl continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo told madre Maria that you said you had
come to Simit&iacute; to die. You were not thinking of us then, were
you, Padre? People who think only of themselves always want
to die. That was why Don Luis died last year. He had lots
of gold, and he always wanted more, and he was cruel and selfish,
and he couldn&rsquo;t talk about anything but himself and how
rich he was&ndash;&ndash;and so he died. He didn&rsquo;t really die; but he
thought about himself until he thought he died. And so they
buried him. That&rsquo;s what always happens to people who think
about themselves all the time&ndash;&ndash;they get buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was glad of the silence that fell upon them. Wrapped
so long in his own egoism, he had now no worldly wisdom with
which to match this girl&rsquo;s sapient words. He waited. He felt
that Carmen was but the channel through which a great Voice
was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; the tones were tender and soft, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t always
think of good things, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Why, no, little girl. I guess I haven&rsquo;t done so. That
is, not always. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because if you had you wouldn&rsquo;t have been driven into
the lake that day. And you wouldn&rsquo;t be here now in Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, child, even a <i>Cura</i> cannot always think of good things,
when he sees so much wickedness in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, God is good, isn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo; The necessity to answer could not be avoided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He is everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He had to say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is the wickedness, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;but, <i>chiquita</i>, you don&rsquo;t understand; you are too
young to reason about such things; and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his heart Jos&egrave; knew he spoke not the truth. He felt the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page28' name='book2_page28'></a>28</span>
great brown eyes of the girl penetrate his naked soul; and he
knew that in the dark recesses of the inner man they fell upon
the grinning skeleton of hypocrisy. Carmen might be, doubtless
was, incapable of reasoning. Of logical processes she knew
nothing. But by what crass assumption might he, admittedly
woefully defeated in his combat with Fate, oppose his feeble
shafts of worldly logic to this child&rsquo;s instinct, an instinct of
whose inerrancy her daily walk was a living demonstration?
In quick penitence and humility he stretched out his arm and
drew her unresisting to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little child of God,&rdquo; he murmured, as he bent over
her and touched his lips to her rich brown curls, &ldquo;I have tried
my life long to learn what you already know. And at last I
have been led to you&ndash;&ndash;to you, little one, who shall be a lamp
unto my feet. Dearest child, I want to know your God as you
know Him. I want you to lead me to Him, for you know where
He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is <i>everywhere</i>, Padre dear,&rdquo; whispered the child, as she
nestled close to the priest and stole her soft arms gently about
his neck. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t see Him nor hear Him if we have bad
thoughts, and if we don&rsquo;t love everybody and everything, even
Cucumbra, and Cantar-las-horas, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, I know now,&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
wonder they all love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre dear, I love them&ndash;&ndash;and I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest strained her to him. His famished heart yearned
for love. Love! first of the tender graces which adorned this
beautiful child. Verily, only those imbued with it become the
real teachers of men. The beloved disciple&rsquo;s last instruction to
his dear children was the tender admonition to love one another.
But why, oh, why are we bidden to love the fallen,
sordid outcasts of this wicked world&ndash;&ndash;the wretched, sinning
pariahs&ndash;&ndash;the greedy, grasping, self-centered mass of humanity
that surges about us in such woeful confusion of good and
evil? Because the wise Master did. Because he said that God
was Love. Because he taught that he who loves not, knows
not God. And because, oh, wonderful spiritual alchemy! because
Love is the magical potion which, dropping like heavenly
dew upon sinful humanity, dissolves the vice, the sorrow, the
carnal passions, and transmutes the brutish mortal into the
image and likeness of the perfect God.</p>
<p>Far into the night, while the child slept peacefully in the
bed near him, Jos&egrave; lay thinking of her and of the sharp turn
which she had given to the direction of his life. Through the
warm night air the hoarse croaking of distant frogs and the
mournful note of the toucan floated to his ears. In the street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page29' name='book2_page29'></a>29</span>
without he heard at intervals the pattering of bare feet in the
hot, thick dust, as tardy fishermen returned from their labors.
The hum of insects about his <i>toldo</i> lulled him with its low
monotone. The call of a lonely jaguar drifted across the still
lake from the brooding jungle beyond. A great peace lay over
the ancient town; and when, in the early hours of morning, as
the distorted moon hung low in the western sky, Jos&egrave; awoke,
the soft breathing of the child fell upon his ears like a benediction;
and deep from his heart there welled a prayer&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God&ndash;&ndash;<i>her</i> God&ndash;&ndash;at last I thank Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
</div>
<p>The day following was filled to the brim with bustling activity.
Jos&egrave; plunged into his new life with an enthusiasm
he had never known before. His first care was to relieve
Rosendo and his good wife of the burden of housing him.
Rosendo, protesting against the intimation that the priest could
in any way inconvenience him, at last suggested that the house
adjoining his own, a small, three-room cottage, was vacant, and
might be had at a nominal rental. Some repairs were needed;
the mud had fallen from the walls in several places; but he
would plaster it up again and put it into habitable condition
at once.</p>
<p>During the discussion Don Mario, the Alcalde, called to pay
his respects to Jos&egrave;. He had just returned from a week&rsquo;s visit
to Oca&ntilde;a, whither he had gone on matters of business with
Simit&iacute;&rsquo;s most eminent citizen, Don Felipe Alcozer, who was at
present sojourning there for reasons of health. Learning of the
priest&rsquo;s recent severe illness, Don Mario had hastened at once to
pay his <i>devoirs</i>. And now the Holy Virgin be praised that he
beheld the <i>Cura</i> again fully restored! Yes, the dismal little
house in question belonged to him, but would the <i>Cura</i> graciously
accept it, rent free, and with his most sincere compliments?
Jos&egrave; glanced at Rosendo and, reading a meaning in
the slight shake of his head, replied that, although overwhelmed
by the Alcalde&rsquo;s kindness, he could take the cottage only on
the condition that it should become the parish house, which
the Church must support. A shade of disappointment seemed
to cross the heavy face of Don Mario, but he graciously acquiesced
in the priest&rsquo;s suggestion; and arrangements were at
once concluded whereby the house became the dwelling place
of the new <i>Cura</i>.</p>
<p>Rosendo thereupon sent out a call for assistants, to which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page30' name='book2_page30'></a>30</span>
the entire unemployed male population of the town responded.
Mud for the walls was hastily brought from the lake, and mixed
with manure and dried grass. A half dozen young men started
for the islands to cut fresh thatch for the roof. Others set
about scraping the hard dirt floors; while Don Mario gave
orders which secured a table, several rough chairs, together
with iron stewpans and a variety of enameled metal dishes, all
of which Rosendo insisted should be charged against the parish.
The village carpenter, with his rusty tools and rough, undressed
lumber, constructed a bed in one of the rooms; and Juan, the
boatman, laboriously sought out stones of the proper shape
and size to support the cooking utensils in the primitive dirt
hearth.</p>
<p>Often, as he watched the progress of these arrangements,
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thoughts reverted longingly to his father&rsquo;s comfortable
house in far-off Seville; to his former simple quarters in Rome;
and to the less pretentious, but still wholly sufficient <i>m&eacute;nage</i>
of Cartagena. Compared with this primitive dwelling and the
simple husbandry which it would shelter, his former abodes
and manner of life had been extravagantly luxurious. At times
he felt a sudden sinking of heart as he reflected that perhaps
he should never again know anything better than the lowly
life of this dead town. But when his gaze rested upon the
little Carmen, flying hither and yon with an ardent, anticipatory
interest in every detail of the preparations, and when he realized
that, though her feet seemed to rest in the squalid setting
afforded by this dreary place, yet her thought dwelt ever in
heaven, his heart welled again with a great thankfulness for
the inestimable privilege of giving his new life, in whatever
environment, to a soul so fair as hers.</p>
<p>While his house was being set in order under the direction
of Rosendo, Jos&egrave; visited the church with the Alcalde to formulate
plans for its immediate repair and renovation. As he
surveyed the ancient pile and reflected that it stood as a monument
to the inflexible religious convictions of his own distant
progenitors, the priest&rsquo;s sensibilities were profoundly stirred.
How little he knew of that long line of illustrious ancestry
which preceded him! He had been thrust from under the
parental wing at the tender age of twelve; but he could not
recall that even before that event his father had ever made
more than casual mention of the family. Indeed, in the few
months since arriving on ancestral soil Jos&egrave; had gathered up
more of the threads which bound him to the ancient house of
Rinc&oacute;n than in all the years which preceded. Had he himself
only been capable of the unquestioning acceptance of religious
dogma which those old <i>Conqueros</i> and early forbears exhibited,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page31' name='book2_page31'></a>31</span>
to what position of eminence in Holy Church might he not
already have attained, with every avenue open to still greater
preferment! How happy were his dear mother then! How
glorious their honored name!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>With a sigh the priest roused himself and strove to thrust
these disturbing thoughts from his mind by centering his attention
upon the work in hand. Do&ntilde;a Maria came to him for
permission to take the moldy vestments from the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i> to
her house to clean them. The Alcalde, bustling about, panting
and perspiring, was distributing countless orders among his
willing assistants. Carmen, who throughout the morning had
been everywhere, bubbling with enthusiasm, now appeared at
the church door. As she entered the musty, ill-smelling old
building she hesitated on the threshold, her childish face
screwed into an expression of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, little one; I need your inspiration,&rdquo; called Jos&egrave;
cheerily.</p>
<p>The child approached, and slipped her hand into his.
&ldquo;Padre Rosendo says this is God&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she commented,
looking up at Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;He says you are going to talk about God
here&ndash;&ndash;in this dirty, smelly old place! Why don&rsquo;t you talk about
Him out of doors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was becoming innured to the embarrassment which her
direct questions occasioned. And he was learning not to dissemble
in his replies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because the people want to come here, dear one; it is
their custom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would the people believe that the wafer and wine could be
changed into the flesh and blood of Jesus elsewhere&ndash;&ndash;even in
Nature&rsquo;s temple?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to come here!&rdquo; she asseverated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a naughty thing to say to the good <i>Cura</i>, child!&rdquo;
interposed Don Mario, who had overheard the girl&rsquo;s remark.
&ldquo;You see, Padre, how we need a <i>Cura</i> here to save these children;
otherwise the Church is going to lose them. They are
running pretty wild, and especially this one. She is already
dedicated to the Church; but she will have to learn to speak
more reverently of holy things if she expects to become a good
Sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child looked uncomprehendingly from, one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dedicated her to the Church?&rdquo; demanded Jos&egrave;
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre Diego, at her baptism, when she was a baby,&rdquo;
replied Don Mario in a matter of fact tone.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; shuddered at the thought of that unholy man&rsquo;s loathsome
hands resting upon the innocent girl. But he made no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page32' name='book2_page32'></a>32</span>
immediate reply. Of all things, he knew that the guarding of
his own tongue was now most important. But his thought was
busy with Rosendo&rsquo;s burning words of the preceding day, and
with his own solemn vow. He reflected on his present paradoxical,
hazardous position; on the tremendous problem which
here confronted him; and on his desperate need of wisdom&ndash;&ndash;yea,
superhuman wisdom&ndash;&ndash;to ward off from this child the net
which he knew the subtlety and cruel cunning of shrewd, unscrupulous
men would some day cause to be cast about her. A
soul like hers, mirrored in a body so wondrous fair, must
eventually draw the devil&rsquo;s most envenomed barbs.</p>
<p>To Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s great relief Don Mario turned immediately from
the present topic to one relating to the work of renovation.
Finding a pretext for sending Carmen back to the house, the
priest gave his attention unreservedly to the Alcalde. But his
mind ceased not to revolve the implications in Don Mario&rsquo;s
words relative to the girl; and when the midday <i>siesta</i> came
upon him his brow was knotted and his eyes gazed vacantly
at the manifestations of activity about him.</p>
<p>Hurrying across the road to escape the scalding heat, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
ears again caught the sound of singing, issuing evidently from
Rosendo&rsquo;s house. It was very like the clear, sweet voice which
had floated into his room the morning after he awoke from
his delirium. He approached the door reverently and looked
in. Carmen was arranging the few poor dishes upon the rough
table, and as she worked, her soul flowed across her lips
in song.</p>
<p>The man listened astonished. The words and the simple
melody which carried them were evidently an improvisation.
But the voice&ndash;&ndash;did that issue from a human throat? Yes, for
in distant Spain and far-off Rome, in great cathedrals and concert
halls, he had sometimes listened entranced to voices like
this&ndash;&ndash;stronger, and delicately trained, but reared upon even less
of primitive talent.</p>
<p>The girl caught sight of him; and the song died on the warm
air.</p>
<p>The priest strode toward her and clasped her in his arms.
&ldquo;Carmen, child! Who taught you to sing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled up in his face. &ldquo;God, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course! He should have known. And in future he need
never ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose He tells you when to sing, too, as He does
Cantar-las-horas?&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, smiling in amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; was the unaffected answer. &ldquo;He just sings
Himself in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man felt rebuked for his light remark; and a lump rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page33' name='book2_page33'></a>33</span>
in his throat. He looked again into her fair face with a deep
yearning.</p>
<p>Oh, ye of little faith! Did you but know&ndash;&ndash;could you but
realize&ndash;&ndash;that the kingdom of heaven is within you, would not
celestial melody flow from your lips, too?</p>
<p>Throughout the afternoon, while he labored with his willing
helpers in the church building and his homely cottage, the
child&rsquo;s song lingered in his brain, like the memory of a sweet
perfume. His eyes followed her lithe, graceful form as she flitted
about, and his mind was busy devising pretexts for keeping
her near him. At times she would steal up close to him and
put her little hand lovingly and confidingly into his own. Then
as he looked down into her upturned face, wreathed with smiles
of happiness, his breath would catch, and he would turn hurriedly
away, that she might not see the tears which suffused
his eyes.</p>
<p>When night crept down, unheralded, from the <i>Sierras</i>, the
priest&rsquo;s house stood ready for its occupant. Cantar-las-horas
had dedicated it by singing the <i>Angelus</i> at the front door, for the
hour of six had overtaken him as he stood, with cocked head,
peering curiously within. The dwelling, though pitifully bare,
was nevertheless as clean as these humble folk with the primitive
means at their command could render it. Instead of the
customary hard <i>macana</i> palm strips for the bed, Rosendo had
thoughtfully substituted a large piece of tough white canvas,
fastened to a rectangular frame, which rested on posts well
above the damp floor. On this lay a white sheet and a light
blanket of red flannel. Rosendo had insisted that, for the
present, Jos&egrave; should take his meals with him. The priest&rsquo;s
domestic arrangements, therefore, would be simple in the extreme;
and Do&ntilde;a Maria quietly announced that these were in
her charge. The church edifice would not be in order for some
days yet, perhaps a week. But of this Jos&egrave; was secretly glad,
for he regarded with dread the necessity of discharging the
priestly functions. And yet, upon that hinged his stay in Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute; has two churches, you know, Padre,&rdquo; remarked
Rosendo during the evening meal. &ldquo;There is another old one
near the eastern edge of town. If you wish, we can visit it
while there is yet light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; expressed his pleasure; and a few minutes later the
two men, with Carmen dancing along happily beside them, were
climbing the shaly eminence upon the summit of which stood
the second church. On the way they passed the town cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spanish cemetery never grows,&rdquo; commented Jos&egrave;,
stopping at the crumbling gateway and peering in. The place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page34' name='book2_page34'></a>34</span>
of sepulture was the epitome of utter desolation. A tumbled
brick wall surrounded it, and there were a few broken brick
vaults, in some of which whitening bones were visible. In a
far corner was a heap of human bones and bits of decayed
coffins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their rent fell due, Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo with a little
laugh, indicating the bones. &ldquo;The Church rents this ground to
the people&ndash;&ndash;it is consecrated, you know. And if the payments
are not made, why, the bones come up and are thrown over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Worse than heathenish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see, Padre, the Church is only concerned with
souls. And it is better to pay the money to get souls out of
purgatory than to rent a bit of ground for the body, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; wisely vouchsafed no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Padre,&rdquo; continued Rosendo. &ldquo;I would not want to
have to spend the night here. For, you know, if a man spends
a night in a cemetery an evil spirit settles upon him&ndash;&ndash;is it
not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; still kept silence before the old man&rsquo;s inbred superstition.
A few minutes later they stood before the old church.
It was in the Spanish mission style, but smaller than the one
in the central <i>plaza</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was built in the time of your great-grandfather, Padre,
the father of Don Ignacio,&rdquo; offered Rosendo. &ldquo;The Rinc&oacute;n
family had many powerful enemies throughout the country,
and those in Simit&iacute; even carried their ill feeling so far as to
refuse to hear Mass in the church which your family built. So
they erected this one. No one ever enters it now. Strange
noises are sometimes heard inside, and the people are afraid to
go in. You see there are no houses built near it. They say an
angel of the devil lives here and thrashes around at times in
terrible anger. There is a story that many years ago, when I
was but a baby, the devil&rsquo;s angel came and entered this church
one dark night, when there was a terrible storm and the waves
of the lake were so strong that they tossed the crocodiles far
up on the shore. And when the bad angel saw the candles
burning on the altar before the sacred wafer he roared in anger
and blew them out. But there was a beautiful painting of the
Virgin on the wall, and when the lights went out she came down
out of her picture and lighted the candles again. But the devil&rsquo;s
angel blew them out once more. And then, they say, the Holy
Virgin left the church in darkness and went out and locked
the wicked angel in, where he has been ever since. That was
to show her displeasure against the enemies of the great Rinc&oacute;ns
for erecting this church. The <i>Cura</i> died suddenly that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page35' name='book2_page35'></a>35</span>
night; and the church has never been used since The Virgin,
you know, is the special guardian Saint of the Rinc&oacute;n family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not believe the story, Rosendo?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo; was the noncommittal reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think the Virgin could or would do such a
thing, Rosendo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Padre? She has the same power as God, has she
not? The frame which held her picture&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;reverting again to
the story&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;was found out in front of the church the next
morning; but the picture itself was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; glanced down at Carmen, who had been listening with
a tense, rapt expression on her face. What impression did this
strange story make upon her? She looked up at the priest with
a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go in, Padre,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; commanded Rosendo, seizing her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid, Rosendo?&rdquo; queried the amused Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I would&ndash;&ndash;rather not,&rdquo; the old man replied hesitatingly.
&ldquo;The Virgin has sealed it.&rdquo; Physical danger was temperamental
to this noble son of the jungle; yet the religious superstition
which Spain had bequeathed to this oppressed land still
shackled his limbs.</p>
<p>As they descended the hill Carmen seized an opportunity
to speak to Jos&egrave; alone. &ldquo;Some day, Padre,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;you and I will open the door and let the bad angel out, won&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; pressed her little hand. He knew that the door of his
own mind had swung wide at her bidding in these few days,
and many a bad angel had gone out forever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>
</div>
<p>The dawn of a new day broke white and glistering upon
the ancient <i>pueblo</i>. From their hard beds of palm, and
their straw mats on the dirt floors, the provincial dwellers
in this abandoned treasure house of Old Spain rose already
dressed to resume the monotonous routine of their lowly life.
The duties which confronted them were few, scarce extending
beyond the procurement of their simple food. And for all,
excepting the two or three families which constituted the
shabby aristocracy of Simit&iacute;, this was limited in the extreme.
Indian corn, <i>panela</i>, and coffee, with an occasional addition of
<i>platanos</i> or rice, and now and then bits of <i>bagre</i>, the coarse fish
yielded by the adjacent lake, constituted the staple diet of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page36' name='book2_page36'></a>36</span>
average citizen of this decayed hamlet. A few might purchase
a bit of lard at rare intervals; and this they hoarded like
precious jewels. Some occasionally had wheat flour; but the
long, difficult transportation, and its rapid deterioration in that
hot, moist climate, where swarms of voracious insects burrow
into everything not cased in tin or iron, made its cost all but
prohibitive. A few had goats and chickens. Some possessed
pigs. And the latter even exceeded in value the black, naked
babes that played in the hot dust of the streets with them.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was up at dawn. Standing in the warm, unadulterated
sunlight in his doorway he watched the village awaken. At a
door across the <i>plaza</i> a woman appeared, smoking a cigar, with
the lighted end in her mouth. Jos&egrave; viewed with astonishment
this curious custom which prevails in the <i>Tierra Caliente</i>. He
had observed that in Simit&iacute; nearly everybody of both sexes was
addicted to the use of tobacco, and it was no uncommon sight
to see children of tender age smoking heavy, black cigars with
keen enjoyment. From another door issued two fishermen,
who, seeing the priest, approached and asked his blessing on
their day&rsquo;s work. Some moments later he heard a loud tattoo,
and soon the Alcalde of the village appeared, marching pompously
through the streets, preceded by his tall, black secretary,
who was beating lustily upon a small drum. At each street
intersection the little procession halted, while the Alcalde with
great impressiveness sonorously read a proclamation just received
from the central Government at Bogot&aacute; to the effect that
thereafter no cattle might be killed in the country without the
payment of a tax as therein set forth. Groups of <i>peones</i> gathered
slowly about the few little stores in the main street, or
entered and inspected for the thousandth time the shabby
stocks. Matrons with black, shining faces cheerily greeted
one another from their doorways. Everywhere prevailed a
gentle decorum of speech and manners. For, however lowly
the station, however pinched the environment, the dwellers in
this ancient town were ever gentle, courteous and dignified.
Their conversation dealt with the simple affairs of their quiet
life. They knew nothing of the complex problems, social, economic,
or religious, which harassed their brethren of the North.
No dubious aspirations or ambitions stirred their breasts.
Nothing of the frenzied greed and lust of material accumulation
touched their child-like minds. They dwelt upon a plane
far, far removed, in whatever direction, from the mental state
of their educated and civilized brothers of the great States,
who from time to time undertake to advise them how to live,
while ruthlessly exploiting them for material gain. And thus
they have been exploited ever since the heavy hand of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page37' name='book2_page37'></a>37</span>
Spaniard was laid upon them, four centuries ago. Thus they
will continue to be, until that distant day when mankind shall
have learned to find their own in another&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>As his eyes swept his environment, the untutored folk, the
old church, the dismally decrepit mud houses, with an air of
desolation and utter abandon brooding over all; and as he reflected
that his own complex nature, rather than any special
malice of fortune, had brought this to him, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart began
to sink under the sting of a condemning conscience. He turned
back into his house. Its pitiful emptiness smote him sore. No
books, no pictures, no furnishings, nothing that ministers to
the comfort of a civilized and educated man! And yet, amid
this barrenness he had resolved to live.</p>
<p>A song drifted to him through the pulsing heat of the morning
air. It sifted through the mud walls of his poor dwelling,
and poured into the open doorway, where it hovered, quivering,
like the dust motes in the sunbeams. Instantly the man righted
himself. It was Carmen, the child to whom his life now belonged.
Resolutely he again set his wandering mind toward
the great thing he would accomplish&ndash;&ndash;the protection and training
of this girl, even while, if might be, he found his life again
in hers. Nothing on earth should shake him from that purpose!
Doubt and uncertainty were powerless to dull the edge
of his efforts. His bridges were burned behind him; and on
the other side of the great gulf lay the dead self which he had
abandoned forever.</p>
<p>A harsh medley of loud, angry growls, interspersed with
shrill yelps, suddenly arose before his house, and Jos&egrave; hastened
to the door just in time to see Carmen rush into the street and
fearlessly throw herself upon two fighting dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cucumbra! Stop it instantly!&rdquo; she exclaimed, dragging
the angry brute from a thoroughly frightened puppy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame! shame! And after all I&rsquo;ve talked to you about
loving that puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gaunt animal slunk down, with its tail between its
legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever gain anything at all by fighting? You know
you never did! And right down in your heart you know you
love that puppy. You&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to love him; you can&rsquo;t help it!
And you might as well begin right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beast whimpered at her little bare feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cucumbra, you let bad thoughts use you, didn&rsquo;t you? Yes,
you did; and you&rsquo;re sorry for it now. Well, there&rsquo;s the puppy,&rdquo;
pointing to the little dog, which stood hesitant some yards
away. &ldquo;Now go and play with him,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Play with
him!&rdquo; rousing the larger dog and pointing toward the puppy.
&ldquo;Play with him! You <i>know</i> you love him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page38' name='book2_page38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>Cucumbra hesitated, looking alternately at the small, resolute
girl and the smaller dog. Her arm remained rigidly extended,
and determination was written large in her set features.
The puppy uttered a sharp bark, as if in forgiveness, and
began to scamper playfully about. Cucumbra threw a final
glance at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play with him!&rdquo; she again commanded.</p>
<p>The large dog bounded after the puppy, and together they
disappeared around the street corner.</p>
<p>The child turned and saw Jos&egrave;, who had regarded the scene
in mute astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy buenos dias, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; dropping a little courtesy.
&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t Cucumbra foolish to have bad thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&ndash;&ndash;he certainly is,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; slowly, hard
pressed by the unusual question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has just <i>got</i> to love that puppy, or else he will never
be happy, will he, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why would this girl persist in ending her statements with
an interrogation! How could he know whether Cucumbra&rsquo;s
happiness would be imperfect if he failed in love toward the
puppy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you know, Padre,&rdquo; the child continued, coming
up to him and slipping her hand into his, &ldquo;padre Rosendo once
told me that God was Love; and after that I knew we just had
to love everything and everybody, or else He can&rsquo;t see us&ndash;&ndash;can
He, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He can&rsquo;t see us&ndash;&ndash;if we don&rsquo;t love everything and everybody!
Well! Jos&egrave; wondered what sort of interpretation the Vatican,
with its fiery hatred of heretics, would put upon this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can He, Padre?&rdquo; insisted the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, in these matters you are teaching me; not I
you,&rdquo; replied the noncommittal priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, you are going to teach the people in the
church,&rdquo; the girl ventured quizzically.</p>
<p>Ah, so he was! And he had wondered what. In his hour of
need the answer was vouchsafed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest child&ndash;&ndash;and I am going to teach them what I
learn from <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen regarded him for a moment uncertainly. &ldquo;But,
padre Rosendo says you are to teach <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she averred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I am, little one,&rdquo; the priest replied; &ldquo;but not one
half as much as I shall learn from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria&rsquo;s summons to breakfast interrupted the conversation.
Throughout the repast Jos&egrave; felt himself subjected
to the closest scrutiny by Carmen. What was running through
her thought, he could only vaguely surmise. But he instinctively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page39' name='book2_page39'></a>39</span>
felt that he was being weighed and appraised by this
strange child, and that she was finding him wanting in her
estimate of what manner of man a priest of God ought to be.
And yet he knew that she embraced him in her great love.
Oftentimes his quick glance at her would find her serious
gaze bent upon him. But whenever their eyes met, her sweet
face would instantly relax and glow with a smile of tenderest
love&ndash;&ndash;a love which, he felt, was somehow, in some way, destined
to reconstruct his shattered life.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s plans for educating the girl had gradually evolved
into completion during the past two days. He explained them
at length to Rosendo after the morning meal; and the latter,
with dilating eyes, manifested his great joy by clasping the
priest in his brawny arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember, Rosendo,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; said, &ldquo;learning is not <i>knowing</i>.
I can only teach her book-knowledge. But even now, an
untutored child, she knows more that is real than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Padre, have I not told you many times that she is not
like us? And now you know it!&rdquo; exclaimed the emotional
Rosendo, his eyes suffused with tears of joy as he beheld his
cherished ideals and his longing of years at last at the point of
realization. What he, too, had instinctively seen in the child
was now to be summoned forth; and the vague, half-understood
motive which had impelled him to take the abandoned
babe from Badillo into the shelter of his own great heart would
at length be revealed. The man&rsquo;s joy was ecstatic. With a
final clasp of the priest&rsquo;s hand, he rushed from the house to
plunge into the work in progress at the church.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; summoned Carmen into the quiet of his own dwelling.
She came joyfully, bringing an ancient and obsolete arithmetic
and a much tattered book, which Jos&egrave; discovered to be a chronicle
of the heroic deeds of the early <i>Conquistadores</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through decimals!&rdquo; she exclaimed with glistening
eyes; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve read some of this, but I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; making
a little <i>moue</i> of disgust and holding aloft the battered history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo told me to show it to you,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;But it is all about murder, you know. And yet,&rdquo; with a little
sigh, &ldquo;he has nothing else to read, excepting old newspapers
which the steamers sometimes leave at Bodega Central. And
they are all about murder, and stealing, and bad things, too.
Padre, why don&rsquo;t people write about good things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; gazed at her reverently, as of old the sculptor Phidias
might have stood in awe before the vision which he saw in the
unchiseled marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo helped me with the fractions,&rdquo; went on the
girl, flitting lightly to another topic; &ldquo;but I had to learn the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page40' name='book2_page40'></a>40</span>
decimals myself. He couldn&rsquo;t understand them. And they are
so easy, aren&rsquo;t they? I just love arithmetic!&rdquo; hugging the old
book to her little bosom.</p>
<p>Both volumes, printed in Madrid, were reliques of Spanish
colonial days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read to me, Carmen,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, handing her the history.</p>
<p>The child took the book and began to read, with clear enunciation,
the narrative of Quesada&rsquo;s sanguinary expedition to
Bogot&aacute;, undertaken in the name of the gentle Christ. Jos&egrave;
wondered as he listened what interpretation this fresh young
mind would put upon the motives of that renowned exploit.
Suddenly she snapped the book shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Jesus,&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>The precipitation with which the question had been propounded
almost took his breath away. He raised his eyes to
hers, and looked long and wonderingly into their infinite
depths. And then the vastness of the problem enunciated by
her demand loomed before him. What, after all, did he know
about Jesus? Had he not arrived in Simit&iacute; in a state of agnosticism
regarding religion? Had he not come there enveloped
in confusion, baffled, beaten, hopeless? And then, after his
wonderful talk with Rosendo, had he not agreed with him that
the child&rsquo;s thought must be kept free and open&ndash;&ndash;that her own
instinctive religious ideas must be allowed to develop normally,
unhampered and unfettered by the external warp and bias of
human speculation? It was part of his plan that all reference
to matters theological should be omitted from Carmen&rsquo;s educational
scheme. Yet here was that name on her lips&ndash;&ndash;the first
time he had ever heard it voiced by her. And it smote him like
a hammer. He made haste to divert further inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, little one,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;I want to hear you
read more from your book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied firmly, laying the volume upon the table.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it; and I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would, either. Besides,
it isn&rsquo;t true; it never really happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it is true, child! It is history, the story of
how the brave Spaniards came into this country long ago. We
will read a great deal more about them later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; with a decisive shake of her brown head; &ldquo;not if it is
like this. It isn&rsquo;t true; I told padre Rosendo it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you mean, child?&rdquo; asked the uncomprehending
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a lot of bad thoughts printed in a book,&rdquo; she
replied slowly. &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t true, because God is <i>everywhere</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly the man was encountering difficulties at the outset;
and a part, at least, of his well-ordered curriculum stood in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page41' name='book2_page41'></a>41</span>
grave danger of repudiation at the hands of this earnest little
maid.</p>
<p>The girl stood looking at him wistfully. Then her sober
little face melted in smiles. With childish impulsiveness she
clambered into his lap, and twining her arms about his neck,
impressed a kiss upon his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, Padre,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;and you love me,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed her to him, startled though he was. &ldquo;God knows
I do, little one!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course He does,&rdquo; she eagerly agreed; &ldquo;and He knows
you don&rsquo;t want to teach me anything that isn&rsquo;t true, doesn&rsquo;t
He, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yea, and more; for Jos&egrave; was realizing now, what he had not
seen before, that <i>it was beyond his power to teach her that
which was not true</i>. The magnitude and sacredness of his task
impressed him as never before. His puzzled brain grappled
feebly with the enormous problem. She had rebuked him for
trying to teach her things which, if he accepted the immanence
of God as fact, her logic had shown him were utterly false.
Clearly the grooves in which this child&rsquo;s pure thought ran
were not his own. And if she would not think as he did, what
recourse was there left him but to accept the alternative and
think with her? For he would not, even if he could, force upon
her his own thought-processes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Carmen,&rdquo; he finally ventured, &ldquo;you do not wish to
learn about people and what they have done and are doing in
the big world about you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Padre; tell me all about the good things they did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did many wicked things too, <i>chiquita</i>. And the
good and the bad are all mixed up together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head vigorously; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t any bad.
There is only good, for God is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised up and looked squarely into the priest&rsquo;s eyes.
Dissimulation, hypocrisy, quibble, cant&ndash;&ndash;nothing but fearless
truth could meet that gaze.</p>
<p>Suddenly a light broke in upon his clouded thought. This
girl&ndash;&ndash;this tender plant of God&ndash;&ndash;why, she had shown it from the
very beginning! And he, oh, blind that he was! he could not
see nor accept it. The secret of her power, of her ecstasy of
life&ndash;&ndash;what was it but this?&ndash;&ndash;<i>she knew no evil!</i></p>
<p>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, &ldquo;Of every
tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, great God! It was the first&ndash;&ndash;the very first&ndash;&ndash;lesson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page42' name='book2_page42'></a>42</span>
which Thou didst teach Thy child, Israel, as the curtain rose
upon the drama of human life! And the awful warning has
rung down through the corridors of time from the mouths of
the prophets, whom we slew lest they wake us from our mesmeric
sleep! Israel forgot Thy words; and the world has forgotten
them, long, long since. Daily we mix our perfumed
draft of good and evil, and sink under its lethal influence!
Hourly we eat of the forbidden tree, till the pangs of death encompass
us!</p>
<p>And when at last the dark angel hovered over the sin-stricken
earth and claimed it for his own, the great Master
came to sound again the warning&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;As a man thinketh in his
heart, <i>so is he</i>!&rdquo; But they would have none of him, and nailed
him to a tree!</p>
<p>Oh, Jerusalem! Oh, ye incarnate human mind! Even the
unique Son of God wept as he looked with yearning upon you!
Why? Because of your stubborn clinging to false ways, false
beliefs, false thoughts of God and man! Because ye would not
be healed; ye would not be made whole! Ye loved evil&ndash;&ndash;ye gave
it life and power, and ye rolled it like a sweet morsel beneath
your tongue&ndash;&ndash;and so ye died! So came death into this fair
world, through the heart, the brain, the mind of man, <i>who
sought to know what God could not</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, you are so quiet.&rdquo; The girl nestled closer to
the awed priest. Aye! And so the multitude on Sinai had stood
in awed quiet as they listened to the voice of God.</p>
<p>This child knew no evil! The man could not grasp the infinite
import of the marvelous fact. And yet he had sought to
teach her falsities&ndash;&ndash;to teach her that evil did exist, as real and
as potent as good, and that it was to be accepted and honored
by mankind! But she had turned her back upon the temptation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, are you going to tell me about Jesus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest roused from his deep meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&ndash;&ndash;I want to know nothing else! I will get my Bible,
and we will read about him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bible? What is that, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t know what the Bible is?&rdquo; cried the astonished
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you never&ndash;&ndash;has your padre Rosendo never told
you that it is the book that tells&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the girl shook her head. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; her face kindling,
&ldquo;he told me that Jesus was God&rsquo;s only son. But we are all His
children, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;especially you, little one! But Jesus was the greatest&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page43' name='book2_page43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jesus write the Bible, Padre?&rdquo; the girl asked earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;we don&rsquo;t know who did. People used to think God
wrote it; but I guess He didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will not read it, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bent reverently over the little brown head and
prayed again for guidance. What could he do with this child,
who dwelt with Jehovah&ndash;&ndash;who saw His reflection in every flower
and hill and fleecy cloud&ndash;&ndash;who heard His voice in the sough
of the wind, and the ripple of the waters on the pebbly shore!
And, oh, that some one had bent over him and prayed for
guidance when he was a tender lad and his heart burned with
yearning for truth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;God wrote the arithmetic&ndash;&ndash;I mean, He told people how to
write it, didn&rsquo;t He, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely the priest could acquiesce in this, for mathematics
is purely metaphysical, and without guile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>. And we will go right through this little
book. Then, if I can, I will send for others that will teach you
wonderful things about what we call mathematics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child smiled her approval. The priest had now found
the only path which she would tread with him, and he continued
with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God taught people how to talk, little one; but they
don&rsquo;t all talk as we do. There is a great land up north of us,
which we call the United States, and there the people would not
understand us, for we speak Spanish. I must teach you their
language, <i>chiquita</i>, and I must teach you others, too, for you
will not always live in Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to stay here always, Padre. I love Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, Carmen; God has work for you out in His big world.
You have something to tell His people some day, a message for
them. But you and I have much work to do here first. And so
we will begin with the arithmetic and English. Later we will
study other languages, and we will talk them to each other
until you speak them as fluently as your own. And meanwhile,
I will tell you about the great countries of the world, and about
the people that live in them. And we will study about the
stars, and the rocks, and the animals; and we will read and
work and read and work all day long, every day!&rdquo; The priest&rsquo;s
face was aglow with animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, when shall I have time to think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you will be thinking all the time, child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand. I have to think about other
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked at her with a puzzled expression. &ldquo;What other
things do you have to think about, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page44' name='book2_page44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;About all the people here who are sick and unhappy, and
who quarrel and don&rsquo;t love one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think about people when they are sick?&rdquo; he asked
with heightened curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, always!&rdquo; she replied vigorously &ldquo;When they are sick
I go where nobody can find me and then just think that it isn&rsquo;t
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; the priest ejaculated, his astonishment soaring
Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when people are sick it is really so, isn&rsquo;t it, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; emphatically. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&ndash;&ndash;not if God is everywhere.
Does He make them sick?&rdquo; The child drove the heart-searching
question straight into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;no, I can&rsquo;t say that He does. And yet they somehow
get sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they think bad things, Padre. Because they don&rsquo;t
think about God. They don&rsquo;t think He is here. And they don&rsquo;t
care about Him&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t love Him. And so they get sick,&rdquo;
she explained succinctly.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s mind reverted to what Rosendo had told him. When
he lay tossing in delirium Carmen had said that he would not
die. And yet that was perfectly logical, if she refused to admit
the existence of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought lots about you last week, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft voice was close to his ear, and every breath swept
over his heartstrings and made them vibrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every night when I went to sleep I told God I <i>knew</i> He
would cure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast.</p>
<p>Verily, I have not seen such faith, no, not in Israel! And
the faith of this child had glorified her vision until she saw
&ldquo;the heavens open and the angels of God ascending and descending
upon the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the priest spoke reverently&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;do the sick ones
always get well when you think about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a shade of euphemism in the unhesitating
reply&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are never really sick, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by that you mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They only have bad thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick thoughts, then?&rdquo; he suggested by way of drawing out
her full meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre&ndash;&ndash;for God, you know, really <i>is</i> everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;What put such ideas into your
little head? Who told you these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brown eyes looked full into his own. &ldquo;God, Padre
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page45' name='book2_page45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>God! Yes, of a verity she spoke truth. For nothing but her
constant communion with Him could have filled her pure
thought with a deeper, truer lore than man has ever quaffed at
the world&rsquo;s great fountains of learning. He himself, trained
by Holy Church, deeply versed in letters, science, and theology,
grounded in all human learning, sat in humility at her feet,
drinking in what his heart told him he had at length found&ndash;&ndash;Truth.</p>
<p>He had one more question to ask. &ldquo;Carmen, how do you
know, how are you sure, that He told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is true, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just how do you know that it is true?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;it comes out that way; just like the answers to
the problems in arithmetic. I used to try to see if by thinking
only good thoughts to-day I would be better and happier to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I always was, Padre. And so now I don&rsquo;t think anything
but good thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is, you think only about God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always think about Him <i>first</i>, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no further need to question her proofs, for he knew
she was taught by the Master himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all for this morning, Carmen,&rdquo; he said quietly,
as he put her down. &ldquo;Leave me now. I, too, have some thinking
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Carmen left him, Jos&egrave; lapsed into profound meditation.
Musing over his life experiences, he at last summed them
all up in the vain attempt to evolve an acceptable concept of
God, an idea of Him that would satisfy. He had felt that in
Christianity he had hold of something beneficent, something
real; but he had never been able to formulate it, nor lift it above
the shadows into the clear light of full comprehension. And
the result of his futile efforts to this end had been agnosticism.
His inability conscientiously to accept the mad reasoning of
theologians and the impudent claims of Rome had been the
stumbling block to his own and his family&rsquo;s dearest earthly
hopes. He knew that popular Christianity was a disfigurement
of truth. He knew that the theological claptrap which the
Church, with such oracular assurance, such indubitable certainty
and gross assumption of superhuman knowledge, handed
out to a suffering world, was a travesty of the divinely simple
teachings of Jesus, and that it had estranged mankind from
their only visible source of salvation, the Bible. He saw more
clearly than ever before that in the actual achievements of
popular theology there had been ridiculously little that a seriously-minded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page46' name='book2_page46'></a>46</span>
man could accept as supports to its claims to be
a divinely revealed scheme of salvation. Yet there was no vital
question on which certainty was so little demanded, and seemingly
of so little consequence, as this, even though the joints of
the theologians&rsquo; armor flapped wide to the assaults of unprejudiced
criticism.</p>
<p>But if the slate were swept clean&ndash;&ndash;if current theological
dogma were overthrown, and the stage set anew&ndash;&ndash;what could
be reared in their stead? Is it true that the Bible is based upon
propositions which can be verified by all? The explorer in Cartagena
had given Jos&egrave; a new thought in Arnold&rsquo;s concept of
God as &ldquo;the Eternal, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness.&rdquo;
And it was not to be denied that, from first to last, the
Bible is a call to righteousness.</p>
<p>But what is righteousness? Ethical conduct? Assuredly
something vastly more profound, for even that &ldquo;misses the
mark.&rdquo; No, righteousness was right conduct until the marvelous
Jesus appeared. But he swept it at once from the material
into the mental; from the outward into the inward; and
defined it as <i>right-thinking</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righteousness!&rdquo; murmured Jos&egrave;, sitting with head buried
in his hands. &ldquo;Aye, the whole scheme of salvation is held in
that one word! And the wreck of my life has been caused by
my blind ignorance of its tremendous meaning! For righteousness
is salvation. But Carmen, wise little soul, divined it instinctively;
for, if there is one thing that is patent, it is that if
a thing is evil it does not exist for her. Righteousness! Of
course it means <i>thinking no evil</i>! Jesus lived his thorough understanding
of it. And so does Carmen. And so would the
world, but for the withering influence of priestly authority!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Carmen reappeared to summon him to
lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little girl,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, drawing her to him. &ldquo;You
asked me to tell you about Jesus. He was the greatest and best
man that ever lived. And it was because he never had a bad
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know that God was everywhere?&rdquo; The little face
turned lovingly up to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, sweet child. And so do I&ndash;&ndash;now; for I have found
Him even in desolate Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>
</div>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s studies began in earnest that afternoon. In the
quiet of his humble cottage Jos&egrave;, now &ldquo;a prisoner of the
Lord,&rdquo; opened the door of his mental storehouse and carefully
selected those first bits of knowledge for the foundation
stones on which to rear for her, little by little, a broad education.</p>
<p>He found her a facile learner; her thorough ease in the rudiments
of arithmetic and in the handling of her own language
delighted him. His plan of tutelage, although the result of long
contemplation, and involving many radical ideas regarding the
training of children, ideas which had been slowly developing in
his mind for years, he nevertheless felt in her case to be tentative.
For he was dealing with no ordinary child; and so the
usual methods of instruction were here wholly out of the
question.</p>
<p>But on several points he was already firmly resolved. First,
he would get well below the surface of this child&rsquo;s mind, and
he would endeavor to train her to live in a depth of thought
far, far beneath the froth and superficiality of the every-day
thinking of mankind. Fortunately, she had had no previous
bad training to be counteracted now. Nature had been her only
tutor; and Rosendo&rsquo;s canny wisdom had kept out all human
interference. Her associates in Simit&iacute; were few. Her unusual
and mature thought had set up an intellectual barrier between
herself and the playmates she might have had. Fortunately,
too, Jos&egrave; had now to deal with a child who all her life had
thought vigorously&ndash;&ndash;and, he was forced to conclude, correctly.
Habits of accurate observation and quick and correct interpretation
would not be difficult to form in such a mind. Moreover,
to this end he would aim to maintain her interest at the
point of intensity in every subject undertaken; yet without
forcing, and without sacrifice of the joys of childhood. He
would be, not teacher only, but fellow-student. He would strive
to learn with her to conceive the ideal without losing sight of
the fact that it was a human world in which they dwelt. When
she wished to play, he would play with her. But he would
contrive and direct their amusements so as to carry instruction,
to elucidate and exemplify it, to point morals, and steadily to
contribute to her store of knowledge. His plan was ideal, he
knew. But he could not know then that Nature&ndash;&ndash;if we may
thus call it&ndash;&ndash;had anticipated him, and that the child, long since
started upon the quest for truth, would quickly outstrip him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page48' name='book2_page48'></a>48</span>
in the matter of conceiving the ideal and living in this world of
relative fact with an eye single to the truth which shines so
dimly through it.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew, as he studied Carmen and planned her training,
that whatever instruction he offered her must be without taint
of evil, so far as he might prevent. And yet, the thought of any
attempt to withhold from her a knowledge of evil brought a
sardonic smile to his lips. She had as yet everything to learn
of the world about her. Could such learning be imparted to
her free from error or hypothesis, and apart from the fiat of
the speculative human mind? It must be; for he knew from
experience that she would accept his teaching only as he presented
every apparent fact, every object, every event, as a reflection
in some degree of her immanent God, and subject to
rigid demonstration. Where historical events externalized only
the evil motives of the carnal mind, he must contrive to omit
them entirely, or else present them as unreality, the result of
&ldquo;bad thoughts&rdquo; and forgetfulness of God. In other words, only
as he assumed to be the channel through which God spoke to
her could he hope for success. To impart to her a knowledge
of both good and evil was, at least at present, impossible. To
force it upon her later would be criminal. Moreover, <i>why not
try the audacious experiment of permitting and aiding this
child to grow up without a knowledge of evil</i>?&ndash;&ndash;that is, in her
present conviction that only good is real, potent and permanent,
while evil is impotent illusion and to be met and overcome on
that basis. Would the resultant training make of her a tower
of strength&ndash;&ndash;or would it render her incapable of resisting the
onslaughts of evil when at length she faced the world? His own
heart sanctioned the plan; and&ndash;&ndash;well, the final judgment should
be left to Carmen herself.</p>
<p>The work proceeded joyously. At times Cucumbra interrupted
by bounding in, as if impatient of the attention his little
mistress was giving her tutor. Frequently the inquisitive Cantar-las-horas
stalked through the room, displaying a most dignified
and laudable interest in the proceedings. Late in the afternoon,
when the sun was low, Bosendo appeared at the door. As he
stood listening to Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s narrative of men and places in the outside
world, his eyes bulged. At length his untutored mind became
strained to its elastic limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true, Padre?&rdquo; he could not refrain from interrupting,
when Jos&egrave; had spoken of the fast trains of England. &ldquo;Why,
the Simit&iacute; trail to Tach&iacute; is one hundred and fifty miles long;
and it always took me six days to walk it. And do you say
there are trains that travel that distance in as many hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are trains, Rosendo, that traverse the distance in
three hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page49' name='book2_page49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, it can&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo; cried the incredulous Rosendo,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave us, unbeliever!&rdquo; laughed Jos&egrave;, motioning him away.
&ldquo;I have more pliable material here to handle than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rosendo remained; and it was evident to the priest
that he had come on an errand of importance. Moreover, the
supper hour was at hand, and perhaps Do&ntilde;a Maria needed
Carmen&rsquo;s help. So, dismissing the child, Jos&egrave; turned to Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; he began, as if taking up the thread of a
broken discourse. &ldquo;Carmen <i>was</i> left on the river bank by the
angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do think it was a miracle!&rdquo; said Rosendo in a
voice of awe, as he sank into a chair.</p>
<p>The priest smiled. &ldquo;Everything is a miracle, friend; for a
miracle is simply a sign of God&rsquo;s presence. And finding Carmen
in this musty, forgotten place is one of the greatest. For
where she is, He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, that is true,&rdquo; assented Rosendo gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was led here,&rdquo; continued Jos&egrave;; &ldquo;I see it now. Rosendo,
all my life I have regarded evil as just as real and powerful as
good. And my life has been one of bitterness and woe. Carmen
sees only the good God everywhere. And she dwells in heaven.
What is the logical inference? Simply that my mental attitude
has been all wrong, my views erroneous, my thinking bad. I
have tried to know both good and evil, to eat of the forbidden
tree. And for so doing I was banished from paradise. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;well, no, Padre&ndash;&ndash;that is, I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The honest fellow was
becoming confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just this, then,&rdquo; explained the priest with animation.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t gotten anywhere in life, and neither have you, because
we have limited ourselves and crippled our efforts by
yielding to fear, pride, ignorance, and the belief in evil as a real
power opposed to good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often wondered myself, Padre, how there could be
a devil if God is almighty. For in that case He would have had
to make the devil, wouldn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; enthusiastically. &ldquo;And as He did
make everything, then either He made the devil, or else there
isn&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is pretty hard to see, Padre,&rdquo; replied the puzzled
Rosendo. &ldquo;Something makes us do wicked things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply the belief that there is a power apart from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t that belief come from the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely&ndash;&ndash;the devil of imagination! Listen, Rosendo:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page50' name='book2_page50'></a>50</span>
Carmen is daily putting into practice her instinctive knowledge of
a mighty fact. She will reveal it all to us in due time. Let us
patiently watch her, and try to see and understand and believe
as she does. But in the meantime, let us guard our minds as we
would a treasure house, and strive never to let a thought of
evil get inside! My past life should serve as a perpetual warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo did not reply at once, but sat staring vacantly at
the ground. Jos&egrave; knew that his thoughts were with his wayward
daughter. Then, as if suddenly remembering the object
of his call, he took from his wallet two letters, which he handed
to Jos&egrave; with the comment: &ldquo;Juan brought them up from
Bodega Central this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; took them with quickening pulse. One was from Spain,
from his uncle. He devoured it eagerly. It was six weeks old
when it arrived in Simit&iacute;, and had been written before the news
of his removal from Cartagena had reached Seville. His mother
was well; and her hopes for her son&rsquo;s preferment were steadily
reviving, after the cruel blow which his disgrace in Rome had
given them. For his uncle&rsquo;s part, he hoped that Jos&egrave; had now
seen the futility of opposition to Holy Church, and that, yielding
humbly to her gentle chastisement for the great injury he
had inflicted upon her, he would now make amends and merit
the favors which she was sure to bestow upon him in due season.
To this end the uncle would bring to bear his own influence
and that of His Eminence, the Archbishop of Seville.
The letter closed with an invocation to the Saints and the ever-blessed
Virgin.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; opened the second letter. It was nominally from the
Bishop of Cartagena, although written, he well knew, by Wenceslas.
His Reverence regretted that Jos&egrave; had not come to him
again before leaving Cartagena. He deplored exceedingly the
necessity of assigning him to so lowly a parish; but it was
discipline. His tenure of the parish would be a matter of probation.
Assuming a penitent desire on the part of the priest
to make reparation for past indiscretions, His Grace extended
assurances of his support and tender consideration. And, regarding
him still as a faithful son, he was setting forth herewith
certain instructions which Jos&egrave; would zealously carry out,
to the glory of the sacred Mother Church and the blessed Virgin,
and to his own edification, to wit: In the matter of the confessional
he must be unremittingly zealous, not failing to put
such questions to the people of Simit&iacute; as would draw out their
most secret thoughts. In the present crisis it was especially
necessary to learn their political views. Likewise, he must not
fail to impress upon them the sin of concealing wealth, and of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page51' name='book2_page51'></a>51</span>
withholding contributions to the support of the glorious Mother.
He, as priest of the parish, would be held personally responsible
for the collection of an adequate &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Pence,&rdquo; which must
be sent to Cartagena at frequent intervals for subsequent shipment
to Rome. For all contributions he was to allow liberal
plenary indulgences. In the matter of inciting zeal for the salvation
of those unfortunate souls lingering in the torments of
purgatory, Jos&egrave; must be unflagging. Each family in the parish
should be constantly admonished and threatened, if necessary,
to have Masses said for their deceased members; and he must
forward the proceeds from such Masses at once to Cartagena.
No less important, he must keep constantly before him the great
fact that the hope of the blessed Mother lay in her young. To
this end he must see that all children in his parish were in due
time confirmed, and every effort made to have the females sent
to the convent of Mompox. To encourage his parishioners, he
might assure them of His Reverence&rsquo;s tender regard for them
as his beloved children, and that he had certain special favors
to grant to them in due time. Also, that a statue of the Virgin,
which had arrived from Rome, and which carried the most
potent blessing of the Holy Father, was to be bestowed upon
that church in the diocese which within the next twelve months
should contribute the largest amount of Peter&rsquo;s Pence in proportion
to population. This plan should be especially attractive
to the people of Simit&iacute;, as the town lay on the confines of a district
renowned in the ancient annals for its mineral wealth.
Herein, too, lay a great opportunity for the priest; and His
Reverence rejoiced in the certain knowledge that he would embrace
it. Invoking the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Ever-Blessed
Virgin and Saint Joseph, His Grace awaited with interest
the priest&rsquo;s first report from the parish of Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>The letter fell like a wet blanket upon Jos&egrave;, chilling him to
the marrow, for it revived with cruel poignancy the fact that he
was still a servant of Rome. In the past few happy days he
had dwelt apart from the world in the consciousness of a new
heaven and a new earth, revealed by Carmen. This sudden call
to duty was like a summons from Mephistopheles to the fulfillment
of a forgotten pact.</p>
<p>He carefully read the letter again. Beneath the specious
kindliness of Wenceslas lay sinister motives, he knew. Among
them, greed, of course. But&ndash;&ndash;a darker thought&ndash;&ndash;did Wenceslas
know of Carmen&rsquo;s existence? Could Cartagena have received
any intimation of his plans for her? Refusal to comply
with these instructions meant&ndash;&ndash;he dared not think what! On
the other hand, strict compliance with them certainly was out
of the question.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page52' name='book2_page52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>As for Peter&rsquo;s Pence, what could the impoverished folk of
this decrepit town furnish! And yet, if a reasonable sum
could only be contributed at frequent intervals, would not the
vampire Wenceslas rest content, at least for a while? Oh, for
a fortune of his own, that he might dump it all into the yawning
maw of Holy Church, and thus gain a few years&rsquo; respite
for himself and Carmen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news, Padre?&rdquo; Rosendo inquired, anxiously regarding
the priest&rsquo;s strained features.</p>
<p>What could the man do or say, limited, hounded, and without
resources? Could he force these simple people to buy
Masses? Could he take their money on a pretext which he felt
to be utterly false? Yet Cartagena <i>must</i> be kept quiet at any
hazard!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; he asked earnestly, &ldquo;when you had a priest in
Simit&iacute;, did the people have Masses offered for their dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, we have little money for Masses,&rdquo; replied Rosendo
sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have bought them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At times&ndash;&ndash;long ago&ndash;&ndash;for my first wife, when she died without
a priest, up in the Tigu&iacute; country. But not when Padre
Diego was here. I couldn&rsquo;t see how Masses said by that drunken
priest could please God, or make Him release souls from purgatory&ndash;&ndash;and
Padre Diego was drunk most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; became desperate. &ldquo;Rosendo, we <i>must</i> send money to
the Bishop in Cartagena. I <i>must</i> stay here&ndash;&ndash;I <i>must</i>! And I
can stay only by satisfying Wenceslas! If I can send him
money he will think me too valuable to remove. It is not the
Church, Rosendo, but Wenceslas who is persecuting me. It is
he who has placed me here. He is using the Church for his
own evil ends. It is he who must be placated. But I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t
make these poor people buy Masses! And&ndash;&ndash;but here, read his
letter,&rdquo; thrusting it into Rosendo&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Rosendo shook his head thoughtfully, and a cloud had
gathered over his strong face when he returned the Bishop&rsquo;s
letter to Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, we will be hard pressed to support the church and
you, without buying Masses. There are about two hundred
people here, perhaps fifty families. But they are very, very
poor. Only a few can afford to pay even a <i>peso oro</i> a month to
the schoolmaster to have their children taught. They may be
able to give twenty <i>pesos</i> a month to support you and the
church. But hardly more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Jos&egrave; that his soul must burst under its limitations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, let us take Carmen and flee!&rdquo; he cried wildly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page53' name='book2_page53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How far would we get, Padre? Have you money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Jos&egrave; had nothing. He lapsed into silence-shrouded despair.</p>
<p>The sun dropped below the wooded hills, and Cantar-las-horas
had sung his weird vesper song. Dusk was thickening
into night, though upon the distant <i>Sierras</i> a mellow glow still
illumined the frosted peaks. Moments crept slowly through
the enveloping silence.</p>
<p>Then the mental gloom parted, and through it arose the
great soul of the black-faced man sitting beside the despairing
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo spoke slowly and with deep emotion.
Tears trickled down his swart cheeks&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I am no longer young.
More than sixty years of hardship and heavy toil rest upon me.
My parents&ndash;&ndash;I have not told you this&ndash;&ndash;were slaves. They
worked in the mines of Guamoc&oacute;, under hard masters. They
lived in bamboo huts, and slept on the damp ground. At four
each morning, year after year, they were driven from their
hard beds and sent out to toil under the lash fourteen hours a
day, washing gold from the streams. The gold went to the
building of Cartagena&rsquo;s walls, and to her Bishop, to buy idleness
and luxury for him and his fat priests. When the war
came it lasted thirteen years; but we drove the Christian Spaniards
into the sea! Then my father and mother went back to
Guamoc&oacute;; and there I was born. When I was old enough to
use a <i>batea</i> I, too, washed gold in the Tigu&iacute;, and in the little
streams so numerous in that region. But they had been pretty
well washed out under the Spaniards; and so my father came
down here and made a little <i>hacienda</i> on the hills across the
lake from Simit&iacute;. Then he and my poor mother lay down and
died, worn out with their long years of toil for their cruel masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brushed the tears from his eyes; then resumed: &ldquo;The
district of Guamoc&oacute; gradually became deserted. Revolution
after revolution broke out in this unhappy country, sometimes
stirred up by the priests, sometimes by political agitators who
tried to get control of the Government. The men and boys
went to the wars, and were killed off. Guamoc&oacute; was again
swallowed up by the forest&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, and sat some moments silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been back there many times since, and often I have
washed gold again along the beautiful Tigu&iacute;,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;But the awful loneliness of the jungle, and the memories of
those gloomy days when I toiled there as a boy, and the thoughts
of my poor parents&rsquo; sufferings under the Spaniards, made me
so sad that I could not stay. And then I got too old for that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page54' name='book2_page54'></a>54</span>
kind of work, standing bent over in the cold mountain water
all day long, swinging a <i>batea</i> heavy with gravel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again, and seemed to lose himself in the memory
of those dark days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is still gold in the Tigu&iacute;. I can find it. It means
hard work&ndash;&ndash;but I can do it. Padre, I will go back there and
wash out gold for you to send to the Bishop of Cartagena, that
you may stay here and protect and teach the little Carmen.
Perhaps in time I can wash enough to get you both out of the
country; but it will take many months, it may be, years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, you, whose path in life winds among pleasant places,
where roses nod in the scented breeze and fountains play, picture
to yourself, if you may, the self-immolation of this sweet-souled
man, who, in the winter of life, the shadows of eternity
fast gathering about him, bends his black shoulders again to
the burden which Love would lay upon them. Aye, Love, into
which all else merged&ndash;&ndash;Love for the unknown babe, left helpless
and alone on the great river&rsquo;s bank&ndash;&ndash;Love for the radiant
child, whose white soul the agents of carnal greed and lust
would prostitute to their iniquitous system.</p>
<p>Night fell. By the light of their single candle the priest and
Rosendo ate their simple fare in silence. Carmen was asleep,
and the angels watched over her lowly bed.</p>
<p>The meal ended, Rosendo took up the candle, and Jos&egrave;
followed him into the bedroom. Reverently the two men approached
the sleeping child and looked down upon her. The
priest&rsquo;s hand again sought Rosendo&rsquo;s in a grasp which sealed
anew the pact between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>
</div>
<p>Like the great Exemplar in the days of his preparation, Jos&egrave;
was early driven by the spirit into the wilderness,
where temptation smote him sore. But his soul had been
saved&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;yet so as by fire.&rdquo; Slowly old beliefs and faiths crumbled
into dust, while the new remained still unrevealed. The
drift toward atheism which had set in during his long incarceration
in the convent of Palazzola had not made him yield to
the temptation to raise the mask of hypocrisy and plunge into
the pleasures of the world, nor accept the specious proffer of
ecclesiastical preferment in exchange for his honest convictions.
Honor, however bigoted the sense, bound him to his oath, or at
least to a compromising observance of it harmless to the
Church. Pride contributed to hold him from the degradation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page55' name='book2_page55'></a>55</span>
of a renegade and apostate priest. And both rested primarily
on an unshaken basis of maternal affection, which fell little
short of obsession, leaving him without the strength to say,
&ldquo;Woman, what have I to do with thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, though atheism in belief leads almost inevitably to disintegration
of morals, Jos&egrave; had kept himself untainted. For
his vital problems he had now, after many days, found &ldquo;grace
sufficient.&rdquo; In what he had regarded as the contemptible tricks
of fate, he was beginning to discern the guiding hand of a wisdom
greater than the world&rsquo;s. The danger threatened by Cartagena
was, temporarily, at least, averted by Rosendo&rsquo;s magnificent
spirit. Under the spur of that sacrifice his own courage
rose mightily to second it.</p>
<p>Rosendo spent the day in preparation for his journey into
the Guamoc&oacute; country. He had discussed with Jos&egrave;, long and
earnestly, its probable effect upon the people of Simit&iacute;, and
especially upon Don Mario, the Alcalde; but it was decided that
no further explanation should be made than that he was again
going to prospect in the mineral districts already so familiar to
him. As Rosendo had said, this venture, together with the unannounced
and unsolicited presence of the priest in the town,
could not but excite extreme curiosity and raise the most lively
conjectures, which might, in time, reach Wenceslas. On the
other hand, if success attended his efforts, it was more than
probable that Cartagena would remain quiet, as long as her
itching palm was brightened with the yellow metal which he
hoped to wrest from the sands of Guamoc&oacute;. &ldquo;It is only a
chance, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo said dubiously. &ldquo;In the days of the
Spaniards the river sands of Guamoc&oacute; produced from two to
ten <i>reales</i> a day to each slave. But the rivers have been almost
washed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; made a quick mental calculation. A Spanish <i>real</i> was
equivalent to half a franc. Then ten <i>reales</i> would amount to
five francs, the very best he could hope for as a day&rsquo;s yield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my supplies and the support of the se&ntilde;ora and Carmen
must come out of that,&rdquo; Rosendo added. &ldquo;Besides, I must pay
Juan for working the <i>hacienda</i> across the lake for me while I
am away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly ten <i>pesos oro</i>, or forty francs, might remain at the
end of each month for them to send to Cartagena. Jos&egrave; sighed
heavily as he busied himself with the preparations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got these supplies from Don Mario on credit, Padre,&rdquo; explained
Rosendo. &ldquo;I thought best to buy from him to prevent
making him angry. I have coffee, <i>panela</i>, rice, beans, and tobacco
for a month. He was very willing to let me have them&ndash;&ndash;but
do you know why? He wants me to go up there and fail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page56' name='book2_page56'></a>56</span>
Then he will have me in his debt, and I become his <i>peon</i>&ndash;&ndash;and I
would never be anything after that but his slave, for never
again would he let me get out of debt to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; shuddered at the thought of the awful system of peonage
prevalent in these Latin countries, an inhuman custom only
a degree removed from the slavery of colonial times. This
venture was, without doubt, a desperate risk. But it was for
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;and its expediency could not be questioned.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; penned a letter to the Bishop of Cartagena that morning,
and sent it by Juan to Bodega Central to await the next
down-river steamer. He did not know that Juan carried another
letter for the Bishop, and addressed in the flowing hand
of the Alcalde. Jos&egrave; briefly acknowledged the Bishop&rsquo;s communication,
and replied that he would labor unflaggingly to
uplift his people and further their spiritual development. As
to the Bishop&rsquo;s instructions, he would endeavor to make Simit&iacute;&rsquo;s
contribution to the support of Holy Church, both material and
spiritual, fully commensurate with the population. He did not
touch on the other instructions, but closed with fervent assurances
of his intention to serve his little flock with an undivided
heart. Carmen received no lesson that day, and her rapidly
flowing questions anent the unusual activity in the household
were met with the single explanation that her padre Rosendo
had found it necessary to go up to the Tigu&iacute; river, a journey
which some day she might perhaps take with him.</p>
<p>During the afternoon Jos&egrave; wrote two more letters, one to
his uncle, briefly announcing his appointment to the parish of
Simit&iacute;, and his already lively interest in his new field; the other
to his beloved mother, in which he only hinted at the new-found
hope which served as his pillow at night. He did not
mention Carmen, for fear that his letter might be opened ere it
left Cartagena. But in tenderest expressions of affection, and
regret that he had been the unwitting cause of his mother&rsquo;s sorrow,
he begged her to believe that his life had received a stimulus
which could not but result in great happiness for them
both, for he was convinced that he had at last found his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>,
even though among a lowly people and in a sequestered part of
the world. He hoped again to be reunited to her&ndash;&ndash;possibly she
might some day meet him in Cartagena. And until then he
would always hold her in tenderest love and the brightest and
purest thought.</p>
<p>He brushed aside the tears as he folded this letter; and,
lest regret and self-condemnation seize him again, hurried
forth in search of Carmen, whose radiance always dispelled his
gloom as the rushing dawn shatters the night.</p>
<p>She was not in Rosendo&rsquo;s house, and Do&ntilde;a Maria said she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page57' name='book2_page57'></a>57</span>
had seen the child some time before going in the direction of
the &ldquo;shales.&rdquo; These were broad beds of rock to the south of
town, much broken and deeply fissured, and so glaringly hot
during most of the day as to be impassable. Thither Jos&egrave; bent
his steps, and at length came upon the girl sitting in the shade
of a stunted <i>algarroba</i> tree some distance from the usual trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you doing here, little one?&rdquo; he inquired
in surprise.</p>
<p>The child looked up visibly embarrassed. &ldquo;I was thinking,
Padre,&rdquo; she made slow reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you have to go away from home to think?&rdquo; he
queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to be alone; and there was so much going on in
the house that I came out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been thinking about, Carmen?&rdquo; pursued
Jos&egrave;, suspecting that her presence in the hot shale beds held
some deeper significance than she had as yet revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I was just thinking that God is everywhere,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>. And&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That He is where padre Rosendo is going, and that He will
take care of him up there, and bring him back to Simit&iacute; again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you asking Him to do it, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre; I was just <i>knowing</i> that He would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little lip quivered, and the brown eyes were wet with
tears. But Jos&egrave; could see that faith had conquered, whatever
the struggle might have been. The child evidently had sought
solitude, that she might most forcibly bring her trust in God
to bear upon the little problem confronting her&ndash;&ndash;that she might
make the certainty of His immanence and goodness destroy in
her thought every dark suggestion of fear or doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will take care of him, won&rsquo;t He, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had taken her hand and was leading her back to the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said it, child; and I believe you are a law unto
yourself,&rdquo; was the priest&rsquo;s low, earnest reply. The child smiled
up at him; and Jos&egrave; knew he had spoken truth.</p>
<p>That evening, the preparations for departure completed,
Rosendo and Jos&egrave; took their chairs out before the house, where
they sat late, each loath to separate lest some final word be left
unsaid. The tepid evening melted into night, which died away
in a deep silence that hung wraith-like over the old town.
Myriad stars rained their shimmering lustre out of the unfathomable
vault above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Un canasto de flores</i>,&rdquo; mused Rosendo, looking off into the
infinite blue.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page58' name='book2_page58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A basket of flowers, indeed,&rdquo; responded Jos&egrave; reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Rosendo&rsquo;s brain seemed to struggle with a tremendous
thought&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I often try to think of what is beyond the
stars; and I cannot. Where is the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is none, Rosendo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if we could get out to the last star&ndash;&ndash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still no end, no limit,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are very far away&ndash;&ndash;how far, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not comprehend, even if I could tell you, Rosendo.
But&ndash;&ndash;how shall I say it? Some are millions of miles
from us. Others so far that their light reaches us only after
the lapse of centuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their light!&rdquo; returned Rosendo quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Light from those stars above us travels nearly two
hundred thousand miles a second&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated the uncomprehending Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, even at that awful rate of speed, it is probable
that there are many stars whose light has not yet reached the
earth since it became inhabited by men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well say so, friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre&ndash;&ndash;does the light never stop? When does it
reach an end&ndash;&ndash;a stopping-place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no stopping-place, Rosendo. There is no solid
sky above us. Go whichever way you will, you can never reach
an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s brow knotted with puzzled wonder: Even Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
own mind staggered anew at its concept of the immeasurable
depths of space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, if we could go far enough up we would get to
heaven, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; pursued Rosendo. &ldquo;And if we went far
enough down we would reach purgatory, and then hell, is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Restraint fell upon the priest. He dared not answer lest he
reveal his own paucity of ideas regarding these things. Happily
the loquacious Rosendo continued without waiting for reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Sim&oacute;n used to say when I was a child that the red
we saw in the sky at sunset was the reflection of the flames of
hell; so I have always thought that hell was below us&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
in the center of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time his simple mind mused over this puerile idea.
Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose God looks like, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thought flew back to the galleries and chapels of
Europe, where the masters have so often portrayed their ideas
of God in the shape of an old, gray-haired man, partly bald,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page59' name='book2_page59'></a>59</span>
and with long, flowing beard. Alas! how pitifully crude, how
lamentably impotent such childish concepts. For they saw in
God only their own frailties infinitely magnified. Small wonder
that they lived and died in spiritual gloom!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo went on, &ldquo;if there is no limit to the universe,
then it is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infinite in extent, Rosendo,&rdquo; finished Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then whoever made it is infinite, too,&rdquo; Rosendo added
hypothetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An infinite effect implies an infinite cause&ndash;&ndash;yes, certainly,&rdquo;
Jos&egrave; answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if God made the universe, He is infinite, is He not,
Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then He can&rsquo;t be at all like us,&rdquo; was the logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was thinking hard. The universe stands as something
created. And scientists agree that it is infinite in extent. Its
creator therefore must be infinite in extent. And as the universe
continues to exist, that which called it into being, and
still maintains it, must likewise continue to exist. Hence, God <i>is</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, what holds the stars in place?&rdquo; Rosendo&rsquo;s questions
were as persistent as a child&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are held in place by laws, Rosendo,&rdquo; the priest replied
evasively. But as he made answer he revolved in his
own mind that the laws by which an infinite universe is
created and maintained must themselves be infinite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God made those laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosendo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, the priest mused, a power great enough to frame infinite
laws must be itself all-powerful. And if it has ever been
all-powerful, it could never cease to be so, for there could be
nothing to deprive it of its power. Omnipotence excludes
everything else. Or, what is the same thing, is all-inclusive.</p>
<p>But laws originate, even as among human beings, in mind,
for a law is a mental thing. So the infinite laws which
bind the stars together, and by which the universe was designed
and is still maintained, could have originated only in a
mind, and that one infinite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then God surely must know everything,&rdquo; commented
Rosendo, by way of simple and satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>Certainly the creator of an infinite universe&ndash;&ndash;a universe,
moreover, which reveals intelligence and knowledge on the
part of its cause&ndash;&ndash;the originator of infinite laws, which reveal
omnipotence in their maker&ndash;&ndash;must have all knowledge, all
wisdom, at his command. But, on the other hand, intelligence,
knowledge, wisdom, are ever mental things. What could embrace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page60' name='book2_page60'></a>60</span>
these things, and by them create an infinite universe, but
an infinite <i>mind</i>?</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thought reverted to Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s reference to
God as &ldquo;an initial principle.&rdquo; Surely the history of the universe
reveals the patent fact that, despite the mutations of time, despite
growth, maturity, and decay, despite &ldquo;the wreck of matter
and the crash of worlds,&rdquo; <i>something</i> endures. What is it&ndash;&ndash;law?
Yes, but more. Ideas? Still more. Mind? Yes, the
mind which is the <i>anima mundi</i>, the principle, of all things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if He is so great, Padre, and knows everything, I don&rsquo;t
see why He made the devil,&rdquo; continued Rosendo; &ldquo;for the devil
fights against Him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, simple-hearted child of nature! A mind so pure as
yours should give no heed to thoughts of Satan. And the man at
your side is now too deeply buried in the channels which run below
the superficiality of the world&rsquo;s thought to hear your
childish question. Wait. The cause of an infinite effect must
itself be infinite. The framer of infinite laws must be an infinite
mind. And an infinite mind must contain all knowledge,
and have all power. But were it to contain any seeds or germs
of decay, or any elements of discord&ndash;&ndash;in a word, any evil&ndash;&ndash;it
must disintegrate. Then it would cease to be omnipotent.
Verily, to be eternal and perfect <i>it must be wholly good</i>! &ldquo;And
so,&rdquo; the priest mused aloud, &ldquo;we call it God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, he continued to reflect, when we accept the conclusion
that the universe is the product of an infinite mind, we are
driven to certain other inevitable conclusions, if we would be
logical. The minds of men manifest themselves continually,
and the manifestation is in mental processes and things. Mental
activity results in the unfolding of ideas. Does the activity
of an infinite mind differ in this respect? And, if not, can the
universe be other than a mental thing? For, if an infinite mind
created a universe, it must have done so <i>by the unfolding of
its own ideas</i>! And, remaining infinite, filling all space, this
mind must ever continue to contain those ideas. And the universe&ndash;&ndash;the
creation&ndash;&ndash;is mental.</p>
<p>The burden of thought oppressed the priest, and he got up
from his chair and paced back and forth before the house.
But still his searching mind burrowed incessantly, as if it
would unearth a living thing that had been buried since the
beginning.</p>
<p>In order to fully express itself, an infinite mind would have
to unfold an infinite number and variety of ideas. And this
unfolding would go on forever, since an infinite number is never
reached. This is &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; and it could never terminate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, returning to his chair, &ldquo;you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page61' name='book2_page61'></a>61</span>
asked what God looks like. I cannot say, for God must be
mind, unlimited mind. He has all knowledge and wisdom, as
well as all power. He is necessarily eternal&ndash;&ndash;has always existed,
and always will, for He is entirely perfect and harmonious,
without the slightest trace or taint of discord or evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think He does not look like us?&rdquo; queried the
simple Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind does not look like a human body, Rosendo. And an
infinite cause can be infinite only by being mind, not body.
Moreover, He is unchanging&ndash;&ndash;for He could not change and remain
eternal. Carmen insists that He is everywhere. To be
always present He must be what the Bible says He is spirit.
Or, what is the same thing, mind. Rosendo, He manifests
Himself everywhere and in everything&ndash;&ndash;there is no other conclusion
admissible. And to be eternal He has got to be <i>absolutely
good</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo; persisted Rosendo, &ldquo;who made the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is wickedness&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave; emphatically. &ldquo;God is infinite good,
and there can be no real evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know that, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say how I know it&ndash;&ndash;it reasons out that way logically.
I think I begin to see the light. Can you not see that for
some reason Carmen doesn&rsquo;t admit the existence of evil? And
you know, and I know, that she is on the right track. I have
followed the opposite path all my life; and it led right into the
slough of despond. Now I have turned, and am trying to follow
her. And do you put the thought of Satan out of your
mentality and do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, the Virgin Mary&ndash;&ndash;she has power with God?&rdquo; Rosendo&rsquo;s
primitive ideas were in a hopeless tangle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good friend, forget the Virgin Mary,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; gently,
laying his hand on Rosendo&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget her! <i>Hombre!</i> Why&ndash;&ndash;she has all power&ndash;&ndash;she
works miracles every hour&ndash;&ndash;she directs the angels&ndash;&ndash;gives commands
to God himself! Padre Sim&oacute;n said she was the absolute
mistress of heaven and earth, and that men and animals, the
plants, the winds, all health, sickness, life and death, depended
upon her will! He said she did not die as we must, but that
she was taken up into heaven, and that her body was not allowed
to decay and return to dust, as ours will. <i>Hombre!</i> She
is in heaven now, praying for us. What would become of us
but for her?&ndash;&ndash;for she prays to God for us&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rosendo, she does nothing of the kind. God is infinite,
unchanging. He could not be moved or influenced by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page62' name='book2_page62'></a>62</span>
the Virgin Mary or any one else. He is unlimited <i>good</i>. He is
not angry with us&ndash;&ndash;He couldn&rsquo;t be, for He could not know
anger. Did not Jesus say that God was Love? Love does not
afflict&ndash;&ndash;Love does not need to be importuned or prayed to. I see
it now. I see something of what Carmen sees. We suffer when
we sin, because we &lsquo;miss the mark.&rsquo; But the punishment lasts
only as long as the sin continues. And we suffer only until
we know that God is infinite good, and that there is no evil.
That is the truth, I feel sure, which Jesus came to teach, and
which he said would make us free. Free from what? From
the awful beliefs that use us, and to which we are now subject,
until we learn the facts about God and His creation. Don&rsquo;t
you see that infinite good could never create evil, nor ever permit
evil to be created, nor allow it to really exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what is evil? And where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we must wait to learn, Rosendo, little by little. You
know, the Spanish proverb says, &lsquo;Step by step goes a great
way.&rsquo; But meantime, let us go forward, clinging to this great
truth: God is infinite good&ndash;&ndash;He is love&ndash;&ndash;we are His dear children&ndash;&ndash;and
evil was <i>not</i> made by Him, and does not have His
sanction. It therefore cannot be real. It must be illusion.
And, being such, it can be overcome, as Jesus said it could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Rosendo!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; held up his hand. &ldquo;Carmen is doing
just what I am advising you to do&ndash;&ndash;is she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she is mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, she knows God better than she knows me,&rdquo; the
man whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you who first told her that God was everywhere,
was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the mind of the child, keenly sensitive and receptive
to truth, had eagerly grasped this dictum and made it the motif
of her life. She knew nothing of Jesus, nothing of current
theology. Divine Wisdom had used Rosendo, credulous and
superstitious though he himself was, to guard this girl&rsquo;s mind
against the entrance of errors which were taught him as a
child, and which in manhood held him shackled in chains which
he might not break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; spoke low and reverently, &ldquo;I believe now
that you and I have both been guided by that great mind which
I am calling God. I believe we are being used for some beneficent
purpose, and that it has to do with Carmen. That purpose
will be unfolded to us as we bow to His will. Every way
closed against me, excepting the one that led to Simit&iacute;. Here I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page63' name='book2_page63'></a>63</span>
found her. And now there seems to be but one way open to
you&ndash;&ndash;to go back to Guamoc&oacute;. And you go, forgetful of self,
thinking only that you serve her. Ah, friend, you are serving
Him whom you reflect in love to His beautiful child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, while we accept our tasks gratefully, I feel that we
shall be tried&ndash;&ndash;and we may not live to see the results of our
labors. There are influences abroad which threaten danger to
Carmen and to us. Perhaps we shall not avert them. But we
have given ourselves to her, and through her to the great purpose
with which I feel she is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo slowly rose, and his great height and magnificent
physique cast the shadow of a Brobdignan in the light as he
stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am an old man, and I have but few
years left. But however many they be, they are hers. And
had I a thousand, I would drag them all through the fires of
hell for the child! I cannot follow you when you talk about
God. My mind gets weary. But this I know, the One who
brought me here and then went away will some day call for me&ndash;&ndash;and
I am always ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned into the house and sought his hard bed. The
great soul knew not that he reflected the light of divine Love
with a radiance unknown to many a boasting &ldquo;vicar of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>
</div>
<p>At the first faint flush of morn Rosendo departed for the
hills. The emerald coronels of the giant <i>ceibas</i> on the far
lake verge burned softly with a ruddy glow. From the
water&rsquo;s dimpling surface downy vapors rose languidly in delicate
tints and drew slowly out in nebulous bands across the
dawn sky. The smiling softness of the velvety hills beckoned
him, and the pungent odor of moist earth dilated his nostrils.
He laughed aloud as the joyousness of youth surged again
through his veins. The village still slumbered, and no one saw
him as he smote his great chest and strode to the boat, where
Juan had disposed his outfit and was waiting to pole him across.
Only the faithful Do&ntilde;a Maria had softly called a final &ldquo;<i>adioscito</i>&rdquo;
to him when he left his house. A half hour later, when
the dugout poked its blunt nose into the ooze of the opposite
shore, he leaped out and hurriedly divested himself of his
clothing. Then he lifted his chair with its supplies to his
shoulders, and Juan strapped it securely to his back, drawing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page64' name='book2_page64'></a>64</span>
the heavy band tightly across his forehead. With a farewell
wave of his hand to the lad, the man turned and plunged into
the Guamoc&oacute; trail, and was quickly lost in the dense thicket.
Six days later, if no accident befell, he would reach his destination,
the singing waters of the crystal Tigu&iacute;.</p>
<p>His heart leaped as he strode, though none knew better
than he what hardships those six days held for him&ndash;&ndash;days of
plunging through fever-laden bogs; staggering in withering
heat across open savannas; now scaling the slippery slopes of
great mountains; now swimming the chill waters of rushing
streams; making his bed where night overtook him, among
the softly pattering forest denizens and the swarming insect
life of the dripping woods. His black skin glistened with perspiration
and the heavy dew wiped from the close-growing
bush. With one hand he leaned upon a young sapling cut for
a staff. With the other he incessantly swung his <i>machete</i> to
clear the dim trail. His eyes were held fixed to the ground,
to escape tripping over low vines, and to avoid contact with
crawling creatures of the jungle, whose sting, inflicted without
provocation, might so easily prove fatal. His active mind
sported the while among the fresh thoughts stimulated by. his
journey, though back of all, as through a veil, the vision of
Carmen rose like the pillar of cloud which guided the wandering
Israel. Toil and danger fled its presence; and from it
radiated a warm glow which suffused his soul with light.</p>
<p>When Jos&egrave; arose that morning he was still puzzling over
the logical conclusions drawn from his premise of the evening
before, and trying to reconcile them with common sense and
prevalent belief. In a way, he seemed to be an explorer, carving
a path to hidden wonders. Do&ntilde;a Maria greeted him at the
breakfast table with the simple announcement of Rosendo&rsquo;s
early departure. No sign of sorrow ruffled her quiet and
dignified demeanor. Nor did Carmen, who bounded into his
arms, fresh as a new-blown rose, manifest the slightest indication
of anxiety regarding Rosendo&rsquo;s welfare. Jos&egrave; might
not divine the thoughts which the woman&rsquo;s placid exterior
concealed. But for the child, he well knew that her problem
had been met and solved, and that she had laid it aside with
a trust in immanent good which he did not believe all the
worldly argument of pedant or philosopher could shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to business once more!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; joyously, the meal
finished. &ldquo;Just a look-in at the church, to get the boys started;
and then to devote the day to you, se&ntilde;orita!&rdquo; The child
laughed at the appellation.</p>
<p>Returning from the church some moments later, Jos&egrave;
found Carmen bending over the fireplace, struggling to remove
a heavy kettle from the hot stones.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page65' name='book2_page65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, child!&rdquo; he cried in apprehension, hurrying to her
assistance. &ldquo;You will burn your fingers, or hurt yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you make me, Padre,&rdquo; Carmen quickly replied,
rising and confronting the priest with a demeanor whose every
element spelled rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly shall not <i>make</i> you!&rdquo; the man exclaimed
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre. God will not let you. He does not burn or
hurt people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing else can, for He is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;perhaps so,&rdquo; the priest retorted impatiently. &ldquo;But
somehow people get burnt and hurt just the same, and it is
well to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child studied him for a moment. Then she said
quietly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess people burn and hurt themselves because they are
afraid&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t they? And I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tossed her brown curls as if in defiance of the thought
of fear. Yet Jos&egrave; somehow felt that she never really defied
evil, but rather met its suggestions with a firm conviction of
its impotence in the presence of immanent good. He checked
the impulse to further conversation. Bidding the child come
to him as soon as possible to begin the day&rsquo;s work, he went
back to his own abode to reflect.</p>
<p>He had previously said that this child should be brought
up to know no evil. And yet, was he not suggesting evil to
her at every turn? Did not his insistence upon the likelihood
of hurting or burning herself emphasize his own stalwart
belief in evil as an immanent power and contingency? Was
he thus always to maintain a house divided against itself? But
some day she <i>must</i> know, whether by instruction or dire experience,
that evil is a fact to be reckoned with! And as her
protector, it was his duty to&ndash;&ndash;But he had not the heart to
shatter such beautiful confidence!</p>
<p>Then he fell to wondering how long that pure faith could
endure. Certainly not long if she were subjected to the sort of
instruction which the children of this world receive. But was
it not his duty with proper tutelage to make it last as long as
possible? Was it not even now so firmly grounded that it
never could be shaken?</p>
<p>He dwelt on the fact that nearly all children at some period
early in life commune with their concept of God. He had,
himself. As a very young child he had even felt himself on
such terms of familiarity with God that he could not sleep
without first bidding Him good night. As a young child, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page66' name='book2_page66'></a>66</span>
he had known no evil. Nor do any children, until their perfect
confidence in good is chilled by the false instruction of parents
and teachers, who parade evil before them in all its hideous
garb.</p>
<p>Alas! for the baneful belief that years bring wisdom. How
pitiable, and how cruelly detrimental to the child are an ignorant
parent&rsquo;s assumptions of superiority! How tremendous
the responsibility that now lay at his own door! Yet no
greater than that which lies at the door of every parent
throughout the world.</p>
<p>It is sadly true, he reflected, that children are educated
almost entirely along material lines. Even in the imparting of
religious instruction, the spiritual is so tainted with materialism,
and its concomitants of fear and limitation, that the preponderance
of faith is always on the material side. Jos&egrave; had
believed that as he had grown older in years he had lost faith.
Far from it! The quantity of his faith remained fixed; but
the quality had changed, through education, from faith in
good to faith in evil. And though trained as a priest of God,
in reality he had been taught wholly to distrust spiritual power.</p>
<p>But how could a parent rely on spiritual power to save a
child about to fall into the fire? Must not children be warned,
and taught to protect themselves from accident and disaster,
as far as may be? True&ndash;&ndash;yet, what causes accident and disaster?
Has the parent&rsquo;s thought aught to do with it? Has
the world&rsquo;s thought? Can it be traced to the universal acceptance
of evil as a power, real and operative? Does mankind&rsquo;s
woeful lack of faith in good manifest itself in accident, sickness,
and death?</p>
<p>A cry roused Jos&egrave; from his revery. It came from back of
the house. Hastening to the rear door he saw Do&ntilde;a Maria
standing petrified, looking in wide-eyed horror toward the
lake. Jos&egrave; followed her gaze, and his blood froze. Carmen
had been sent to meet the canoe that daily supplied fresh water
to the village from the Juncal river, which flowed into the
lake at the far north end. It had not yet arrived, and she had
sat down beside her jar at the water&rsquo;s edge, and was lost in
dreams as she looked out over the shimmering expanse. A
huge crocodile which had been lying in the shadow of a shale
ledge had marked the child, and was steadily creeping up behind
her. The reptile was but a few feet from her when Do&ntilde;a
Maria, wondering at her delay, had gone to the rear door and
witnessed her peril.</p>
<p>In a flash Jos&egrave; recalled the tale related to him but a few
days before by Fidel Avila, who was working in the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; Fidel had said, &ldquo;as soon as the church is ready I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page67' name='book2_page67'></a>67</span>
shall offer a candle to good <i>Santa Catalina</i> for protecting my
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that, my son?&rdquo; inquired Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She protected her from a crocodile a year ago, Padre. The
girl had gone to the lake to get water to wash our clothes, and
as she sat in the stern of the boat dipping the water, a great
crocodile rose and seized her arm. I heard her scream, and
I was saying the rosary at the time. And so I prayed to <i>Santa
Catalina</i> not to let the crocodile eat her, and she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your sister was saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crocodile pulled her under the water, Padre, and she
was drowned. But he did not eat her; and we got her body
and buried her here in the cemetery. We were very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Sancta simplicitas!</i> That such childish credulity might be
turned into proper channels!</p>
<p>But there were times when fish were scarce in the lake.
Then the crocodiles became bold; and many babes had been
seized and dragged off by them, never to return. The fishing
this season had been very poor. And more than one fisherman
had asked Jos&egrave; to invoke the Virgin in his behalf.</p>
<p>Nearer crept the monster toward the unsuspecting girl.
Suddenly she turned and looked squarely at it. She might
almost have touched it with her hand. For Jos&egrave; it was one of
those crises that &ldquo;crowd eternity into an hour.&rdquo; The child
and the reptile might have been painted against that wondrous
tropic background. The great brute stood bolt upright on its
squat legs, its hideous jaws partly open. The girl made no
motion, but seemed to hold it with her steady gaze. Then&ndash;&ndash;the
creature dropped; its jaws snapped shut; and it scampered
into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, as he rushed to the girl and clasped
her in his arms. &ldquo;Forgive me if I ever doubted the miracles
of Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria turned and quietly resumed her work; but the
man was completely unstrung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Padre?&rdquo; Carmen asked in unfeigned surprise.
&ldquo;I am not afraid of crocodiles&ndash;&ndash;are you? You couldn&rsquo;t be, if
you knew that God is everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know, child, that crocodiles have carried
off&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He checked himself. No&ndash;&ndash;he would not say it. He had
had his lesson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing&ndash;&ndash;I forgot&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s all. A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;come, let
us begin our lessons now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his mind refused to be held to the work. Finally he
had to ask&ndash;&ndash;he could not help it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page68' name='book2_page68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen, what did you do? Did you talk to the crocodile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Padre&ndash;&ndash;crocodiles don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; And throwing
her little head back she laughed heartily at the absurd idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you did something! What was it? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre, I did nothing,&rdquo; the child persisted.</p>
<p>He saw he must reach her thought in another way. &ldquo;Why
did the crocodile come up to you, Carmen?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I guess because it loved me&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you love it as you sat looking at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Padre. We have just got to love <i>everything</i>.
Don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;that is so, <i>chiquita</i>. I&ndash;&ndash;I just thought I would ask
you. Now let us begin the arithmetic lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child loved the hideous saurian! And &ldquo;perfect love
casteth out fear.&rdquo; What turned the monster from the girl
and drove it into the lake? Love, again, before which evil falls
in sheer impotence? Had she worked a miracle? Certainly
not! Had God interposed in her behalf? Again, no. &ldquo;He that
dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty.&rdquo; And would divine Love always
protect her? There could be no question about it, <i>as long as
she knew no evil</i>.</p>
<p>The morning hours sped past. From arithmetic, they
turned to the English lesson. Next to perfection in her own
Castilian, Jos&egrave; felt that this language was most important for
her. And she delighted in it, although her odd little pronunciations,
and her vain attempts to manipulate words to conform to
her own ideas of enunciation brought many a hearty laugh, in
which she joined with enthusiasm. The afternoon, as was
his plan for future work, was devoted to narratives of men
and events, and to descriptions of places. It was a ceaseless
wonder to Jos&egrave; how her mind absorbed his instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How readily you see these things, Carmen,&rdquo; he said, as
he concluded the work for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See them, Padre? But not with my outside eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark seemed to start a train of thought within her
mentality. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she at length asked, &ldquo;how do we see with
our eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very simple, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied. &ldquo;Here, let me
draw a picture of an eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quickly sketched a rough outline of the human organ of
sight. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you know you cannot see in the
dark, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to see, we must have light.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page69' name='book2_page69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What is light, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;light is&ndash;&ndash;is vibrations. That is, rapid movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What moves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;well, nothing&ndash;&ndash;that is, light is just vibrations.
The pendulum of the old clock in Don Mario&rsquo;s store vibrates,
you know&ndash;&ndash;moves back and forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And light does that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; light <i>is</i> that. Now that chair there, for example,
reflects light, just as a mirror does. It reflects vibrations. And
these are all of just a certain length, for vibrations of just
that length and moving up and down just so fast make light.
The light enters the eye, like this,&rdquo; tracing the rays on his
sketch. &ldquo;It makes a little picture of the chair on the back of
the eye, where the optic nerve is fastened. Now the light
makes the little ends of this nerve vibrate, too&ndash;&ndash;move very
rapidly. And that movement is carried along the nerve to
some place in the brain&ndash;&ndash;to what we call the center of sight.
And there we see the chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child studied the sketch long and seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, is the picture of the chair carried on the nerve
to the brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, <i>chiquita</i>, only vibrations. It is as if the nerve
moved just a little distance, but very, very fast, back and
forth, or up and down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no picture is carried to the brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is just a vibration in the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that vibration makes us see the chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of silence. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>chiquita</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre, what is it that sees the chair, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mind, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the mind up there in the brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;no, we can&rsquo;t say that it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;well, no place in particular&ndash;&ndash;that is, it is right
here all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, when the mind wants to see the chair does it
have to climb up into the brain and watch that little nerve
wiggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was at a loss for an answer. Carmen suddenly
crumpled the sketch in her small hand and smiled up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, I don&rsquo;t believe our outside eyes see anything.
We just think they do, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked out through the open door. Carmen&rsquo;s weird
heron was stalking in immense dignity past the house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page70' name='book2_page70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think Cantar-las-horas is getting ready to sing the Vespers,
<i>chiquita</i>. And so Do&ntilde;a Maria probably needs you now.
We will talk more about the eye to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the light of his sputtering candle that night Jos&egrave; sat
with elbows propped on the table, his head clasped in his
hands, and a sketch of the human eye before him. In his confident
attempt to explain to Carmen the process of cognition he
had been completely baffled. Certainly, light coming from an
object enters the eye and casts a picture upon the retina. He
had often seen the photographic camera exhibit the same
phenomenon. The law of the impenetrability of matter had
to be set aside, of course&ndash;&ndash;or else light must be pure vibration,
without a material vibrating concomitant. Then, too, it was
plain that the light in some way communicated its vibration
to the little projecting ends of the optic nerve, which lie spread
out over the rear inner surface of the eye. And equally patent
that this vibration is in some way taken up by the optic nerve
and transmitted to the center of sight in the brain. But after
that&ndash;&ndash;what? He laughed again at Carmen&rsquo;s pertinent question
about the mind climbing up into the brain to see the
vibrating nerve. But was it so silly a presumption, after all?
Is the mind within the brain, awaiting in Stygian darkness the
advent of the vibrations which shall give it pictures of the outside
world? Or is the mind outside of the brain, but still
slavishly forced to look at these vibrations of the optic nerve
and then translate them into terms of things without? What
could a vibrating nerve suggest to a well-ordered mind, anyway?
He might as logically wave a piece of meat and expect
thereby to see a world! He laughed aloud at the thought.
Why does not the foolish mind leave the brain and look at
the picture on the retina? Or why does it not throw off its
shackles and look directly at the object to be cognized, instead
of submitting to dependence upon so frail a thing as fleshly
eyes and nerves?</p>
<p>As he mused and sketched, unmindful of the voracious
mosquitoes or the blundering moths that momentarily threatened
his light, it dawned slowly upon him that the mind&rsquo;s
awareness of material objects could not possibly depend upon
the vibrations of pieces of nerve tissue, so minute as to be
almost invisible to the unaided sight. Still more absurd did
it appear to him that his own mind, of which he might justly
boast tremendous powers, could be prostituted to such a degree
that its knowledge of things must be served to it on
waving pieces of flesh.</p>
<p>And how about the other senses&ndash;&ndash;touch, hearing? Did
the ear hear, or the hand feel? He had always accepted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page71' name='book2_page71'></a>71</span>
general belief that man is dependent absolutely upon the five
physical senses for his knowledge of an outside world. And
now a little thought showed that from these five senses man
could not possibly receive anything more than a series of
disconnected vibrations! And, going a step further, anything
that the mind infers from these vibrations is unquestionably
inferred <i>without a particle of outside authority</i>!</p>
<p>He rose and paced the floor. A tremendous idea seemed to
be knocking at the portal of his mentality.</p>
<p>What can the mind know? Assuredly nothing but the contents
of itself. But the contents of mind are thoughts, ideas,
mental things. Do solid material objects enter the mind? Certainly
not! Then the mind knows not things, but its <i>thoughts of
things</i>. And instead of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and
feeling solid material objects, the mind sees, hears, smells,
tastes, and feels&ndash;&ndash;what? The contents of itself! Its own thoughts
and ideas! And the outer world? Is only what the mind
<i>believes</i> it to be. But surely his mind saw an outer world
through the medium of his eye! No. His mind saw only its
own concepts of an outer world&ndash;&ndash;and these concepts, being
mental, might take on whatever hue and tinge his mind decreed.
In other words, instead of seeing a world of matter, he
was seeing only a mental picture of a world. And that picture
was in his own mind, <i>and formed by that mind</i>!</p>
<p>The man seized his hat and hurried out into the night. He
walked rapidly the full length of the town. His mind was
wrestling with stupendous thoughts.</p>
<p>An hour later he returned to his house, and seizing a pencil,
wrote rapidly: Matter is mental. We do not see or feel matter,
but we <i>think</i> it. It is formed and held as a mental concept
in every human mind. The material universe is but the human
mind&rsquo;s concept of a universe, and can only be this mentality&rsquo;s
translation to itself of infinite Mind&rsquo;s purely mental Creation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he commented aloud, sitting back and regarding
his writing, &ldquo;all my miserable life I have been seeing only my
own thoughts! And I have let them use me and color my
whole outlook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extinguished the candle and threw himself, fully
dressed, upon his bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
</div>
<p>Momentous changes, of far-reaching effect, had come
swiftly upon Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n during the last few days,
changes which were destined after much vacillation and
great mental struggle to leave a reversed outlook. But let no
one think these changes fortuitous or casual, the chance result
of a new throw of Fate&rsquo;s dice. Jos&egrave;, seeing them dimly outlined,
did not so regard them, but rather looked upon them as
the working of great mental laws, still unknown, whose cumulative
effect had begun a transformation in his soul. How
often in his seminary days he had pondered the scripture, &ldquo;He
left not Himself without witness.&rdquo; How often he had tried to
see the hopeless confusion of good and evil in the world about
him as a witness to the One who is of purer eyes than to behold
evil. And he had at last abandoned his efforts in despair.
Yet that there must be something behind the complex phenomena
which men call life, he knew. Call it what he would&ndash;&ndash;law,
force, mind, God, or even X, the great unknown quantity
for which life&rsquo;s intricate equations must be solved&ndash;&ndash;yet
<i>something</i> there was in it all which endured in an eternal
manifestation. But could that something endure in an expression
both good and evil?</p>
<p>He had long since abandoned all study of the Bible. But
in these last days there had begun to dawn upon him the conviction
that within that strange book were locked mysteries
which far transcended the wildest imaginings of the human
mind. With it came also the certainty that Jesus had been in
complete possession of those sacred mysteries. There could
be no question now that his mission had been woefully misunderstood,
often deliberately misinterpreted, and too frequently
maliciously misused by mankind. His greatest sayings,
teachings so pregnant with truth that, had they been rightfully
appropriated by men, ere this would have dematerialized the
universe and revealed the spiritual kingdom of God, had been
warped by cunning minds into crude systems of theology and
righteous shams, behind which the world&rsquo;s money-changers
and sellers of doves still drove their wicked traffic and offered
insults to Truth in the temple of the Most High.</p>
<p>Oh, how he now lamented the narrowness and the intellectual
limitations with which his seminary training had been
hedged about! The world&rsquo;s thought had been a closed book
to him. Because of his morbid honesty, only such pages
reached his eye as had passed the bigoted censorship of Holy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page73' name='book2_page73'></a>73</span>
Church. His religious instruction had been served to him
with the seal of infallible authority. Of other systems of
theology he had been permitted only the Vatican&rsquo;s biased interpretation,
for the curse of Holy Church rested upon them.
Of current philosophical thought, of Bible criticism and the
results of independent scriptural research, he knew practically
nothing&ndash;&ndash;little beyond what the explorer had told him in their
memorable talks a few weeks before in Cartagena. But, had he
known it, these had unbarred the portals of his mind to the
reception of the new ideas which, under a most powerful stimulus,
were now flowing so steadily through them. That stimulus
was Carmen.</p>
<p>To meet with a child of tender years who knows no evil
is, after all, a not uncommon thing. For, did we but realize
it, the world abounds in them. They are its glory, its radiance&ndash;&ndash;until
they are taught to heed the hiss of the serpent. Their
pure knowledge of immanent good would endure&ndash;&ndash;ah, who
may say how long?&ndash;&ndash;did not we who measure our wisdom by
years forbid them with the fear-born mandate: &ldquo;Thus far!&rdquo;
What manner of being was he who said, &ldquo;Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not?&rdquo; Oh, ye parents, who
forbid your little ones to come to the Christ by hourly heaping
up before them the limitations of fear and doubt, of faith in
the power and reality of sin and evil, of false instruction, and
withering material beliefs! Would not the Christ pray for
you to-day, &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do&rdquo;?</p>
<p>When Jos&egrave; met Carmen she was holding steadfastly to her
vision&ndash;&ndash;the immanence and allness of God. Each day she
created the morrow; and she knew to a certainty that it would
be happy. Would he, clanking his fetters of worldly beliefs,
be the one to shatter her illusion, if illusion it be? Nay, rather
should he seek to learn of her, if; haply she be in possession
of that jewel for which he had searched a vain lifetime. Already
from the stimulus which his intercourse with the child
had given his mental processes there had come a sudden liberation
of thought. Into his freer mentality the Christ-idea now
flowed.</p>
<p>Mankind complain that they cannot &ldquo;prove&rdquo; God. But
Paul long since declared emphatically that to prove Him the
human mind must be transformed. In the light of the great
ideas which had dawned upon him in the past few days&ndash;&ndash;the
nature of God as mind, unlimited, immanent, eternal, and
good; and the specious character of the five physical senses,
which from the beginning have deluded mankind into the
false belief that through them comes a true knowledge of the
cosmos&ndash;&ndash;Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s mentality was being formed anew.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page74' name='book2_page74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>Hegel, delving for truth in a world of illusion, summed up
a lifetime of patient research in the pregnant statement, &ldquo;The
true knowledge of God begins when we know that things as
they are have no truth in them.&rdquo; The testimony of the five
physical senses constitutes &ldquo;things as they are.&rdquo; But&ndash;&ndash;if Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
reasoning be not illogical&ndash;&ndash;the human mind receives no testimony
from these senses, which, at most, can offer but insensate
and meaningless vibrations in a pulpy mass called the
brain. The true knowledge of God, for which Jos&egrave; had yearned
and striven, begins only when men turn from the mesmeric
deception of the physical senses, and learn that there is something,
knowable and usable, behind them, and of whose existence
they give not the slightest intimation.</p>
<p>It was Saturday. The church edifice was so far put in order
that Jos&egrave; found no reason for not holding service on the morrow.
He therefore announced the fact, and told Carmen that
he must devote the day to preparation. Their lessons must
go over to Monday. Seeking the solitude of his house, Jos&egrave;
returned to his Bible.</p>
<p>He began with Genesis. &ldquo;In the beginning&ndash;&ndash;God.&rdquo; Not, as
in the codes of men, God last, and after every material expedient
has been exhausted&ndash;&ndash;but &ldquo;to begin with.&rdquo; Jos&egrave; could
not deny that for all that exists there is a cause. Nor can the
human mind object to the implication that the cause of an
existing universe must itself continue to exist. Even less can
it deny that the framer of the worlds, bound together in infinite
space by the unbreakable cables of infinite laws, must be
omnipotent. And to retain its omnipotence, that cause must be
perfect&ndash;&ndash;absolutely good&ndash;&ndash;every whit pure, sound, and harmonious;
for evil is demonstrably self-destructive. And, lastly,
what power could operate thus but an infinite intelligence, an
all-inclusive mind?</p>
<p>Now let the human mentality continue its own reasoning,
if so be that it hold fast to fact and employ logical processes.
If &ldquo;like produces like&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and from thistles figs do not grow&ndash;&ndash;that
which mind creates must be mental. And a good cause
can produce only a good effect. So the ancient writer, &ldquo;And
God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was
very good.&rdquo; The inspired scribe&ndash;&ndash;inspired? Yes, mused Jos&egrave;,
for inspiration is but the flow of truth into one&rsquo;s mentality&ndash;&ndash;stopped
not until he had said, &ldquo;So God created man in His
own image&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Wait! He will drive that home.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;in the image of God&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;not in the image of matter, not
in the likeness of evil&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;created He him.&rdquo; But what had now
become of that man?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page75' name='book2_page75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>So Jesus, centuries later, &ldquo;God is spirit,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;That which
is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Or, man&ndash;&ndash;true man&ndash;&ndash;expresses
mind, God, and is His eternal and spiritual likeness and reflection.
But, to make this still clearer to torpid minds, Paul
wrote, &ldquo;For in Him we live, and move, and have our being.&rdquo;
Then he added, &ldquo;To be spiritually minded is life.&rdquo; As if he
would say, True life is the <i>consciousness</i> of spiritual things
only.</p>
<p>Is human life aught but a series of states of consciousness?
And is consciousness aught but mental activity?&ndash;&ndash;for when the
mind&rsquo;s activity ceases, the man dies. But mental activity is
the activity of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the activity of thought,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; aloud, &ldquo;that makes
us believe that fleshly eyes see and ears hear. We see only our
thoughts; and in some way they become externalized as our
environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reasoning faculty went busily on. Thought builds
images, or mental concepts, within the mind. These are the
thought-objects which mankind believe they see as material
things in an outer world. And so the world is within, not
without. Jesus must have known this when he said, &ldquo;The
kingdom of heaven is within you.&rdquo; Did he not know the tremendous
effects of thought when he said, &ldquo;For as a man
thinketh, so is he&rdquo;? In other words, a man builds his own
mental image of himself, and conveys it to the fellow-minds
about him.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; again opened his Bible at random. His eye fell upon
the warning of Jeremiah, &ldquo;Hear, O earth, behold I will bring
evil upon this people, <i>even the fruit of their thoughts</i>!&rdquo; Alas!
he needed no warning to show him now the dire results of his
own past wrong thinking.
Evil is but wrong thinking wrought out in life experience.
And so the chief of sins is the breaking of the very first Commandment,
the belief in other powers than God, the infinite
mind that framed the spiritual universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we simply can&rsquo;t help breaking the Commandment,&rdquo;
cried Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;when we see nothing but evil about us! And yet&ndash;&ndash;we
are seeing only the thoughts in our own minds. True&ndash;&ndash;but
how came they there? And whence? From God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was quite ready to concede a mental basis for everything;
to believe that even sin is but the thought of sin, false
thought regarding God and His Creation. But, if God is all-inclusive
mind, He must be <i>the only thinker</i>. And so all
thought must proceed from Him. All thought, both good and
evil? No, for then were God maintaining a house divided
against itself. And that would mean His ultimate dissolution.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page76' name='book2_page76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>Infinite, omnipotent mind is by very logic <i>compelled</i> to be perfect.
Then the thoughts issuing from that mind must be good.
So it must follow that evil thoughts come from another source.
But if God is infinite, there is no other source, no other cause.
Then there is but the single alternative left&ndash;&ndash;<i>evil thoughts
must be unreal</i>.</p>
<p>What was it that the explorer had said to him in regard to
Spencer&rsquo;s definition of reality? &ldquo;That which endures.&rdquo; But,
for that matter, evil seems to be just as enduring as good, and
to run its course as undeviatingly. After all, what is it that
says there is evil? The five physical senses. But that again
reduces to the thought of evil, for men see only their thoughts.
These so-called senses say that the world is flat&ndash;&ndash;that the sun
circles the earth&ndash;&ndash;that objects diminish in size with distance.
They testify not to truth. Jesus said that evil, or the &ldquo;devil,&rdquo;
was &ldquo;a liar and the father of lies.&rdquo; Then the testimony of the
physical senses to evil&ndash;&ndash;and there is no other testimony to
its existence and power&ndash;&ndash;is a lie. A lie is&ndash;&ndash;what? Nothing.
Reason has had to correct sense-testimony in the field of
astronomy and show that the earth is not flat. Where, indeed,
has reason not had to correct sense-testimony? For Jos&egrave; could
now see that all such testimony was essentially false. &ldquo;Things
as they are have no truth in them.&rdquo; In other words, sense-testimony
is false belief. Again, a lie. And the habitat of a
lie is&ndash;&ndash;nowhere. Did the world by clinging to evil and trying
to make something of it, to classify it and reduce it to definite
rules and terms, thus tend to make it real? Assuredly so. And
as long as the world held evil to be real, could evil be overcome?
Again, no. A reality endures forever.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; arose from his study. He believed he was close to
the discovery of that solid basis of truth on which to stand
while teaching Carmen. At any rate, her faith, which he
could no longer believe to be baseless illusion, would not be
shattered by him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>
</div>
<p>Two weeks after his arrival in Simit&iacute; Jos&egrave; conducted his
first services in the ancient church. After four years of
silence, the rusty bell sent out its raucous call from the
old tower that still morning and announced the revival of
public worship.</p>
<p>As the priest stepped from the sacristy and approached the
altar his heart experienced a sudden sinking. Before him his
little flock bowed reverently and expectantly. Looking out at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page77' name='book2_page77'></a>77</span>
them, a lump rose in his throat. He was their pastor, and
daily his love had grown for these kindly, simple folk. And
now, what would he not have given could he have stretched
forth his hands, as did the Master, to heal them of their ills
and lift them out of the shadows of ignorance! Ah, if he could
have thrown aside the mummery and pagan ceremonialism
which he was there to conduct, and have sat down among them,
as Jesus was wont to do on those still mornings in Galilee!
Instead, he stood before them an apostate vassal of Rome,
hypocritically using the Church to shield and maintain himself
in Simit&iacute; while he reared away from her the child Carmen.</p>
<p>Yet, what could he do? He had heard the call; and he had
answered, &ldquo;Master, here am I.&rdquo; And now he was occupying,
while waiting to be led, step by step, out of his cruelly anomalous
position and into his rightful domain. A traitor to Holy
Church? Nay, he thought he would have been a traitor to all
that was best and holiest within himself had he done otherwise.
In the name of the Church he would serve these humble
people. Serving them, he honored the Master. And honoring
Christ, he could not dishonor the Church.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s conduct of the Mass was perfunctory. Vainly he
strove to hold in thought the symbolism of the service, the
offering of Christ as a propitiation for the world&rsquo;s sins. But
gradually the folly of Milton&rsquo;s extravagant, wild dream, which
the poet clothed in such imperishable beauty, stole over him
and blinded this vision. He saw the Holy Trinity sitting in
solemn council in the courts of heaven. He heard their perplexed
discussion of the ravages of Satan in the terrestrial paradise
below. He heard the Father pronounce His awful curse
upon mankind. And he beheld the Son rise and with celestial
magnanimity offer himself as the sacrificial lamb, whose blood
should wash away the serpent-stain of sin. How inept the
whole drama!</p>
<p>And then he thought of Carmen. He had seen her, as he
looked out over his people, sitting with Do&ntilde;a Maria, arrayed in
a clean white frock, and swinging her plump bare legs beneath
the bench, while wonder and amazement peered out from her
big brown eyes as she followed his every move. What would
such things mean to her, whose God was ever-present good?
What did they mean to the priest himself, who was beginning
to see Him as infinite, divine mind, knowing no evil&ndash;&ndash;the One
whose thoughts are not as ours?</p>
<p>He took up the holy water and sprinkled the assemblage.
&ldquo;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow.&rdquo; But how is the human mind
purged of error? By giving it truth. And does the infinite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page78' name='book2_page78'></a>78</span>
mind purge the thought of men in any other way? His mind
was full as he took up the Missal. &ldquo;<i>Kyrie Eleison</i>, <i>Christe
Eleison</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. With a tug he pulled his mind back to the
work before him. But why was he invoking clemency from
One who knows no evil? Heretofore he had always thought
that God knew evil, that He must recognize it, and that He
strove Himself to overcome it. But if God knew evil, then evil
were real and eternal! Dreamily he began to intone the <i>Gloria
in Excelsis Deo</i>. All hail, thou infinite mind, whose measureless
depths mortal man has not even begun to sound! His
soul could echo that strain forever.</p>
<p>He turned to the Lesson and read: &ldquo;But there went up a
mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground.&rdquo; He
stopped a moment for thought. The <i>Lord</i> God! The mist of
error watered the false thought&ndash;&ndash;the one lie about God&ndash;&ndash;and
out of it formed the man of flesh, the false concept which is
held in the minds of mortals. Aye, it was the lie, posing as
the Lord of creation, which had formed its false man out of
the dust of the ground, and had forced it upon the acceptance
of mankind! Jos&egrave; turned back and read the whole of the first
chapter of Genesis, where he felt that he stood upon truth.</p>
<p>The tapers on the altar flickered fitfully. The disturbed
bats blundered among the rafters overhead. Outside, the dusty
roads burned with a white glare. Within, he and the people
were worshiping God. Worship? This? &ldquo;God is a spirit, and
they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
truth.&rdquo; In <i>Truth</i>!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; recited the Nicene creed, with the thought that its
man-made fetters had bound the Christian world for dreary
centuries. Then, the Preface and Canon concluded, he pronounced
the solemn words of consecration which turned the
bread and wine before him into the flesh and blood of Christ
Jesus. He looked at the wafer and the chalice long and
earnestly. He&ndash;&ndash;Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n&ndash;&ndash;mortal, human, a weakling
among weaklings&ndash;&ndash;could he command God by his &ldquo;<i>Hoc est
enim corpus meum</i>&rdquo; to descend from heaven to this altar?
Could he so invoke the power of the Christ as to change bread
and wine into actual flesh and blood? And yet, with all the
priestly powers which Holy Church had conferred upon him,
he could not heal a single bodily ill, nor avert one human
misfortune!</p>
<p>Ah, pagan Rome! Well have you avenged yourself upon
those who wrought your fall, for in the death conflict you left
the taint of your paganism upon them, and it endures in their
sons even to this fair day!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page79' name='book2_page79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; deferred his sermon until the close of the service. He
wanted time to think over again what he could say to these
simple people. They sat before him, dull, inert, yet impressionable&ndash;&ndash;bare
of feet, or wearing hempen sandals, and clad in
cheap cottons and calicos, with here and there a flash of bright
ribbon among the women, and occasionally a parasol of brilliant
hue, which the owner fondly clasped, while impatiently
awaiting the close of the service that she might proudly parade
it. A few of the men wore starched linen shirts, but without
collars. The Alcalde, with his numerous family, and the
family of Don Felipe Alcozer, sat well in front. The former
regarded Jos&egrave; expectantly, as the priest turned to deliver his
simple sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; began, &ldquo;when the good man whom we
call the Saviour sent his disciples out into the world he told
them to preach the gospel and heal the sick. We have no
record that he asked them to do more, for that included his
whole mission. I am here to do his work. And, as I believe
myself to have been led to you, so I shall preach what I believe
to be given me by the great Father of us all. I shall teach
you the Christ as I comprehend him. I would I could heal
the sick as well. But the gift of healing which Jesus bestowed
has been lost to mankind.&rdquo; He paused and seemed to think
deeply. Then he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your servant, and your friend. I want you to believe
that whatever I do in your midst and whatever I say to you
follows only after I have prayerfully considered your welfare.
As time has passed I have seemed to see things in a clearer
light than before. What I may see in the future I shall point
out to you as you are able to understand me. To that end we
must suffer many things to be as they are for the present, for
I am learning with you. I shall give you a single thought to
take with you to-day. Jesus once said, &lsquo;As a man thinketh, so
is he.&rsquo; I want you to remember that, if you would be well and
happy and prosperous, you must think only about good things.
Some day you will see why this is so. But go back now to
your <i>fincas</i> and your fishing, to your little stores and your
humble homes, firmly resolving never to think a bad thought,
whether about yourself or your neighbor. And pray for yourselves
and me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked off into the gloom overhead. Again he seemed to
hear the Man of Galilee: &ldquo;Ask and ye shall receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, my children&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought suddenly of Carmen and her visits to the shales.
His face shone for a moment with a new light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;let your prayers be no mere requests that God will bless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page80' name='book2_page80'></a>80</span>
us, but rather let them be statements that He is infinite good,
and that He cannot do otherwise than give us all we need. No,
I ask not that you intercede for me; nor shall I do so for you.
But I do ask that you join with me in trying to realize that
God is good; that He loves us as His dear children; and that
He is daily, hourly pouring out His inexhaustible goodness
upon us. We shall all see that goodness when we learn to
think no evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes rested upon Carmen as he spoke these last words.
Then with a simple invocation he dismissed the congregation.</p>
<p>The Alcalde carried Jos&egrave; off to dinner with him, much
against the inclination of the priest, who preferred to be alone.
But the Alcalde was the chief influence in the town, and it
was policy to cultivate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessed Virgin shows that she has not forgotten Simit&iacute;,
Padre, by sending you here,&rdquo; said Don Mario, when they were
seated in the shade of the ample <i>patio</i>.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew the Alcalde was sounding him. &ldquo;Yes, friend,&rdquo;
with just a trace of amusement in his voice. &ldquo;It was doubtless
because of the Virgin that I was directed here,&rdquo; he replied,
thinking of Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent advice that you gave the people, Padre; but it
is not likely they understood you, poor fools! Now if Padre
Diego had been preaching he would have ranted like a windstorm;
but he would have made an impression. I am afraid
soft words will not sink into their thick skulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was served in the open, during which the Alcalde
chattered volubly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Rosendo returns soon?&rdquo; he finally ventured. Jos&egrave;
knew that for some time he had been edging toward the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe, se&ntilde;or!</i>&rdquo; replied the priest, with a careless
shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! he is old to prospect for gold&ndash;&ndash;and alone,
too!&rdquo; Don Mario eyed Jos&egrave; sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you priests!&rdquo; he burst out laughing. &ldquo;You are all
alike when it comes to money. Padre Diego was up to the
same schemes; and before he left he had a hat full of titles to
mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not seeking to acquire mineral property!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jos&egrave; with some aspersion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Then you had nothing to do with Rosendo&rsquo;s trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; kept silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, let us be confidential,&rdquo; said the Alcalde, hitching
his chair closer to the priest. &ldquo;Look, I understand why
Rosendo went into the Guamoc&oacute; country&ndash;&ndash;but you can trust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page81' name='book2_page81'></a>81</span>
me to say nothing about it. Only, Padre, if he should find the
mine he will have trouble enough to hold it. But I can help
you both. You know the denouncement papers must go
through my hands, and I send them to Cartagena for registration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat back in his chair with a knowing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one man here to be afraid of,&rdquo; he resumed;
&ldquo;and that is Don Felipe Alcozer; although he may never return
to Simit&iacute;.&rdquo; He reflected a few moments. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Padre, let us have some understanding about interests
in the mine, should Rosendo find it. The mine will be
useless to us unless we work it, for there is no one to buy it
from us. To work it, we must have a stamp-mill, or <i>arrastras</i>.
The Antioquanians are skilled in the making of wooden stamp-mills;
but one would cost perhaps two thousand <i>pesos oro</i>.
Nobody here can furnish so much money but Don Felipe. I
will arrange with him for a suitable interest. And I will fix
all the papers so that the title will be held by us three. Rosendo
is only a <i>peon</i>. You can pay him for his trouble, and
he need not have an interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; breathed easier while this recital was in progress. So
Don Mario believed Rosendo to have gone in search of the lost
mine, La Libertad! Good; for Cartagena would soon get the
report, and his own tenure of the parish would be rendered
doubly sure thereby. The monthly greasing of Wenceslas&rsquo;
palm with what Rosendo might extract from the Guamoc&oacute;
sands, coupled with the belief that Jos&egrave; was maintaining a man
in the field in search of Don Ignacio&rsquo;s lost mine, rendered
Cartagena&rsquo;s interference a very remote contingency. He almost
laughed as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo will doubtless prospect for some months, Don
Mario, and I am sure we shall have plenty of time to discuss
any arrangement of interests later, should occasion arise. But
this is the Sabbath day. So let us not talk business any
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the afternoon heat began to wane, Jos&egrave; left the
Alcalde and returned to his cottage. Since the service of the
morning he had been fighting a constantly deepening sense of
depression. An awful loneliness now gripped his heart, and
dank gloom was again sweeping through the corridors of his
soul. God, what a sacrifice, to remain buried in that dismal
town! His continuance in the priesthood of an abjured faith
was violative of every principle of honesty! The time would
come when the mask of hypocrisy would have to be raised,
and the resultant exposure would be worse then than open
apostasy now!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page82' name='book2_page82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>He entered his dreary little abode and threw himself upon
a chair. There had been no reaction like this for days. He
looked out into the deserted street. Mud hovels; ragged,
thatched roofs; lowly <i>peones</i> drowsing away life&rsquo;s little hour
within! There was scarcely a book in the town. Few of its
inhabitants could even read or write. Culture, education, refinement&ndash;&ndash;all
wanting. Nothing but primal existence&ndash;&ndash;the
barest necessities of real life. He could not stand it! He had
been a fool all his years! He would throw everything to the
winds and go out into the world to live his life as it had been
intended he should live it. He would send his resignation to
the Bishop to-morrow. Then he would hire Juan to take him
to Bodega Central; and the few <i>pesos</i> he had left would get
him to Barranquilla. There he would work until he had earned
enough for his passage to the great States up north, of which
the explorer had told such wonderful tales. Once there, he
could teach, or&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His thought turned to Rosendo. He saw him, bent with
age, and wearied with toil, alone in the awful solitude of the
jungle, standing knee deep in the cold mountain water, while
from early dawn till sunset he incessantly swung the heavy
<i>batea</i> to concentrate the few flakes of precious gold it might
contain. And the old man was facing years of just such loneliness
and heavy toil&ndash;&ndash;facing them gladly.</p>
<p>He thought of Carmen. Was she worth such sacrifice as he
and Rosendo were making? God forgive him! Yes&ndash;&ndash;a thousand
times yes! If he betrayed Rosendo&rsquo;s confidence and fled
like a coward now, leaving her to fall into the sooty hands of
men like Padre Diego, to be crushed, warped, and squeezed
into the molds of Holy Church, could he ever again face his
fellow-men?</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet. &ldquo;Get thee behind me, Satan!&rdquo; he
cried in a voice that echoed through the barren rooms. He
smote his chest and paced the floor. Then he stopped still.
He heard Carmen&rsquo;s voice again. It was the same simple
melody she had sung the day he awoke from his fever. He
stood listening. His eyes filled. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with might,<br />
Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of sight.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>
</div>
<p>In the days that followed, while at times Jos&egrave; still struggled
desperately against the depression of his primal environment,
and against its insidious suggestions of license, Carmen
moved before him like the shechinah of Israel, symbolizing
the divine presence. When the dark hours came and his
pronounced egoism bade fair to overwhelm him; when his self-centered
thought clung with the tenacity of a limpet to his
dreary surroundings and his unfilled longings; when self-condemnation
and self-pity rived his soul, and despair of solving
life&rsquo;s intricate problems settled again like a pall upon him, he
turned to her. Under the soft influence of her instinct for
primitive good, he was learning, even if slowly, to jettison his
heavily laden soul, and day by day to ride the tossing waves
of his stormy thought with a lighter cargo. Her simple faith
in immanent good was working upon his mind like a spiritual
catharsis, to purge it of its clogging beliefs. Her unselfed love
flowed over him like heavenly balm, salving the bleeding
wounds of the spiritual mayhem which he had suffered at
the violent hands of Holy Church&rsquo;s worldly agents.</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s days were filled to the brim with a measure of
joy that constantly overflowed upon all among whom she moved.
Her slight dependence upon her impoverished material environment,
her contempt of its <i>ennui</i>, were constant reminders
to Jos&egrave; that heaven is but a state of mind. Even in desolate
Simit&iacute;, life to her was an endless series of delightful experiences,
of wonderful surprises in the discovery of God&rsquo;s presence
everywhere. Her enthusiasms were always ardent and
inexhaustible. Sparkling animation and abounding vitality
characterized her every movement. Her thought was free, unstrained,
natural, and untrammeled by those inherited and
educated beliefs in evil in which Jos&egrave; had early been so completely
swamped. In worldly knowledge she was the purest
novice; and the engaging <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> with which she met the
priest&rsquo;s explanations of historical events and the motives from
which they sprang charmed him beyond measure, and made
his work with her a constant delight. Her sense of humor was
keen, and her merriment when his recitals touched her risibility
was extravagant. She laughed at danger, laughed at the
weaknesses and foibles of men, when he told of the political
and social ambitions which stirred mankind in the outside
world. But he knew that her merriment proceeded not from an
ephemeral sense of the ludicrous, but from a righteous appraisal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page84' name='book2_page84'></a>84</span>
of the folly and littleness of those things for which
the world so sorely strives.</p>
<p>And daily the little maid wrapped herself about his heart.
Daily her wondrous love coiled its soft folds tighter around
him, squeezing from his atrabilious soul, drop by drop, its
sad taciturnity and inherent morbidness, that it might later fill
his empty life with a spiritual richness which he had never
known before.</p>
<p>On the day following the opening of the church Carmen
had asked many questions. It was the first religious service
she had ever voluntarily attended. To her former queries regarding
the function of the church edifice, Rosendo had vouchsafed
but one reply: it was the house of God, and in it the
people used to gather to learn of Him. But she protested that
she had no need of the musty, ramshackle, barn-like old
building as a locus in which to center her thought upon God.
She walked with Him, and she much preferred the bright,
sunlit out-of-doors in which to commune with Him. Jos&egrave; explained
the need of a central gathering place as a shelter from
the hot sun. But the images&ndash;&ndash;the pictures of Saints and
Virgin&ndash;&ndash;and the Mass itself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are what the people are accustomed to, dear child,
to direct their thought toward God,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And we
will use them until we can teach them something better.&rdquo; He
had omitted from the church service as far as possible the
collects and all invocations addressed to the Virgin and the
Saints, and had rendered it short and extremely simple. Carmen
seemed satisfied with his explanation, and with his insistence
that, for the sake of appearance, she attend the Sunday
services. He would trust her God to guide them both.</p>
<p>The days sped by silently and swiftly. Jos&egrave; and the child
dwelt together apart from the world, in a universe purely
mental. As he taught her, she hung upon his every word, and
seized the proffered tutelage with avidity. Often, after the
day&rsquo;s work, Jos&egrave;, in his customary strolls about the little town,
would come across the girl in the doorway of a neighboring
house, with a group of wide-eyed youngsters about her, relating
again the wonder-tales which she had gathered from
him. Marvelous tales they were, too, of knight and <i>hidalgo</i>,
of court and camp, of fairies, pyxies, gnomes and sprites, of
mossy legend and historic fact, bubbling from the girl&rsquo;s childish
lips with an engaging <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of interpretation that held the
man enchanted. Even the schoolmaster, who had besought
Jos&egrave; in vain to turn Carmen over to him, was often a spellbound
listener at these little gatherings.</p>
<p>The result was that in a short time a delegation, headed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page85' name='book2_page85'></a>85</span>
by the Alcalde himself, waited upon Jos&egrave; and begged him to
lecture to the people of Simit&iacute; in the church building at least
two or three evenings a week upon places and people he had
seen in the great world of which they knew nothing. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
eyes were moist as he looked at the great, brawny men, stout
of heart, but simple as children. He grieved to give up his
evenings, for he had formed the habit of late of devoting them
to the study of his Bible, and to meditation on those ideas
which had so recently come to him. But the appeal from these
innocent, untutored people again quenched the thought of
self, and he bade them be assured that their request was
granted.</p>
<p>The new ideas which had found entrance into Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s liberated
mentality in the past few days had formed a basis on
which he was not afraid to stand while teaching Carmen; and
his entire instruction was thenceforth colored by them. He
knew not why, in all the preceding years, such ideas had not
come to him before. But he was to learn, some day, that his
previous tenacious clinging to evil as a reality, together with
his material beliefs and his worldly intellectuality, had stood
as barriers at the portals of his thought, and kept the truth
from entering. His mind had been already full&ndash;&ndash;but its contents
were unbelief, fear, the conviction of evil as real and
operative, and the failure to know God as immanent, omnipotent
and perfect mind, to whom evil is forever unknown and
unreal. Pride, egoism, and his morbid sense of honesty had
added their portion to the already impassable obstruction at
the gateway of his thought. And so the error had been kept
within, the good without. The &ldquo;power of the Lord&rdquo; had not
been absent; but it had remained unapplied. Thus he had
wandered through the desolate wilderness; but yet sustained
and kept alive, that he should not go down to the pit.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s days were now so crowded that he was forced to
borrow heavily from the night. The Alcalde continued his
unctuous flattery, and the priest, in turn, cultivated him assiduously.
To that official&rsquo;s query as to the restitution of the confessional
in the church, the priest replied that he could spare
time to hear only such confessions from his flock as might be
necessary to elicit from him the advice or assistance requisite
for their needs. He was there to help them solve their life
problems, not to pry into their sacred secrets; and their confessions
must relate only to their necessities.</p>
<p>The Alcalde went away with a puzzled look. Of a truth a
new sort of priest had now to be reckoned with in Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;a
very different sort from Padre Diego.</p>
<p>In the first days of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s incumbency he found many serious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page86' name='book2_page86'></a>86</span>
matters to adjust. He had learned from Rosendo that
not half the residents of Simit&iacute; were married to the consorts
with whom they lived, and that many of the children who
played in the streets did not know who their fathers were. So
prevalent was this evil condition that the custom among the
men of having their initials embroidered upon the bosoms of
their shirts was extended to include the initial of the mother&rsquo;s
family name. Jos&egrave; had questioned Rosendo as to the meaning
of the letters R. A. S. upon his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The S, Padre, is the initial of my mother&rsquo;s family name.
I am Rosendo Ariza, son of the daughter of Saurez. My
parents were married by a priest. But half the people of
Simit&iacute; have never been really married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sought the cause of this dereliction. Fidel Avila was
living with a woman, by whom he had three children. The
priest summoned him to the parish house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fidel,&rdquo; he questioned sternly, &ldquo;Jacinta, the woman you
live with, is your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were married by the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was there a priest here when you began to live with
Jacinta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre. The <i>Cura</i>, Don Diego Polo, was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why were you not married by him? Do you not
know how wicked it is to live as you are doing? Think of
your children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, and I asked the <i>Cura</i>, Don Diego, to marry
us. But he charged twenty <i>pesos oro</i> for doing it; and I could
not afford it. I loved Jacinta. And so we decided to live together
without the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; stopped. He knew that the Church recognized
no marriage unless it were performed by a priest. The
civil magistrate had no jurisdiction in such a case. And a
former priest&rsquo;s rapacity had resulted in forcing illegitimacy
upon half the children of this benighted hamlet, because of
their parents&rsquo; inability to afford the luxury of a canonical
marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fidel, were your father and mother married?&rdquo; he asked
in kinder tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Padre. Only a few people in Guamoc&oacute; can
afford to pay to be married. The men and women live together,
perhaps for all time, perhaps for only a few months.
If a man wishes to leave his woman and live with another, he
does so. If there are children, the woman always has to keep
and care for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page87' name='book2_page87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And could you leave Jacinta if you wished, and live with
another woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she would have to lake care of your children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all because you are not married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> But that will do, Fidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, the sordid greed of those who abuse their sacred commission!
What punishment is mete for such as exploit these
lowly folk in the name of religion! Jos&egrave; strode off to consult
the Alcalde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario, the men in Simit&iacute; who are living with women
have <i>got</i> to be married to them! It is shameful! I shall make
a canvass of the town at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde laughed. &ldquo;<i>Costumbre</i>, Padre. You can&rsquo;t
change it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Costumbre del pa&iacute;s!</i> It is a final answer all through South
America. No matter how unreasonable a thing may be, if it
is the custom of the country it is a Medean law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know this is subversive of Church discipline!&rdquo;
Jos&egrave; retorted warmly. &ldquo;Look you, Don Mario,&rdquo; he added suggestively,
&ldquo;you and I are to work together, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde blinked his pig eyes, but thought hard about
La Libertad. <i>&ldquo;Cierto, Se&ntilde;or Padre!&rdquo;</i> he hastened to exclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I demand that you summon before me every man
and woman who are living together unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a thought single to his own future advantage, the
wary Alcalde complied. Within the week following this interview
Jos&egrave; married twenty couples, and without charge. Some
offered him a few <i>pesos</i>. These he took and immediately
turned over to Don Mario as treasurer of the parish. Those
couples who refused to be married were forced by the Alcalde
to separate. But of these there were few. Among them was
one Julio Gomez. Packing his few household effects upon his
back, and muttering imprecations against the priest, Gomez
set out for the hills, still followed by his woman, with a babe
slung over her shoulders and two naked children toddling at
her bare heels.</p>
<p>Verily, the ancient town was being profoundly stirred by
the man who had sought to find his tomb there. Gradually the
people lost their suspicions and distrust, bred of former bitter
experience with priests, and joined heartily with Jos&egrave; to
ameliorate the social status of the place. His sincere love for
them, and his utter selflessness, secured their confidence, and
ere his first month among them closed, he had won them,
almost to a man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page88' name='book2_page88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>Meantime, six weeks had passed since Rosendo had departed
to take up his lonely task of self-renouncing love. Then one
day he returned, worn and emaciated, his great frame shaking
like a withered leaf in a chill blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the <i>terciana</i>, Padre,&rdquo; he said, as he sank shuddering
upon his bed. &ldquo;It comes every third day. I went as far as
Tach&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;fifty leagues from Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;and there the fever overtook
me. I have been eight days coming back; and day before
yesterday I ran out of food. Last evening I found a wild melon
at the side of the trail. A coral snake struck at me when I
reached for it, but he hit my <i>machete</i> instead. <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; pressed his wet hand, while Do&ntilde;a Maria laid damp
cloths upon his burning forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The streams are washed out, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo continued
sadly. &ldquo;I worked at Colorado, Popales, and Tambora. But I
got no more than five <i>pesos</i> worth. And that will not pay for
half of my supplies. It is there in a little bag,&rdquo; pointing to
his soaked and muddy kit.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart was wrung by the suffering and disappointment
of the old man. Sadly he carried the little handful of
gold flakes to Don Mario, and then returned to the exhausted
Rosendo.</p>
<p>All through the night the sick man tossed and moaned. By
morning he was delirious. Then Jos&egrave; and Do&ntilde;a Maria became
genuinely alarmed. The toil and exposure had been too
much for Rosendo at his advanced age. In his delirium he
talked brokenly of the swamps through which he had floundered,
for he had taken the trail in the wet season, and fully
half of its one hundred and fifty miles of length was oozy
and all but impassable bog.</p>
<p>By afternoon the fever had greatly increased. Don Mario
shook his head as he stood over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen many in that condition, Padre, and they didn&rsquo;t
wake up! If we had quinine, perhaps he might be saved. But
there isn&rsquo;t a flake in the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then send Juan to Bodega Central at once for it!&rdquo; cried
Jos&egrave;, wild with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he would find it there either, Padre. But we
can try. However, Juan cannot make the trip in less than two
days. And I fear Rosendo will not last that long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria sat by the bedside, dumb with grief. Jos&egrave;
wrung his hands in despair. The day drew slowly to a close.
The Alcalde had dispatched Juan down to the river to signal
any steamer that he should meet, if perchance he might purchase
a few grains of the only drug that could save the sick
man. Carmen had absented herself during the day; but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page89' name='book2_page89'></a>89</span>
returned in time to assist Do&ntilde;a Maria with the evening meal,
after which she went at once to her bed.</p>
<p>Late at night, when the sympathizing townsmen had sorrowfully
departed and Jos&egrave; had induced Do&ntilde;a Maria to seek a
few moments rest on her <i>petate</i> in the living room, Carmen
climbed quietly out of her bed and came to where the priest
sat alone with the unconscious Rosendo.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was bending over the delirious man. &ldquo;Oh, if Jesus
were only here now!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked down into the little face beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t die, you know. They don&rsquo;t really die.&rdquo; The
little head shook as if to emphasize the words.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was startled. But he put his arm about the child and
drew her to him. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>, why do you say that?&rdquo; he asked
sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because God doesn&rsquo;t die, you know,&rdquo; she quickly replied.
&ldquo;And we are like Him, Padre, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But He calls us to Him, <i>chiquita</i>. And&ndash;&ndash;I guess&ndash;&ndash;He is&ndash;&ndash;is
calling your padre Rosendo now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does God kill mankind in order to give them life? Is that
His way? Death denies God, eternal Life. And&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Padre,&rdquo; returned the innocent child. &ldquo;He is
always here; and we are always with Him, you know. He can
not call people away from where He is, can He?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.</i> The
Christ-principle, the saving truth about God and man, is ever
present in an uncomprehending world.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew that there was no material dependence now.
Something told him that Rosendo lay dying. There was no
physician, no drug, in the isolated little town. There was none
but God to save. And He&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But only sinners are taught by priests and preachers to
look to God for help. The sick are not so taught. How much
more deplorable, then, is their condition than that of the
wicked!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told God out on the shales this afternoon that I just
knew padre Rosendo wouldn&rsquo;t die!&rdquo; The soft, sweet voice
hovered on the silence like celestial melody.</p>
<p><i>If ye ask anything in my name</i>&ndash;&ndash;in my character&ndash;&ndash;<i>it shall
be given you</i>. Carmen asked in the character of the sinless
Christ, for her asking was an assertion of what she instinctively
knew to be truth, despite the evidence of the physical
senses. Her petitions were affirmations of Immanuel&ndash;&ndash;God
with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; whispered the priest hoarsely, &ldquo;go back to your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page90' name='book2_page90'></a>90</span>
bed, and know, just <i>know</i> that God is here! Know that He
did not make padre Rosendo sick, and that He will not let him
die! Know it for him&ndash;&ndash;and for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, I know that now!&rdquo; The child looked up
into the priest&rsquo;s face with her luminous eyes radiating unshaken
trust&ndash;&ndash;a trust that seemed born of understanding. Yea,
she knew that all good was there, for God is omnipotent. They
had but to stretch forth their hands to touch the robe of His
Christ. The healing principle which cleansed the lepers and
raised the dead was even with them there in that quiet room.
Jos&egrave; had only to realize it, nothing doubting. Carmen had done
her work, and her mind now was stayed on Him. Infinite Intelligence
did not know Rosendo as Jos&egrave; was trying to know
him, sick and dying. God is Life&ndash;&ndash;and there is no death!</p>
<p>Carmen was again asleep. Jos&egrave; sat alone, his open Bible before
him and his thought with his God.</p>
<p>Oh, for even a slight conception of Him who is Life! Moses
worked &ldquo;as seeing Him who is invisible.&rdquo; Carmen lived with
her eyes on Him, despite her dreary mundane encompassment.
And Jos&egrave;, as he sat there throughout the watches of
the night, facing the black terror, was striving to pierce the
mist which had gone up from the face of the ground and was
separating him from his God. Through the long, dark hours,
with the quiet of death upon the desolate chamber, he sat
mute before the veil that was &ldquo;still untaken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was it that kept telling him that Rosendo lay dying
before him? Does matter talk? Did the serpent talk to Eve?
Do fleshly nerves and frail bodily organs converse with men?
Can the externalization of thought report back to the thought
itself? Nay, the report came to him from the physical senses&ndash;&ndash;naught
else. And they reported&ndash;&ndash;nothing! He was seeing but
his own thoughts of mixed good and evil. And they were
false, because they testified against God.</p>
<p>Surely God knew Rosendo. But not as the physical senses
were trying to make Jos&egrave; know him, sick and dying. Surely
the subjective determines the objective; for as we think, so are
we&ndash;&ndash;the Christ said that. From his human standpoint Jos&egrave;
was seeing his thoughts of a dying mortal. And now he was
trying to know that those thoughts did not come from God&ndash;&ndash;that
they had no authority back of them&ndash;&ndash;that they were
children of the &ldquo;one lie&rdquo; about God&ndash;&ndash;that they were false,
false as hell, and therefore impotent and unreal.</p>
<p>What, then, had he to fear? Nothing, for truth is beyond
the reach of personal sense. So God and His ideas, reflected by
the real Rosendo, were beyond the reach of evil.</p>
<p>If this were true, then he must clear his own mentality&ndash;&ndash;even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page91' name='book2_page91'></a>91</span>
as he now knew Carmen had done out on the shales that
afternoon. He was no longer dealing with a material Rosendo,
but with false beliefs about a son of God. He was handling
mental concepts. And to the serpent, error, he was trying to
say: &ldquo;What is your authority?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If man lives, he never dies. If man is, then he always has
been. And he was never born&ndash;&ndash;and never passes into oblivion.
A fact never changes. If two and two make four to-day, they
always have done so, and always will.</p>
<p>Can good produce evil? Then evil can have no creator.
Rosendo, when moved by good, had gone into the wilds of
Guamoc&oacute; on a mission of love. Did evil have power to smite
him for his noble sacrifice?</p>
<p>What is this human life of ours? Real existence? No, but
a sense of existence&ndash;&ndash;and a false sense, for it postulates a god
of evil opposed to the one supreme Creator of all that really is.
Then the testimony that said Rosendo must die was cruelly
false. And, more, it was powerless&ndash;&ndash;unless Jos&egrave; himself gave
it power.</p>
<p>Did Carmen know that? Had she so reasoned? Assuredly
no! But she knew God as Jos&egrave; had never known Him. And,
despite the testimony of the fleshly eyes, she had turned from
physical sense to Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not practicable!&rdquo; the world cries in startled protest.</p>
<p>But, behold her life!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had begun to see that discord was the result of unrighteousness,
false thought. He began to understand why it
was that Jesus always linked disease with sin. His own paradoxical
career had furnished ample proof of that. Yet his
numberless tribulations were not due solely to his own wrong
thinking, but likewise to the wrong thought of others with respect
to him, thought which he knew not how to neutralize.
And the channels for this false, malicious, carnal thought had
been his beloved parents, his uncle, the Archbishop, his tutors,
and, in fact, all with whom he had been associated until he
came to Simit&iacute;. There he had found Carmen. And there the
false thought had met a check, a reversal. The evil had begun
to destroy itself. And he was slowly awaking to find nothing
but good.</p>
<p>The night hours flitted through the heavy gloom like spectral
acolytes. Rosendo sank into a deep sleep. The steady roll
of the frogs in the lake at length died away. A flush stole timidly
across the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, he will not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Carmen&rsquo;s voice that awoke the slumbering priest.
The child stood at his side, and her little hand clasped his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page92' name='book2_page92'></a>92</span>
Rosendo slept. His chest rose and fell with the rhythmic
breathing. Jos&egrave; looked down upon him. A great lump came
into his throat, and his voice trembled as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, <i>chiquita</i>. Go, call your madre Maria now,
and I will go home to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>
</div>
<p>That day Rosendo left his bed. Two days later he again
set out for Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> gold there, and I must, I <i>will</i> find it!&rdquo; he
repeatedly exclaimed as he pushed his preparations.</p>
<p>The courage of the man was magnificent. On its rebound
it carried him over the protest of Do&ntilde;a Maria and the gloomy
forebodings of his fellow-townsmen, and launched him again on
the desolate trail.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; had uttered no protest. He moved about wrapped
in undefinable awe. For he believed he had seen Rosendo
lifted from the bed of death. And no one might tell him that
it was not by the same power that long ago had raised the dead
man of Nain. Carmen had not spoken of the incident again;
and something laid a restraint upon Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Alcalde bulged with astonishment when
Rosendo entered his store that morning in quest of further supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> Go back to your bed, <i>compadre</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
bounding from his chair. &ldquo;You are walking in your delirium!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, amigo</i>,&rdquo; replied Rosendo with a smile, &ldquo;the fever has
left me. And now I must have another month&rsquo;s supplies, for
I go back to Guamoc&oacute; as soon as my legs tremble less.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba! caramba!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Alcalde acted as if he were in the presence of a ghost.
But at length becoming convinced that Rosendo was there on
matters of business, and in his right mind, he checked further
expression of wonder and, with a shrug of his fat shoulders,
assumed his wonted air of a man of large affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can allow you five <i>pesos oro</i> on account of the gold which
the <i>Cura</i> brought me yesterday,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;But that
leaves you still owing ten <i>pesos</i> for your first supplies; and
thirty if I give you what you ask for now. If you cannot pay
this amount when you return, you will have to work it out for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His little eyes grew steely and cold. Rosendo well knew
what the threat implied. But he did not falter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page93' name='book2_page93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, compadre</i>,&rdquo; he quietly replied, &ldquo;it will be as you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that afternoon Juan returned from Bodega Central
with a half ounce of quinine. He had made the trip with
astonishing celerity, and had arrived at the riverine town just
as a large steamer was docking. The purser supplied him
with the drug, and he immediately started on his return.</p>
<p>The Alcalde set out to deliver the drug to Rosendo; but not
finding him at home, looked in at the parish house. Jos&egrave; and
Carmen were deep in their studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, but I have the medicine
you ordered for Rosendo,&rdquo; placing the small package upon the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may set it down against me, Don Mario,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the Alcalde, &ldquo;this must not be charged to
the parish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said to me, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; replied the priest firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same thing, Padre!&rdquo; blurted the petty merchant.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s anger began to rise, but he restrained it. &ldquo;Padre
Diego is no longer here, you must remember,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the parish pays your debts; and it would not pay the
full value of this and Juan&rsquo;s trip,&rdquo; was the coarse retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Don Mario,&rdquo; answered Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;You may
charge it to Rosendo. But tell me first how much you will
place against him for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde reflected a moment. &ldquo;The quinine will be five
<i>pesos oro</i>, and Juan&rsquo;s trip three additional. Is it not worth
it?&rdquo; he demanded, blustering before Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s steady gaze. &ldquo;If
Rosendo had been really sick it would have saved his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not believe he was dangerously ill?&rdquo; asked
Jos&egrave; with some curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have been really sick and be around to-day&ndash;&ndash;could
he?&rdquo; the Alcalde demanded.</p>
<p>The priest glanced at Carmen. She met the look with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;not <i>really</i> sick.&rdquo; Then he quickly
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you charge Rosendo eight <i>pesos</i> for that bit of quinine,
Don Mario, you and I are no longer working together, for I do
not take base advantage of any man&rsquo;s necessities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde became confused. He was going too far. &ldquo;<i>Na,
Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; he said hastily, with a sheepish grin. &ldquo;I will
leave the quinine with you, and do you settle the account with
Juan.&rdquo; With which he beat a disordered retreat.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was thankful that, for a few months, at least, he would
have a powerful hold on this man through his rapacity. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page94' name='book2_page94'></a>94</span>
would happen when the Alcalde at length learned that Rosendo
was not searching for Don Ignacio&rsquo;s lost mine, he did not care
to conjecture. That matter was in other hands than his, and he
was glad to leave it there. He asked now only to see each
single step as he progressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Don Mario say that stuff would cure padre Rosendo?&rdquo;
asked Carmen, pointing to the quinine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he say so, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he really believed it, <i>carita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it, Padre&ndash;&ndash;and how can it cure sick people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the bark of a certain tree, little one, that people take
as medicine. It is a sort of poison which people take to counteract
another poison. A great school of medicine is founded
upon that principle, Carmen,&rdquo; he added. And then he fell to
wondering if it really was a principle, after all. If so, it was
evil overcoming evil. But would the world believe that both
he and Rosendo had been cured by&ndash;&ndash;what? Faith? True
prayer? By the operation of a great, almost unknown principle?
Or would it scoff at such an idea?</p>
<p>But what cared he for that? He saw himself and Rosendo
restored, and that was enough. He turned to the child. &ldquo;They
think the quinine cures fever, little one,&rdquo; he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does it?&rdquo; The little face wore an anxious look as she
put the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think it does, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; replied the priest, wondering
what he should say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is just because they think so that they get well,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; the girl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it is, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they thought right they would be cured without
this&ndash;&ndash;is it not so, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it&ndash;&ndash;now,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;In fact, if they
always kept their thoughts right I am sure they would never
be sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, if they always thought about God,&rdquo; the child
amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I mean just that. If they knew, <i>really knew</i>, that
God is everywhere, that He is good, and that He never makes
people sick, they would always be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Padre. It is only their bad thoughts that make
them sick. And even then they are not really sick,&rdquo; the child
concluded. &ldquo;They think they are, and they think they die&ndash;&ndash;and
then they wake up and find it isn&rsquo;t so at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the child made this remark to him a few weeks before,
he had crushed it with the dull, lifeless, conventional formul&aelig;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page95' name='book2_page95'></a>95</span>
of human belief. To-day in penitent humility he was trying to
walk hand in hand with her the path she trod. For he was
learning from her that righteousness is salvation. A few weeks
ago he had lain at death&rsquo;s door, yearning to pass the portal.
Yesterday he believed he had again seen the dark angel, hovering
over the stricken Rosendo. But in each case <i>something</i> had
intervened. Perhaps that &ldquo;something not ourselves that makes
for righteousness,&rdquo; the unknown, almost unacknowledged force
that ceases not to combat evil in the human consciousness.
Clinging to his petty egoisms; hugging close his shabby convictions
of an evil power opposed to God; stuffed with worldly
learning and pride of race and intellect, in due season, as he
sank under the burden of his imaginings, the veil had been
drawn aside for a fleeting moment&ndash;&ndash;and his soul had frozen
with awe at what it beheld!</p>
<p>For, back of the density of the human concept, the fleeting,
inexplicable medley of good and evil which constitutes the
phenomenon of mortal existence, <i>he had seen God</i>! He had
seen Him as all-inclusive mind, omnipotent, immanent, perfect,
eternal. He had caught a moment&rsquo;s glimpse of the tremendous
Presence which holds all wisdom, all knowledge, yet knows no
evil. He had seen a blinding flash of that &ldquo;something&rdquo; toward
which his life had strained and yearned. With it had come a
dim perception of the falsity of the testimony of physical sense,
and the human life that is reared upon it. And though he
counted not himself to have apprehended as yet, he was struggling,
even with thanksgiving, up out of his bondage, toward
the gleam. The shafts of error hissed about him, and black
doubt and chill despair still felled him with their awful blows.
But he walked with Carmen. With his hand in hers, he knew
he was journeying toward God.</p>
<p>On the afternoon before his departure Rosendo entered the
parish house in apprehension. &ldquo;I have lost my <i>escapulario</i>,
Padre!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The string caught in the brush, and
the whole thing was torn from my neck. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t like to go
back without one,&rdquo; he added dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you have nothing left but Christ,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;
with fine irony. &ldquo;Well, it is of no consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, it had been blessed by the Bishop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry. Why, the Holy Father himself once
blessed this republic of ours, and now it is about the most unfortunate
country in the whole world! But you are a good
Catholic, Rosendo, so you need not fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo was, indeed, a good Catholic. He accepted the
faith of his fathers without reserve. He had never known any
other. Simple, superstitious, and great of heart, he held with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page96' name='book2_page96'></a>96</span>
rigid credulity to all that had been taught him in the name of
religion. But until Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s advent he had feared and hated
priests. Nevertheless, his faith in signs and miracles and the
healing power of blessed images was child-like. Once when
he saw in the store of Don Mario a colored chromo of Venus
and Cupid, a cheap print that had come with goods imported
from abroad, he had devoutly crossed himself, believing it to
be the Virgin Mary with the Christ-child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will fix you up, Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, noting the man&rsquo;s
genuine anxiety. &ldquo;Have Do&ntilde;a Maria cut out a cloth heart and
fasten it to a stout cord. I will take it to the church altar and
bless it before the image of the Virgin. You told me once that
the Virgin was the Rinc&oacute;n family&rsquo;s patron, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated the pleased Rosendo, as he hastened
off to execute the commission.</p>
<p>Several times before Rosendo went back to Guamoc&oacute; Jos&egrave;
had sought to draw him into conversation about his illness, and
to get his view of the probable cause of his rapid recovery.
But the old man seemed loath to dwell on the topic, and Jos&egrave;
could get little from him. At any mention of the episode a
troubled look would come over his face, and he would fall
silent, or would find an excuse to leave the presence of the
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; abruptly remarked to him as he was busy
with his pack late the night before his departure, &ldquo;will you
take with you the quinine that Juan brought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo looked up quickly. &ldquo;I can not, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On account of Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has she to do with it, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>Rosendo looked embarrassed. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, I promised
her I would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; reflected on the child&rsquo;s unusual request. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you fell sick up in Guamoc&oacute;, Rosendo, what could
you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe</i>, Padre! Perhaps I could gather herbs and
make a tea&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t say anything about
that.&rdquo; He looked at Jos&egrave; and laughed. Then, in an anxious
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, what can I do? The little Carmen asks me not to
take the quinine, and I can not refuse her. But I may get sick.
I&ndash;&ndash;I have always taken medicine when I needed it and could
get it. But the only medicine we have in Simit&iacute; is the stuff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page97' name='book2_page97'></a>97</span>
that some of the women make&ndash;&ndash;teas and drinks brewed from
roots and bark. I have never seen a doctor here, nor any real
medicines but quinine. And even that is hard to get, as you
know. I used to make a salve out of the livers of <i>m&aacute;pina</i>
snakes&ndash;&ndash;it was for the rheumatism&ndash;&ndash;I suffered terribly when
I worked in the cold waters in Guamoc&oacute;. I think the salve
helped me. But if I should get the disease now, would Carmen
let me make the salve again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over his outfit for some moments. &ldquo;She says if I
trust God I will not get sick,&rdquo; he at length resumed. &ldquo;She says
I must not think about it. <i>Caramba!</i> What has that to do
with it? People get sick whether they think about it or not.
Do you believe, Padre, this new <i>escapulario</i> will protect me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s words reflected the strange mixture of mature
and childish thought typical of these untutored jungle folk, in
which longing for the good is so heavily overshadowed by an
educated belief in the power of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, finding at last his opportunity, &ldquo;tell
me, do you think you were seriously ill day before yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe</i>, Padre! Perhaps it was only the <i>terciana</i>, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; pursuing another tack, &ldquo;do you think I was
very sick that day when I rushed to the lake&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, Padre! But you were turning cold&ndash;&ndash;you hardly
breathed&ndash;&ndash;we all thought you must die&ndash;&ndash;all but Carmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what cured me, Rosendo?&rdquo; the priest asked in a low,
steady voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;Padre, I can not say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can I, positively, my friend. But I do know that the
little Carmen said I should not die. And she said the same of
you when, as I would swear, you were in the fell clutches of
the death angel himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Rosendo&rsquo;s eyes were large, and his voice trembled
in awesome whisper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is she&ndash;&ndash;the little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;is she&ndash;&ndash;an
<i>hada</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witch? <i>Hombre!</i> No!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, bursting into a
laugh at the perturbed features of the older man. &ldquo;No, <i>amigo</i>,
she is not an <i>hada</i>! Let us say, rather, as you first expressed
it to me, she is an angel&ndash;&ndash;and let us appreciate her as such.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I tell you in all seriousness, there are
things that such as you and I, with our limited outlook, have
never dreamed of; and that child seems to have penetrated the
veil that hides spiritual things from the material vision of men
like us. Let us wait, and if we value that &lsquo;<i>something</i>&rsquo; which
she seems to possess and know how to use, let us cut off our
right hands before we yield to the temptation to place any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page98' name='book2_page98'></a>98</span>
obstacle in the way of her development along the lines which
she has chosen, or which some unseen Power has chosen for
her. It is for you and me, Rosendo, to stand aside and watch,
while we protect her, if haply we may be privileged some day
to learn her secret in full. You and I are the unlearned,
while she is filled with wisdom. The world would say otherwise,
and would condemn us as fools. Thank God we are out
of the world here in Simit&iacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He choked back the inrush of memories and brushed away a
tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;be advised. If Carmen told you
not to think of sickness while in Guamoc&oacute;, then follow her instructions.
It is not the child, but a mighty Power that is
speaking through her. Of that I have long been thoroughly
convinced. And I am as thoroughly convinced that that same
Power has appointed you and me her protectors and her followers.
You and I have a mighty compact&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; interrupted Rosendo, clasping the priest&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;my life is hers&ndash;&ndash;you know it&ndash;&ndash;she has only to speak, and I
obey! Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, Rosendo,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;And now a final
word. Let us keep solely to ourselves what we have learned
of her. Our plans are well formulated. Let us adhere to them
in strict silence. I know not whither we are being led. But we
are in the hands of that &lsquo;something&rsquo; that speaks and works
through her&ndash;&ndash;and we are satisfied. Are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They clasped hands again. The next morning Rosendo set
his face once more toward the emerald hills of Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<p>As the days passed, Jos&egrave; became more silent and thoughtful.
But it was a silence bred of wonder and reverence, as he dwelt
upon the things that had been revealed to him. Who and what
was this unusual child, so human, and yet so strangely removed
from the world&rsquo;s plane of thought? A child who understood
the language of the birds, and heard the grass grow&ndash;&ndash;a
child whom Torquemada would have burnt as a witch, and
yet with whom he could not doubt the Christ dwelt.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; often studied her features while she bent over her
work. He spent hours, too, poring over the little locket which
had been found among her mother&rsquo;s few effects. The portrait
of the man was dim and soiled. Jos&egrave; wondered if the poor
woman&rsquo;s kisses and tears had blurred it. The people of Badillo
said she had died with it pressed to her lips. But its condition
rendered futile all speculation in regard to its original. That
of the mother, however, was still fresh and clear. Jos&egrave; conjectured
that she must have been either wholly Spanish, or one
of the more refined and cultured women of Colombia. And she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page99' name='book2_page99'></a>99</span>
had doubtless been very young and beautiful when the portrait
was made. With what dark tragedy was that little locket associated?
Would it ever yield its secret?</p>
<p>But Carmen&rsquo;s brown curls and light skin&ndash;&ndash;whence came
they? Were they wholly Latin? Jos&egrave; had grave doubts. And
her keen mind, and deep religious instinct? Who knew? He
could only be sure that they had come from a source far, far
above her present lowly environment. With that much he
must for the present be content.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Another month unfolded its length in quiet days, and Rosendo
again returned. Not ill this time, nor even much exhausted.
Nor did the little leathern pouch contain more than
a few <i>pesos</i> in gold dust. But determination was written grim
and trenchant upon his black face as he strode into the parish
house and extended his great hand to the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only come for more supplies, Padre,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
have some three <i>pesos</i> worth of gold. Most of this I got around
Culata, near Don Felipe&rsquo;s quartz vein, the Andandodias. <i>Caramba</i>,
what veins in those hills! If we had money to build a
mill, and knew how to catch the gold, we would not need to
wash the river sands that have been gone over again and again
for hundreds of years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thoughts were of the Alcalde. He determined to
send for him at once, while Rosendo was removing the soil of
travel.</p>
<p>Don Mario came and estimated the weight of the gold by
his hand. Then he coolly remarked: &ldquo;<i>Bien, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, I will
send Rosendo to my <i>hacienda</i> to-morrow to cut cane and make
<i>panela</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is that, Don Mario?&rdquo; inquired Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>The Alcalde began to bluster. &ldquo;He owes me thirty <i>pesos
oro</i>, less this, if you wish me to keep it. I see no likelihood
that he can ever repay me. And so he must now work out his
debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will that take him, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; the Alcalde replied, his eyes
narrowing.</p>
<p>The priest braced himself, and his face assumed an expression
that it had not worn before he came to Simit&iacute;. &ldquo;Look you
now, my friend,&rdquo; he began in tones pregnant with meaning.
&ldquo;I have made some inquiries regarding your system of peonage.
I find that you pay your <i>peones</i> from twenty to thirty
cents a day for their hard labor, and at the same time charge
them as much a day for food. Or you force them to buy from
you tobacco and rum at prices which keep them always in your
debt. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page100' name='book2_page100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, you have been misinformed,&rdquo; the Alcalde demurred,
with a deprecating gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not. L&aacute;zaro Ortiz is now working for you on that
system. And daily he becomes more deeply indebted to you,
is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless for you to deny it, Don Mario, for I have facts.
Now listen to me. Let us understand each other clearly, nor
attempt to dissimulate. That iniquitous system of peonage has
got to cease in my parish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, but Padre Diego had <i>peones</i>!&rdquo; the Alcalde exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was a wicked man,&rdquo; added Jos&egrave;. Then he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not what information you may have from the Bishop
regarding me, yet this I tell you: I shall report you to
Bogot&aacute;, and I will band the citizens of Simit&iacute; together to drive
you out of town, if you do not at once release L&aacute;zaro, and put
an end to this wicked practice. The people will follow if I
lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bold stroke, and the priest knew that he was standing
upon shaky ground. But the man before him was superstitious,
untutored and child-like. A show of courage, backed by
an assertion of authority, might produce the desired effect.
Moreover, Jos&egrave; knew that he was in the right. And right must
prevail!</p>
<p>Don Mario glared at him, while an ugly look spread over
his coarse features. The priest went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&aacute;zaro has long since worked out his debt, and you shall
release him at once. As to Rosendo, he must have the supplies
he needs to return to Guamoc&oacute;. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; Don Mario&rsquo;s face was purple with rage. &ldquo;You
think you can tell me what to do&ndash;&ndash;me, the Alcalde!&rdquo; he volleyed.
&ldquo;You think you can make us change our customs!
<i>Caramba!</i> You are no better than the priest Diego, whom you
try to make me believe so wicked! <i>Hombre</i>, you were driven
out of Cartagena yourself! A nice sort to be teaching a little
girl&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, man!&rdquo; thundered Jos&egrave;, striding toward him with
upraised arm.</p>
<p>Don Mario fell back in his chair and quailed before the
mountainous wrath of the priest.</p>
<p>A shadow fell across the open doorway. Glancing up, Jos&egrave;
saw Carmen. For a moment the girl stood looking in wonder
at the angry men. Then she went quickly to the priest and
slipped a hand into his. A feeling of shame swept over him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page101' name='book2_page101'></a>101</span>
and he went back to his chair. Carmen leaned against him,
but she appeared to be confused. Silence fell upon them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cucumbra doesn&rsquo;t fight any more, Padre,&rdquo; the girl at length
began in hesitation. &ldquo;He and the puppy play together all the
time now. He has learned a lot, and now he loves the puppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So had the priest learned much. He recalled the lesson.
&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said in soft tones, &ldquo;I think we became a bit too earnest,
Don Mario. We are good friends, is it not so? And we
are working together for the good of Simit&iacute;. But to have good
come to us, we must do good to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to his trunk and took out a wallet. &ldquo;Here are
twenty <i>pesos</i>, Don Mario.&rdquo; It was all he had in the world, but
he did not tell the Alcalde so. &ldquo;Take them on Rosendo&rsquo;s account.
Let him have the new supplies he needs, and I will be
his surety. And, friend, you are going to let me prove to you
with time that the report you have from Cartagena regarding
me is false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario&rsquo;s features relaxed somewhat when his hand
closed over the grimy bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not forget, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; added Jos&egrave;, assuming an air of
mystery as he pursued the advantage, &ldquo;that you and I are associated
in various business matters, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde&rsquo;s mouth twitched, but finally extended in an
unctuous grin. After all, the priest was a descendant of the
famous Don Ignacio, and&ndash;&ndash;who knew?&ndash;&ndash;he might have resources
of which the Alcalde little dreamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto, Padre!</i>&rdquo; he cried, rising to depart. &ldquo;And we will
yet uncover La Libertad! You guarantee Rosendo&rsquo;s debt?
<i>Bien</i>, he shall have the supplies. But I think he should take
another man with him. L&aacute;zaro might do, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a gracious and unlooked for condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send L&aacute;zaro to me, Don Mario,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;We will find
use for him, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus Rosendo was enabled to depart a third time to
the solitudes of Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>
</div>
<p>With Rosendo again on the trail, Jos&egrave; and Carmen bent
once more to their work. Within a few days the grateful
L&aacute;zaro was sent to Rosendo&rsquo;s <i>hacienda</i>, biding the
time when the priest should have a larger commission to bestow
upon him. With the advent of the dry season, peace settled
over the sequestered town, while its artless folk drowsed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page102' name='book2_page102'></a>102</span>
away the long, hot days and danced at night in the silvery
moonlight to the twang of the guitar and the drone of the
amorous canzonet. Jos&egrave; was deeply grateful for these days of
unbroken quiet, and for the opportunity they afforded him to
probe the child&rsquo;s thought and develop his own. Day after day
he taught her. Night after night he visited the members of his
little parish, getting better acquainted with them, administering
to their simple needs, talking to them in the church edifice
on the marvels of the outside world, and then returning to his
little cottage to prepare by the feeble rays of his flickering candle
Carmen&rsquo;s lessons for the following day. He had no texts,
save the battered little arithmetic; and even that was abandoned
as soon as Carmen had mastered the decimal system.
Thereafter he wrote out each lesson for her, carefully wording
it that it might contain nothing to shock her acute sense of the
allness of God, and omitting from the vocabulary every reference
to evil, to failure, disaster, sin and death. In mathematics
he was sure of his ground, for there he dealt wholly with
the metaphysical. But history caused him many an hour of
perplexity in his efforts to purge it of the dross of human
thought. If Carmen were some day to go out into the world
she <i>must</i> know the story of its past. And yet, as Jos&egrave; faced
her in the classroom and looked down into her unfathomable
eyes, in whose liquid depths there seemed to dwell a soul of
unexampled purity, he could not bring himself even to mention
the sordid events in the development of the human race which
manifested the darker elements of the carnal mind. Perhaps,
after all, she might never go out into the world. He had not
the faintest idea how such a thing could be accomplished. And
so under his tutelage the child grew to know a world of naught
but brightness and beauty, where love and happiness dwelt
ever with men, and wicked thoughts were seen as powerless
and transient, harmless to the one who knew God to be &ldquo;everywhere.&rdquo;
The man taught the child with the sad remembrance
of his own seminary training always before him, and with a
desire, amounting almost to frenzy, to keep from her every limiting
influence and benumbing belief of the carnal mind.</p>
<p>The decimal system mastered, Carmen was inducted into
the elements of algebra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How funny,&rdquo; she exclaimed, laughing, &ldquo;to use letters for
numbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only general symbols, little one,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Symbols are signs, or things that stand for other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came suddenly into his mind how the great Apostle
Paul taught that the things we see, or think we see, are themselves
but symbols, reflections as from a mirror, and how we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page103' name='book2_page103'></a>103</span>
must make them out as best we can for the present, knowing
that, in due season, we shall see the realities for which these
things stand to the human mind. He knew that back of the
mathematical symbols stood the eternal, unvarying, indestructible
principles which govern their use. And he had begun to
see that back of the symbols, the phenomena, of human existence
stands the great principle&ndash;&ndash;infinite God&ndash;&ndash;the eternal
mind. In the realm of mathematics the principles are omnipotent
for the solution of problems&ndash;&ndash;omnipotent in the hands of
the one who understands and uses them aright. And is not
God the omnipotent principle to the one who understands and
uses Him aright in the solving of life&rsquo;s intricate problems?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are so easy when you know how, Padre dear,&rdquo; said
Carmen, referring to her tasks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there will be harder ones, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre. But then I shall know more about the rules
that you call principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took up each problem with confidence. Jos&egrave; watched
her eagerly. &ldquo;You do not know what the answer will be,
<i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre dear. But I don&rsquo;t care. If I use the rule in the
right way I shall get the correct answer, shall I not? Look!&rdquo;
she cried joyfully, as she held up her paper with the completed
solution of a problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know that it is correct?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;well, we can prove it&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; She looked up at
him questioningly. Then she bent again over her task and
worked assiduously for some moments in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I worked it back again to the starting point. And
it is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in proving it, little one, you have proved the principle
and established its correctness. Is it not so, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, it shows that the rule is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child lapsed into silence, while Jos&egrave;, as was becoming
his wont, awaited the result of her meditation. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, there are rules for arithmetic, and algebra, and&ndash;&ndash;and
for everything, are there not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, for music, for art, for everything. We can do
nothing correctly without using principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre, there are principles that tell us how to live?&rdquo;
she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your opinion on that point, <i>queridita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just <i>one</i> principle, I guess, Padre dear,&rdquo; she finally ventured,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just God.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page104' name='book2_page104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And God is&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; began, then hesitated. The Apostle
John had dwelt with the Master. What had he urged so often
upon the dull ears of his timid followers?</p>
<p>The child looked up at the priest with a smile whose tenderness
dissolved the rising clouds of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God is&ndash;&ndash;love,&rdquo; he finished softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Padre!&rdquo; The child clapped her little hands and
laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Love! Jesus had said, &ldquo;I and my Father are one.&rdquo; Having
seen him, the world has seen the Father. But Jesus was the
highest manifestation of love that tired humanity has ever
known. &ldquo;Love God!&rdquo; he had cried in tones that have echoed
through the centuries. &ldquo;Love thy neighbor!&rdquo; Aye, love everything,
everybody! Apply the Principle of principles, Love, to
every task, every problem, every situation, every condition!
For what is the Christ-principle but Love? All things are possible
to him who loves, for Love casteth out fear, the root of
every discord. Men ask why God remains hidden from them,
why their understanding of Him is dim. They forget that
God is Love. They forget that to know Him they must first
love their fellow-men. And so the world goes sorrowfully on,
hating, cheating, grasping, abusing; still wondering dully why
men droop and stumble, why they consume with disease, and,
with the despairing conviction that God is unknowable, sinking
at last into oblivion.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;, if he knew aught, knew that Carmen greatly loved&ndash;&ndash;loved
all things deeply and tenderly as reflections of her immanent
God. She had loved the hideous monster that had
crept toward her as she sat unguarded on the lake&rsquo;s rim. Unguarded?
Not so, for the arms of Love were there about her.
She had loved God&ndash;&ndash;good&ndash;&ndash;with unshaken fealty when Rosendo
lay stricken. She had known that Love could not manifest in
death when he himself had been dragged from the lake that
burning afternoon a few weeks before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is the rule, isn&rsquo;t He, Padre dear?&rdquo; The child&rsquo;s unexampled
eyes glowed like burning coals. &ldquo;And we can prove
Him, too,&rdquo; she continued confidently.</p>
<p><i>Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not
open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing
that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</i></p>
<p>Prove Him, O man, that He is Love, and that Love, casting
out hate and fear, solves life&rsquo;s every problem! But first&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bring
ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in mine house.</i> Bring your whole confidence, your trust,
your knowledge of the allness of good, and the nothingness of
evil. Bring, too, your every earthly hope, every mad ambition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page105' name='book2_page105'></a>105</span>
every corroding fear, and carnal belief; lay them down at the
doorway of mine storehouse, and behold their nothingness!</p>
<p>As Carmen approached her simple algebraic problems Jos&egrave;
saw the working of a rule infinite in its adaptation. She knew
not what the answers should be, yet she took up each problem
with supreme confidence, knowing that she possessed and
rightly understood the rule for correctly solving it. She knew
that speculation regarding the probable results was an idle
waste of time. And she likewise knew instinctively that fear
of inability to solve them would paralyze her efforts and
insure defeat at the outset.</p>
<p>Nor could she force solutions to correspond to what she
might think they ought to be&ndash;&ndash;as mankind attempt to force the
solving of their life problems to correspond to human views.
She was glad to work out her problems in the only way they
could be solved. Love, humility, obedience, enabled her to
understand and correctly apply the principle to her tasks. The
results were invariable&ndash;&ndash;harmony and exceeding joy.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had learned another lesson. Again that little hand had
softly swept his harp of life. And again he breathed in unison
with its vibrating chords a deep &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo; Carmen looked up from a brown study.
&ldquo;What does zero really mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands for nothing, child,&rdquo; the priest made reply, wondering
what was to follow this introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the minus sign in algebra is different from the one in
arithmetic. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, if God is all, how can you say there is nothing,
or less than nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest had his answer ready. &ldquo;They are only human
ways of thinking, <i>chiquita</i>. The plus sign always represents
something positive; the minus, something negative. The one
is the opposite of the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an opposite to everything, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest hesitated. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;not a <i>real</i> opposite. But,&rdquo; he added hastily,
&ldquo;we may suppose an opposite to everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s pause ensued. &ldquo;That is what makes people
sick and unhappy, isn&rsquo;t it, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, child?&rdquo; in unfeigned surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing an opposite to God. Supposing that there can
be nothing, when He is everywhere. Doesn&rsquo;t all trouble come
from just supposing things that are not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whence came such questions to the mind of this child?
And why did they invariably lead to astonishing deductions in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page106' name='book2_page106'></a>106</span>
his own? Why did he often give a great start as it dawned
again upon him that he was not talking to one of mature age,
but to a babe?</p>
<p>He tore a strip from the paper in his hand. Relatively the
paper had lost in size and quantity, and there was a distinct
separation. Absolutely, such a thing was an impossibility.
The plus was always positive and real; the minus was always
relative, and stood for unreality. And so it was throughout the
entire realm of thought. <i>Every real thing has its suppositional
opposite.</i> The difficulty is that the human mind, through long
ages of usage, has come to regard the opposite as just as real
as the thing itself. The opposite of love is hate; of health,
disease; of good, evil; of the real, the counterfeit. God is positive&ndash;&ndash;Truth.
His opposite, the negative, is supposition. Oh,
stupid, blundering, dull-eared humanity, not to have realized
that this was just what Jesus said when he defined evil as the
lie about God! No wonder the prophet proclaimed salvation
to be righteousness, right thinking! But would gross humanity
have understood the Master better if he had defined it this way?
No, they would have stoned him on the spot!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew that when both he and Rosendo lay sick unto
death Carmen&rsquo;s thought had been positive, while theirs had
been of the opposite sign. Was her pure thought stronger
than their disbelief? Evidently so. Was this the case with
Jesus? And with the prophets before him, whom the world
laughed to scorn? The inference from Scripture is plain.
What, then, is the overcoming of evil but the driving out of
entrenched human beliefs?</p>
<p>Again Jos&egrave; came back to the thought of Principle. Confucius
had said that heaven was principle. And heaven is
harmony. But had evil any principle? Mankind are accustomed
to speak lightly and knowingly of their &ldquo;principles.&rdquo;
But in their search for the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone they have overlooked
the Principle which the Master used to effect his mighty
works&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that Mind which was in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The Principle
of Jesus was God. And, again, God is Love.</p>
<p>The word evil is a comprehensive term, including errors of
every sort. And yet, in the world&rsquo;s huge category of evils is
there a single one that stands upon a definite principle? Jos&egrave;
had to admit to himself that there was not. Errors in mathematics
result from ignorance of principles, or from their misapplication.
But are the errors real and permanent?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, when I make a mistake, and then go back and do
the problem over and get it right, what becomes of the mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; burst out laughing at the tremendous question. Carmen
joined in heartily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page107' name='book2_page107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo; she pursued, &ldquo;there are rules for solving
problems; but there isn&rsquo;t any rule or principle for making mistakes,
is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely not, child!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I always knew the truth about things, I couldn&rsquo;t
make mistakes, could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; waited for her further comments. They came after a
brief meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, God doesn&rsquo;t know anything about mistakes&ndash;&ndash;does
He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And He knows everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Padre dear, nobody can know anything about mistakes.
People just think they can&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; thought hard for a few moments. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>, can you
know that two and two are seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre dear, how funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;it does seem strange&ndash;&ndash;now. And yet, I used to think
I could know things just as absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what was that, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, <i>chiquita</i>, that I could know evil&ndash;&ndash;something that
God does not and can not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;could you, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child. It is absolutely impossible to know&ndash;&ndash;to really
<i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;error of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we knew it, Padre, it would have a rule; or as you say,
a principle, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, since God is everywhere, He would have to be its
principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the point. Now take another of the problems, <i>chiquita</i>,
and work on it while I think about these things,&rdquo; he
said, assigning another of the simple tasks to the child.</p>
<p>For an idea was running through the man&rsquo;s thought, and
he had traced it back to the explorer in Cartagena. Reason and
logic supported the thought of God as mind; of the creation as
the unfolding of this mind&rsquo;s ideas; and of man as the greatest
idea of God. It also seemed to show that the physical senses
afforded no testimony at all, and that human beings saw, heard
and felt only in thought, in belief. On this basis everything
reduced to a mental plane, and man became a mentality. But
what sort of mentality was that which Jos&egrave; saw all about him
in sinful, sick and dying humanity? The human man is demonstrably
mortal&ndash;&ndash;and he is a sort of mind&ndash;&ndash;ah, yes, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page108' name='book2_page108'></a>108</span>
was it! The explorer had said that up in that great country
north there were those who referred to this sort of mentality
as &ldquo;mortal mind.&rdquo; Jos&egrave; thought it an excellent term. For, if
the mortal man is a mind at all, he assuredly is a <i>mortal</i> mind.</p>
<p>And the mortal mind is the opposite of that mind which is
the eternal God. But God can have no real opposite. Any so-called
opposite to Him must be a supposition&ndash;&ndash;or, as Jesus defined
it, the lie about Him. This lie seems to counterfeit the
eternal mind that is God. It seems to pose as a creative principle,
and to simulate the powers and attributes of God himself.
It assumes to create its universe of matter, the direct opposite
of the spiritual universe. And, likewise, it assumes to create its
man, its own idea of itself, and hence the direct opposite of
the real man, the divine idea of God, made in His own image
and likeness.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; rose and went to the doorway. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he murmured
low, &ldquo;the material personality, called man, which sins,
suffers and dies, is not real man, but his counterfeit, a creation
of God&rsquo;s opposite, the so-called mortal mind. It must be a part
of the lie about God, the &lsquo;mist&rsquo; that went up from the ground
and watered the whole face of the earth, leaving the veil of
supposition which obscures God from human sight. It is this
sort of man and this sort of universe that I have always seen
about me, and that the world refers to as human beings, or
mortals, and the physical universe. And yet I have been looking
only at my false thoughts of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he caught sight of Juan running toward
him from the lake. The lad had just returned from Bodega
Central.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he exclaimed breathlessly, &ldquo;there is war in the
country again! The revolution has broken out, and they are
fighting all along the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned into the house and clasped Carmen in his arms.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_15_1' id='CHAPTER_15_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>
</div>
<p>Juan&rsquo;s startling announcement linked Jos&egrave; again with a fading
past. Standing with his arm about Carmen, while the
child looked up wonderingly at her grimly silent protector,
the priest seemed to have fallen with dizzy precipitation from
some spiritual height into a familiar material world of men
and events. Into his chastened mentality there now rushed a
rabble rout of suggestions, throwing into wild confusion the orderly
forces of mind which he was striving to marshal to meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page109' name='book2_page109'></a>109</span>
the situation. He recalled, for the first time in his new environment,
the significant conversation of Don Jorge and the priest
Diego, in Banco. He saw again the dark clouds that were lowering
above the unhappy country when he left Cartagena. Had
they at last broken? And would carnal lust and rapine again
drench fair Colombia with the blood of her misguided sons?
Were the disturbance only a local uprising, headed by a coterie
of selfish politicians, it would produce but a passing ripple.
Colombia had witnessed many such, and had, by a judicious
redistribution of public offices, generally met the crises with
little difficulty. On the other hand, if the disorder drew its
stimulus from the deep-seated, swelling sentiment of protest
against the continued affiliation of Church and State, then what
might not ensue before reason would again lay her restraining
hand upon the rent nation! For&ndash;&ndash;strange anomaly&ndash;&ndash;no strife
is so venomous, no wars so bloody, no issues so steeped in
deadliest hatred, as those which break forth in the name of the
humble Christ.</p>
<p>A buzzing concourse was gathering in the <i>plaza</i> before the
church. Leaving Carmen in charge of Do&ntilde;a Maria, Jos&egrave; mingled
with the excited people. Juan had brought no definite
information, other than that already imparted to Jos&egrave;, but his
elastic Latin imagination had supplied all lacking essentials,
and now, with much gesticulation and rolling of eyes, with
frequent alternations of shrill chatter and dignified pomp of
phrase, he was portraying in a <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of picturesque and
poetic Spanish the supposed happenings along the great river.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; forced the lad gently aside and addressed the thoroughly
excited people himself, assuring them that no reliable
news was as yet at hand, and bidding them assemble in the
church after the evening meal, where he would advise with
them regarding their future course. He then sought the Alcalde,
and drew him into his store, first closing the door against the
excited multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, what are you going to do?&rdquo; The
Alcalde was atremble with insuppressible excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario, we must protect Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; replied the priest, with
a show of calm which he did not possess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, but not a man will stay! They will run to the
hills! The <i>guerrillas</i> will come, and Simit&iacute; will be burned to
the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stay&ndash;&ndash;with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, and be hacked by the <i>machetes</i> of the <i>guerrillas</i>, or
lassoed by government soldiers and dragged off to the war?&rdquo;
The official mopped the damp from his purple brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;But the Antioquanians will come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page110' name='book2_page110'></a>110</span>
down the Simit&iacute; trail from Remedios and butcher every one
they meet! They hate us Simitanians, since we whipped them
in the revolution of seventy-six! And&ndash;&ndash;<i>Diablo</i>! if we stay here
and beat them back, then the federal troops will come with
their ropes and chains and force us away to fight on their side!
<i>Nombre de Dios!</i> I am for the mountains&ndash;&ndash;<i>pronto</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s own fear mounted by leaps. And yet, in the welter
of conflicting thought two objects stood out above the rest&ndash;&ndash;Carmen
and Rosendo. The latter was on the trail, somewhere.
Would he fall afoul of the bandits who find in these revolutions
their opportunities for plunder and bloodshed? As for Carmen&ndash;&ndash;the
priest&rsquo;s apprehensions were piling mountain-high. He
had quickly forgotten his recent theories regarding the nature
of God and man. He had been swept by the force of ill tidings
clean off the lofty spiritual plane up to which he had struggled
during the past weeks. Again he was befouled in the mire of
material fears and corroding speculations as to the probable
manifestations of evil, real and immanent. Don Mario was
right. He must take the child and fly at once. He would go
to Do&ntilde;a Maria immediately and bid her prepare for the
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had best go to Don Nicol&aacute;s,&rdquo; replied Do&ntilde;a Maria,
when the priest had voiced his fears to her. &ldquo;He lives in Boque,
and has a <i>hacienda</i> somewhere up that river. He will send you
there in his canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Boque is&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hours from Simit&iacute;, across the shales. You must
start with the dawn, or the heat will overtake you before you
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make yourself ready, Do&ntilde;a Maria,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; in relief,
&ldquo;and we will set out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, I will stay here,&rdquo; the woman quietly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here!&rdquo; ejaculated the priest. &ldquo;Impossible! But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be many women too old to leave the town,
Padre. I will stay to help them if trouble comes. And I would
not go without Rosendo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shame fell upon the priest like a blanket. He, the <i>Cura</i>,
was deserting his charge! And this quiet, dignified woman
had shown herself stronger than the man of God! He turned
to the door. Carmen was just entering. He took the child by
the hand and led her to his own cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; he said, as she stood expectantly before him,
&ldquo;we&ndash;&ndash;there is trouble in the country&ndash;&ndash;that is, men are fighting
and killing down on the river&ndash;&ndash;and they may come here. We
must&ndash;&ndash;I mean, I think it best for us to go away from Simit&iacute;
for a while.&rdquo; The priest&rsquo;s eyes fell before the perplexed gaze
of the girl.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page111' name='book2_page111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go away?&rdquo; she repeated slowly. &ldquo;But, Padre&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers might come&ndash;&ndash;wicked men might come and
harm you, <i>chiquita</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child seemed not to comprehend. &ldquo;Is it that you think
they will, Padre?&rdquo; she at length spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear so, little one,&rdquo; he made reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;why should they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they want to steal and kill,&rdquo; he returned sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t, Padre&ndash;&ndash;they can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the girl said quickly. &ldquo;You
told me that people see only their thoughts, you know. They
only think they want to steal&ndash;&ndash;and they don&rsquo;t think right&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he interrupted bitterly, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t keep them from
coming here just the same and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He checked his words,
as a faint memory of his recent talks with the girl glowed
momentarily in his seething brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can keep them from coming here, Padre&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thinking right ourselves, Padre&ndash;&ndash;you said so, days ago&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo; The girl came to the frightened man
and put her little arm about his neck. It was an action that
had become habitual with her. &ldquo;Padre dear, you read me
something from your Bible just yesterday. It was about God,
and He said, &lsquo;I am that which was, and is, and is to come.&rsquo;
Don&rsquo;t you remember? But, Padre dear, if He is that which is
to come, how can anything bad come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>O, ye of little faith! Could ye not watch one hour with me&ndash;&ndash;the
Christ-principle? Must ye ever flee when the ghost of
evil stalks before you with his gross assumptions?</p>
<p>Yes, Jos&egrave; remembered. But he had said those things to
her and evolved those beautiful theories in a time of peace.
Now his feeble faith was flying in panic before the demon of
unbelief, which had been aroused by sudden fear.</p>
<p>The villagers were gathering before his door like frightened
sheep. They sought counsel, protection, from him, the unfaithful
shepherd. Could he not, for their sakes, tear himself
loose from bondage to his own deeply rooted beliefs, and
launch out into his true orbit about God? Was life, happiness,
all, at the disposal of physical sense? Did he not love these
people? And could not his love for them cast out his fear?
If the test had come, would he meet it, calmly, even alone with
his God, if need be?&ndash;&ndash;or would he basely flee? He was not
alone. Carmen stood by him. She had no part in his cowardice.
But Carmen&ndash;&ndash;she was only a child, immature, inexperienced
in the ways of the world! True. Yet the great God
himself had caused His prophets to see that &ldquo;a little child shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page112' name='book2_page112'></a>112</span>
lead them.&rdquo; And surely Carmen was now leading in fearlessness
and calm trust, in the face of impending evil.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; rose from his chair and threw back his shoulders. He
stepped quickly to the door. &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; he said gently,
holding out his arms over them. &ldquo;Be not afraid. I shall not
leave Simit&iacute;, but remain here to help and protect all who will
stay with me. If the <i>guerrillas</i> or soldiers come we will meet
them here, where we shall be protecting our loved ones and
our homes. Come to the church to-night, and there we will
discuss plans. Go now, and remember that your <i>Cura</i> has said
that there shall no harm befall you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did he believe his own words? He wondered.</p>
<p>The people dispersed; Carmen was called by Do&ntilde;a Maria;
and Jos&egrave; dropped down upon his bed to strive again to clear
his mind of the foul brood which had swept so suddenly into
it, and to prepare for the evening meeting.</p>
<p>Late that night, as he crossed the road from the church to
his little home, his pulse beat rapidly under the stimulus of
real joy. He had conquered his own and the fears of the
Alcalde, and that official had at length promised to stay and
support him. The people&rsquo;s fears of impressment into military
service had been calmly met and assuaged, though Jos&egrave; had
yielded to their wish to form a company of militia; and had
even agreed to drill them, as he had seen the troops of Europe
drilled and prepared for conflict. There were neither guns
nor ammunition in the town, but they could drill with their
<i>machetes</i>&ndash;&ndash;for, he repeated to himself, this was but a concession,
an expedient, to keep the men occupied and their minds
stimulated by his own show of courage and preparedness. It
was decided to send L&aacute;zaro Ortiz at once into the Guamoc&oacute;
district, to find and warn Rosendo; while Juan was to go to
Bodega Central for whatever news he might gather, and to
return with immediate warning, should danger threaten their
town. Similar instruction was to be sent to Escolastico, at
Badillo. Within a few days a runner should be despatched
over the Guamoc&oacute; trail, to spread the information as judiciously
as possible that the people of Simit&iacute; were armed and on the
alert to meet any incursion from <i>guerrilla</i> bands. The ripple
of excitement quickly died away. The priest would now strive
mightily to keep his own thought clear and his courage alive,
to sustain his people in whatever experience might befall
them.</p>
<p>Quiet reigned in the little village the next morning, and its
people went about their familiar duties with but a passing
thought of the events of the preceding day. The Alcalde called
at the parish house early for further instructions in regard to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page113' name='book2_page113'></a>113</span>
the proposed company of militia. The priest decided to drill
his men twice a day, at the rising and setting of the sun. Carmen&rsquo;s
lessons were then resumed, and soon Jos&egrave; was again
laboring conscientiously to imbibe the spirit of calm trust which
dwelt in this young girl.</p>
<p>The Master&rsquo;s keynote before every threatening evil was,
&ldquo;Be not afraid.&rdquo; Carmen&rsquo;s life-motif was, &ldquo;<i>God is everywhere.</i>&rdquo;
Jos&egrave; strove to see that the Christ-principle was eternal, and as
available to mankind now as when the great Exemplar propounded
it to the dull ears of his followers. But men must
learn how to use it. When they have done this, Christianity
will be as scientific and demonstrable to mankind as is now the
science of mathematics. A rule, though understood, is utterly
ineffective if not applied. Yet, how to apply the Christ-principle?
is the question convulsing a world to-day.</p>
<p>God, the infinite creative mind, is that principle. Jesus
showed clearly&ndash;&ndash;so clearly that the wonder is men could have
missed the mark so completely&ndash;&ndash;that the great principle becomes
available only when men empty their minds of pride,
selfishness, ignorance, and human will, and put in their place
love, humility and truth. This step taken, there will flow into
the human consciousness the qualities of God himself, giving
powers that mortals believe utterly impossible to them. But
hatred must go; self-love, too; carnal ambition must go; and
fear&ndash;&ndash;the cornerstone of every towering structure of mortal
misery&ndash;&ndash;must be utterly cast out by an understanding of the
allness of the Mind that framed the spiritual universe.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;, looking at Carmen as she sat before him, tried to know
that love was the salvation, the righteousness, right-thinking,
by which alone the sons of men could be redeemed. The world
would give such utterance the lie, he knew. To love an enemy
is weakness! The sons of earth must be warriors, and valiantly
fight! Alas! the tired old world has fought for ages untold,
and gained&ndash;&ndash;nothing. Did Jesus fight? Not as the world. He
had a better way. He loved his enemies with a love that understood
the allness of God, and the consequent nothingness of
the human concept. Knowing the concept of man as mortal to
be an illusion, Jesus then knew that he had no enemies.</p>
<p>The work-day closed, and Carmen was about to leave. A
shadow fell across the open doorway. Jos&egrave; looked up. A man,
dressed in clerical garb, stood looking in, his eyes fixed upon
Carmen. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart stopped, and he sat as one stunned. The
man was Padre Diego Polo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, brother in Christ!&rdquo; the newcomer cried, advancing
with outstretched hands. &ldquo;Well met, indeed! I ached to think
I might not find you here! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! can this be my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page114' name='book2_page114'></a>114</span>
little Carmen, from whom I tore myself in tears four years ago
and more? <i>Diablo!</i> but she has grown to be a charming <i>se&ntilde;orita</i>
already.&rdquo; He bent over and kissed the child loudly upon
each cheek.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; with difficulty restrained himself from pouncing upon
the man as he watched him pass his fat hands over the girl&rsquo;s
bare arms and feast his lecherous eyes upon her round
figure and plump limbs. The child shrank under the withering
touch. Freeing herself, she ran from the room, followed
by a taunting laugh from Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, sinking into the chair vacated
by the girl. &ldquo;But I had the devil&rsquo;s own trouble getting here!
And I find everything quiet as a funeral in this sink of a
town, just as if hell were not spewing fire down on the river!
<i>Dios!</i> But give me a bit of rum, <i>amigo</i>. My spirits droop like
the torn wing of a heron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; slowly found his voice. &ldquo;I have no rum. I regret exceedingly,
friend. But doubtless the Alcalde can supply you.
Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> With what do you quench your thirst?&rdquo; ejaculated
the disappointed priest. &ldquo;Lake water?&rdquo; Then he added
with a fatuous grin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not yet honored the Alcalde with a call. Anxious
care drove me straight from the boat to you; for with
you, a brother priest, I knew I would find hospitality and
protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sat speechless. After a few moments, during which he
fanned himself vigorously with his black felt hat, Diego continued
volubly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are consumed to know what brings me here, eh? <i>Bien</i>,
I will anticipate your questions. The country is on fire around
Banco. And&ndash;&ndash;you know they do not love priests down that
way&ndash;&ndash;well, I saw that it had come around to my move. I
therefore got out&ndash;&ndash;quickly. H&rsquo;m!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;luckily I had screwed plenty of Masses
out of the Banco sheep this past year, and my treasure box
was comfortably full. <i>Bueno</i>, I hired a canoe and a couple of
strapping <i>peones</i>, who brought me by night, and by damnably
slow degrees, up the river to Bodega Central. As luck would
have it, I chanced to be there the day Juan arrived from Simit&iacute;.
So I straightway caused inquiry to be made of him respecting
the present whereabouts of our esteemed friend, Don Rosendo.
Learning that my worthy brother was prospecting for La
Libertad, it occurred to me that this decaying town might afford
me the asylum I needed until I could make the necessary
preparations to get up into the mountains. <i>Caramba!</i> but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page115' name='book2_page115'></a>115</span>
shall not stay where a stray bullet or a badly directed <i>machete</i>
may terminate my noble life-aspirations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; groaned inwardly. &ldquo;But, how dared you come to
Simit&iacute;?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You were once forced to leave this
town&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; Diego replied with great coolness. &ldquo;And
I would not risk my tender skin again had I not believed that
you were here to shield me. My only safety lies in making the
mountains. Their most accessible point is by way of Simit&iacute;.
From here I can go to the San Lucas country; eventually get
back to the Guamoc&oacute; trail; and ultimately land in Remedios,
or some other town farther south, where the anticlerical sentiment
is not so cursedly strong. I have money and two negro
boys. The boat I shall have to leave here in your care. <i>Bien</i>,
learning that Rosendo, my principal annoyance and obstruction,
was absent, and that you, my friend, were here, I decided
to brave the wrath of the simple denizens of this hole, and
spend a day or two as guest of yourself and my good friend,
the Alcalde, before journeying farther. Thus you have it all,
in <i>parvo</i>. But, <i>Dios y diablo</i>! that trip up the river has nearly
done for me! We traveled by night and hid in the brush by
day, where millions of gnats and mosquitoes literally devoured
me! <i>Caramba!</i> and you so inhospitable as to have no rum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The garrulous priest paused for breath. Then he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A voluptuous little wench, that Carmen! Keeping her
for yourself, eh? But you will have to give her up. Belongs to
the Church, you know. But don&rsquo;t let our worthy Don Wenceslas
hear of her good looks, for he&rsquo;d pop her into a convent
<i>presto</i>! And later he&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, you had better get rid of her before
she makes you trouble. I&rsquo;ll take her off your hands myself,
even though I shall be traveling for the next few months.
But, say,&rdquo; changing the subject abruptly, &ldquo;Don Wenceslas
sprung his trap too soon, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, consuming with indignation
over the priest&rsquo;s coarse talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i> he pulls a revolution before it is ripe. Is anything
more absurd! It begins as he intended, anticlerical; and so
it will run for a while. But after that&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, you will see it reverse
itself and turn solely political, with the present Government
on top at the last, and the end a matter of less than six
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;, eagerly grasping at a new
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; ejaculated Diego. &ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> But I have been
too close to matters religious and political in this country all
my life not to know that Don Wenceslas has this time committed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page116' name='book2_page116'></a>116</span>
the blunder of being a bit too eager. Had he waited a
few months longer, and then pulled the string&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios y diablo</i>!
there would have been such a fracas as to turn the Cordilleras
bottom up! Now all that is set back for years&ndash;&ndash;<i>Quien sabe</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; queried the puzzled Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;how could Wenceslas, a
priest, profit by an anticlerical war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba, amigo!</i> But the good Wenceslas is priest only
in name! He is a politician, bred to the game. He lays his
plans with the anticlericals, knowing full well that Church and
State can not be separated in this land of mutton-headed
<i>peones</i>. <i>Bueno</i>, the clever man precipitates a revolution that
can have but one result, the closer union of Rome and the Colombian
Government. And for this he receives the direction of
the See of Cartagena and the disposition of the rich revenues
from the mines and <i>fincas</i> of his diocese. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, <i>amigo</i>, how long will this disturbance continue?&rdquo;
said Jos&egrave;, speaking earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you, a few weeks at the most,&rdquo; replied Diego
with a show of petulance. &ldquo;But, just the same, as agent of
your friend Wenceslas, I have been a mite too active along the
river, especially in the town of Banco, to find safety anywhere
within the pale of civilization until this little fracas blows over.
This one being an abortion, the next revolution can come only
after several years of most painstaking preparation. But, mark
me, <i>amigo</i>, that one will not miscarry, nor will it be less than a
scourge of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the sordidness of the man, Jos&egrave; was profoundly
grateful to him for this information. And there could be no
doubt of its authenticity, coming as it did from a tool of Wenceslas
himself. Jos&egrave; became cheerful, even animated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, then! Now when do you expect to set out for San
Lucas?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Rosendo may return any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i> Then I must be off at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; suggested Jos&egrave; eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba, hermano!</i> Why so desirous of my departure?
To be sure, to-morrow, if possible. But I must have a chat with
our good friend, the Alcalde. So do me the inexpressible favor
to accompany me to his door, and there leave me. My <i>peones</i>
are down at the boat, and I would rather not face the people of
Simit&iacute; alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>The man rose to depart. At that moment Do&ntilde;a Maria appeared
at the door bearing a tray with Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s supper. She
stopped short as she recognized Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>Se&ntilde;ora Do&ntilde;a Maria</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Diego, bowing low.
&ldquo;I kiss your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page117' name='book2_page117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>The woman looked inquiringly from Diego to Jos&egrave;. Without
a word she set the tray on the table and quickly departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, <i>amigo</i>, I think it well to visit the Alcalde at once,&rdquo;
murmured Diego. &ldquo;I regret that I bring the amiable se&ntilde;ora no
greeting from her charming daughter. <i>Ay de m&iacute;!</i>&rdquo; he sighed,
picking up his hat. &ldquo;The conventions of this world are so
narrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario exclaimed loudly when he beheld the familiar
figure of Padre Diego. Recovering from his astonishment he
broke into a loud guffaw and clapped the grinning priest
heartily upon the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, man! But I admire you at last! I can forgive
all your wickedness at sight of such nerve! Ramona!&rdquo; calling
to his daughter in the <i>patio</i>. &ldquo;That last <i>garraf&oacute;n</i> and some
glasses! But enter, enter, se&ntilde;ores! Why stand you there?
My poor hovel is yours!&rdquo; stepping aside and ceremoniously
waving them in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend finds that his supper awaits him,&rdquo; said Diego,
laying a hand patronizingly upon Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;But I will eat
with you, my good Don Mario, and occupy a <i>petate</i> on your
floor to-night. <i>Conque</i>, until later, Don Jos&egrave;,&rdquo; waving a polite
dismissal to the latter. &ldquo;If not to-night, then in the morning
<i>temprano</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audacity of the man nettled Jos&egrave;. He would have liked
to be present during the interview between the Alcalde and this
cunning religio-political agent, for he knew that the weak-kneed
Don Mario would be putty in his oily hands. However,
Diego had shown him that he was not wanted. And there was
nothing to do but nurse his temper and await events.</p>
<p>But, whatever deplorable results the visit of Diego might
entail, he had at least brought present comfort to Jos&egrave; in his
report of the militant uprising now in progress, and the latter
would sleep this night without the torment of dread apprehension.</p>
<p>The next morning Diego entered the parish house just as
master and pupil were beginning their day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;our parochial school is quite discriminating!
No? One pupil! <i>Bien</i>, are there not enough children
in the town to warrant a larger school, and with a Sister in
charge? I will report the matter to the good Bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s wrath leaped into flame. &ldquo;There is a school here, as
you know, <i>amigo</i>, with a competent master,&rdquo; he replied with
what calmness he could muster.</p>
<p>It was perhaps a hasty and unfortunate remark, for Jos&egrave;
knew he had been jealously selfish with Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, yes!&rdquo; retorted Diego. &ldquo;A private school, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page118' name='book2_page118'></a>118</span>
which the stubborn beasts that live in this sink will not send
their brats! There must be a parochial school in Simit&iacute;, supported
by the people! Oh, don&rsquo;t worry; there is gold enough
here, buried in <i>patios</i> and under these innocent-looking mud
walls, to support the Pope for a decade&ndash;&ndash;and that,&rdquo; he
chuckled, &ldquo;is no small sum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes roved over Carmen and he began a mental appraisement
of the girl. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; muttering half to himself,
after he had feasted his sight upon her for some moments, &ldquo;but
she is large for her age&ndash;&ndash;and, <i>Dios y diablo!</i> a ravishing
beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a while wrapped in thought. Then an idea
seemed to filter through his cunning brain. His coarse, unmoral
face brightened, and his thick lips parted in an evil smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little one,&rdquo; he said patronizingly, extending his
arms to the child. &ldquo;Come, give your good <i>Padre</i> his morning
kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shrank back in her chair and looked appealingly at
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Then I must come and steal it; and when you confess
to good Padre Jos&egrave; you may tell him it was all my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started toward her. A look of horror came into the
child&rsquo;s face and she sprang from her seat. Jos&egrave; swiftly rose.
He seized Diego by the shoulder and whirled him quickly
about. His face was menacing and his frame trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, friend!&rdquo; The voice was low, tense, and deliberate.
&ldquo;If you lay a hand on that child I will strike you
dead at my feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego recoiled. <i>Cielo!</i> was this the timid sheep that had
stopped for a moment in Banco on its way to the slaughter?
But there was no mistaking the spirit manifested now in that
voice and attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>amigo</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a foolish grin splitting his
ugly features. &ldquo;Your little joke startled me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; motioned Carmen to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, Don Diego. It would be well to understand
each other more thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Jos&egrave; gone too far? He wondered. Heaven knew, he
could not afford to make enemies, especially at this juncture!
But he had not misread the thought coursing through the foul
mind of Diego. And yet, violence now might ruin both the
child and himself. He must be wiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I was perhaps a little hasty, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; he began in gentler
tones. &ldquo;But, as you see, I have been quite wrought up of late&ndash;&ndash;the
news of the revolution, and&ndash;&ndash;in these past months there
have been many things to cause me worry. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page119' name='book2_page119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more, good friend,&rdquo; interrupted the oily Diego, his
beady eyes twinkling. &ldquo;But you will not wonder it struck me
odd that a father should not be permitted to embrace his own
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dead silence, heavy and stifling, fell upon Jos&egrave;. Slowly his
throat filled, and his ears began to throb. Diego sat before him,
smiling and twirling his fat thumbs. He looked like the images
of Chinese gods Jos&egrave; had seen in foreign lands.</p>
<p>Then the tortured man forced a laugh. Of course, the
strain of yesterday had been too much for him! His overwrought
mind had read into words and events meanings which
they had not been meant to convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; he managed to say, striving to steady his
voice. &ldquo;But we spiritual Fathers should not forget&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego laughed egregiously. &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, man! Let us get
to the meat in the nut. Why do you think I am in Simit&iacute;,
braving the wrath of Rosendo and others? Why have I left
my comfortable quarters in Banco, to undertake a journey,
long and hazardous, to this godless hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, apparently enjoying the suffering he saw depicted
upon Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;But you will keep my confidence,
no? We are brother priests, and must hold together.
You protect me in this, and I return the favor in a like indiscretion.
<i>Bien</i>, I explain: I am here partly because of the revolution,
as I told you yesterday, and partly, as I did not tell you,
to see my little girl, my daughter, Carmen&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, man!&rdquo; he cried, bounding to his feet, as he
saw Jos&egrave; slowly rise before him. &ldquo;Listen! It is God&rsquo;s truth!
Sit down! Sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; dropped back into his chair like a withered leaf in the
lull of a winter&rsquo;s wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios y diablo</i>, but it rends me to make this confession,
<i>amigo</i>! And yet, I look to you for support! The girl, Carmen&ndash;&ndash;<i>I am her father!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego paced dramatically up and down before the scarce
hearing Jos&egrave; and unfolded his story in a quick, jerky voice,
with many a gesture and much rolling of his bright eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother was a Spanish woman of high degree. We
met in Bogot&aacute;. My vows prevented me from marrying her, else
I should have done so. <i>Caramba</i>, but I loved her! <i>Bien</i>, I
was called to Cartagena. She feared, in her delicate state, that
I was deserting her. She tried to follow me, and at Badillo
was put off the boat. There, poor child, she passed away in
grief, leaving her babe. May she rest forever on the bosom
of the blessed Virgin!&rdquo; Diego bowed reverently and crossed
himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page120' name='book2_page120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I lost all trace of her. My diligent inquiries revealed
nothing. Two years later I was assigned to the parish
of Simit&iacute;. Here I saw the little locket which I had given her,
and knew that Carmen was my child. Ah, <i>Dios!</i> what a revelation
to a breaking heart! But I could not openly acknowledge
her, for I was already in disgrace, as you know. And, once
down, it is easy to sink still further. I confess, I was indiscreet
here. I was forced to fly. Rosendo&rsquo;s daughter followed
me, despite my protests. I was assigned to Banco. <i>Bien</i>, time
passed, and you came. I had hoped you would take the little
Carmen under your protection. God, how I grieved for the
child! At last I determined, come what might, to see her. The
revolution drove me to the mountains; and love for my girl
brought me by way of Simit&iacute;. And now, <i>amigo</i>, you have my
confession&ndash;&ndash;and you will not be hard on me? <i>Caramba</i>, I need
a friend!&rdquo; He sat down, and mopped his wet brow. His talk
had shaken him visibly.</p>
<p>Again oppressive silence. Jos&egrave; was staring with unseeing
eyes out through the open doorway. A stream of sunlight
poured over the dusty threshold, and myriad motes danced in
the golden flood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, amigo</i>,&rdquo; Diego resumed, with more confidence. &ldquo;I
had not thought to reveal this, my secret, to you&ndash;&ndash;nor to any
one, for that matter&ndash;&ndash;but just to get a peep at my little daughter,
and assure my anxious heart of her welfare. But since
coming here and seeing how mature she is my plans have
taken more definite shape. I shall leave at daybreak to-morrow,
if Don Mario can have my supplies ready on this short notice,
and&ndash;&ndash;will take Carmen with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; struggled wearily to his feet. The color had left his
face, and ages seemed to bestride his bent shoulders. His voice
quavered as he slowly spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me now, Don Diego. It were better that we should
not meet again until you depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>amigo</i>&ndash;&ndash;ah, I feel for you, believe me! You are attached
to the child&ndash;&ndash;who would not be? <i>Caramba</i>, what is this
world but a cemetery of bleaching hopes! But&ndash;&ndash;how can I
ask it? <i>Amigo</i>, send the child to me at the house of the
Alcalde. I would hold her in my arms and feel a father&rsquo;s joy.
And bid the good Do&ntilde;a Maria make her ready for to-morrow&rsquo;s
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned to the man. An ominous calm now possessed
him. &ldquo;You said&ndash;&ndash;the San Lucas district?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> good friend,&rdquo; Diego made hasty reply. &ldquo;My
plans seem quite altered since coming here. <i>Bien</i>, we must
see. But I will leave you now. And you will send Carmen to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page121' name='book2_page121'></a>121</span>
me at once? And bid her bring her mother&rsquo;s locket. <i>Conque,
hasta luego, amigo.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the door, and seeing his two negro <i>peones</i> loitering
near, walked confidently and briskly to the house of Don
Mario.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;, bewildered and benumbed, staggered into his sleeping
room and sank upon the bed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;Padre dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen stood beside the stricken priest, and her little hand
crept into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched until I saw him go, and then I came in. He has
bad thoughts, hasn&rsquo;t he? But&ndash;&ndash;Padre dear, what is it? Did
he make you think bad thoughts, too? He can&rsquo;t, you know, if
you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent over him and laid her cheek against his. Jos&egrave;
stared unseeing up at the thatch roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, everything has a rule, a principle, you told
me. Don&rsquo;t you remember? But his thoughts haven&rsquo;t any
principle, have they? Any more than the mistakes I make in
algebra. Aren&rsquo;t we glad we know that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child kissed the suffering man and wound her arms
about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, he couldn&rsquo;t say anything that could make
you unhappy&ndash;&ndash;he just couldn&rsquo;t! God is <i>everywhere</i>, and you
are His child&ndash;&ndash;and I am, too&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and there just isn&rsquo;t anything
here but God, and we are in Him. Why, Padre, we are
in Him, just like the little fish in the lake! Isn&rsquo;t it nice to
know that&ndash;&ndash;to really <i>know</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aye, if he had really known it he would not now be
stretched upon a bed of torment. Yet, Carmen knew it. And
his suffering was for her. Was he not really yielding to the
mesmerism of human events? Why, oh, why could he not
remain superior to them? Why continually rise and fall,
tossed through his brief years like a dry weed in the blast?</p>
<p>It was because he <i>would</i> know evil, and yield to its mesmerism.
His enemies were not without, but within. How
could he hope to be free until he had passed from self-consciousness
to the sole consciousness of infinite good?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, his bad thoughts have only the minus sign,
haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, and Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s now carried the same symbol of nothingness.
Carmen was linked to the omnipresent mind that is God; and
no power, be it Diego or his superior, Wenceslas, could effect
a separation.</p>
<p>But if Carmen was Diego&rsquo;s child, she must go with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page122' name='book2_page122'></a>122</span>
Jos&egrave; could no longer endure this torturing thought. He rose
from the bed and sought Do&ntilde;a Maria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;tell me again what you know of
Carmen&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good woman was surprised at the question, but could
add nothing to what Rosendo had already told him. He asked
to see again the locket. Alas! study it as he might, the portrait
of the man was wholly indistinguishable. The sweet, sad face
of the young mother looked out from its frame like a suffering.
Magdalen. In it he thought he saw a resemblance to Carmen.
As for Diego, the child certainly did not resemble him in the
least. But years of dissipation and evil doubtless had wrought
their changes in his features.</p>
<p>He looked around for Carmen. She had disappeared. He
rose and searched through the house for her. Do&ntilde;a Maria,
busy in the kitchen, had not seen her leave. His search futile,
he returned with heavy heart to his own house and sat down
to think. Mechanically he opened his Bible.</p>
<p><i>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee.</i>
Not &ldquo;if,&rdquo; but &ldquo;when.&rdquo; The sharp experiences of human existence
are not to be avoided. But in their very midst the
Christ-principle is available to the faithful searcher and
worker.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria came with the midday meal. Carmen had not
returned. Jos&egrave;, alarmed beyond measure, prepared to set out
in search of her. But at that moment one of Diego&rsquo;s <i>peones</i>
appeared at the door with his master&rsquo;s request that the child
be sent at once to him. At least, then, she was not in his
hands; and Jos&egrave; breathed more freely. It seemed to him that,
should he see her in Diego&rsquo;s arms, he must certainly strangle
him. He shuddered at the thought. Only a few minutes before
he had threatened to kill him!</p>
<p>He left his food untasted. Unspeakably wearied with his
incessant mental battle, he threw himself again upon his bed,
and at length sank into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The shadows were gathering when he awoke with a start.
He heard a call from the street. Leaping from the bed, he
hastened to the door, just as Rosendo, swaying beneath his
pack, and accompanied by L&aacute;zaro Ortiz, rounded the corner
and made toward him.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hola, amigo Cura!&rdquo;</i> Rosendo shouted, his face radiant.
&ldquo;Come and bid me welcome, and receive good news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same moment Carmen came flying toward them from
the direction of the shales. Jos&egrave; instantly divined the motive
which had sent her out there. He turned his face to hide the
tears which sprang to his eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page123' name='book2_page123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he murmured in a choking voice. Then he
hastened to his faithful ally and clasped him in his arms.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>
</div>
<p>Struggling vainly with his agitation, while the good tidings
which he could no longer hold fairly bubbled from
his lips, Rosendo dragged the priest into the parish house
and made fast the doors. Swinging his chair to the floor, he
hastily unstrapped his kit and extracted a canvas bag, which
he handed to Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he exclaimed in a loud whisper, &ldquo;we have found
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; the bewildered Jos&egrave; managed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, Padre&ndash;&ndash;gold! Look, the bag is full! <i>Hombre!</i> not
less than forty <i>pesos oro</i>&ndash;&ndash;and more up there&ndash;&ndash;quien sabe how
much! <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo fell into a chair, panting with excitement. Jos&egrave;
sat down with quickening pulse and waited for the full story.
It was not long coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;I knew we would find it&ndash;&ndash;but not this way! <i>Hombre!</i>
It was back of Popales. I had been washing the sands
there for two days after my return. There was a town at that
place, years ago. The stone foundations of the houses can
still be seen. The Tigu&iacute; was rich at that point then; but it is
washed out now. <i>Bien</i>, one morning I started out at daybreak
to prospect Popales creek, the little stream cutting back into
the hills behind the old settlement. There was a heavy mist
over the whole valley, and I could not see ten feet before my
face. <i>Bien</i>, I had gone up-stream a long distance, perhaps
several miles, without finding more than a few colors, when
suddenly the mist began to clear, and there before me, only a
few feet away, stood a young deer, just as dumfounded as
I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment for breath, laughing meanwhile at the
memory of his surprise. Then he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, fresh venison looked good to me, Padre, living on
salt <i>bagre</i> and beans. But I had no weapon, save my <i>machete</i>.
So I let drive with that, and with all my strength. The big
knife struck the deer on a leg. The animal turned and started
swiftly up the mountain side, with myself in pursuit. <i>Caramba</i>,
that was a climb! But with his belly chasing him, a hungry
man will climb anything! Through palms and ferns and high
weeds, falling over rocks and tripping on ground vines we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page124' name='book2_page124'></a>124</span>
went, clear to the top of the hill. Then the animal turned and
plunged down a glen. On the descent it traveled faster, and in
a few minutes had passed clean from my sight. <i>Caramba</i>, I
was angry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to laugh again at the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The glen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;ran down for perhaps a hundred
yards, and then widened into a clearing. I have been in the
Popales country many times, Padre, but I had never been to
the top of this mountain, nor had I ever seen this glen, which
seemed to be an ancient trail. So I went on down toward the
clearing. As I approached it I crossed what apparently was
the bed of an ancient stream, dry now, but with many pools
of water from the recent rains, which are very heavy in that
region. <i>Bien</i>, I turned and followed this dry bed for a long
distance, and at last came out into the open. I found myself
in a circular space, surrounded by high hills, with no opening
but the stream bed along which I had come. At the far end of
the basin-shaped clearing the creek bed stopped abruptly; and
I then knew that the water had formerly come over the cliff
above in a high waterfall, but had flowed in a direction opposite
to that of Popales creek, this mountain being the divide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>; now for my discovery! I several times filled my
<i>batea</i> with gravel from the dry bed and washed it in one of the
pools. I got only a few scattered colors. But as I dug along
the margin of the bed I noticed what seemed to be pieces of
adobe bricks. I went on up one side of the bowl-shaped glen,
and found many such pieces, and in some places stones that
had served as foundations for houses at one time. So I knew
that there had been a town there, long, long ago. But it must
have been an Indian village, for had it been known to the
Spaniards I surely would have learned of it from my parents.
The ground higher up was strewn with the broken bricks. I
picked up many of the pieces and examined them. Almost
every one showed a color or two of gold; but not enough to
pay washing the clay from which they had been made. But&ndash;&ndash;and
here is the end of my story&ndash;&ndash;I have said that this open
space was shaped like a bowl, with all sides dipping sharply
to the center. It occurred to me that in the years&ndash;&ndash;who knows
how many?&ndash;&ndash;that have passed since this town was abandoned,
the heavy rains that had dissolved the mud bricks also must
have washed the mud and the gold it carried down into the
center of this basin, where, with great quantities of water
sweeping over it every rainy season, the clay and sand would
gradually wash out, leaving the gold concentrated in the
center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stopped to light the thick cigar which he had
rolled during his recital.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page125' name='book2_page125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> Padre, it was a lucky thought! I located the
center of the big bowl as nearly as possible, and began to dig.
I washed some of the dirt taken a foot or two below the surface.
Hombre! it left a string of gold clear around the <i>batea</i>!
I became so excited I could scarcely dig. Every batea, as I got
deeper and deeper, yielded more and more gold! I hurried
back to the Tigu&iacute; for my supplies; and then camped up there
and washed the sand and clay for two weeks, until I had to
come back to Simit&iacute; for food. Forty <i>pesos oro</i> in fifteen days!
<i>Caramba!</i> And there is more. And all concentrated from the
mud bricks of that old, forgotten town in the mountains, miles
back of Popales! May the Virgin bless that deer and mend
its hurt leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hundred and sixty francs in shining gold flakes! And
who knew how much more to be had for the digging!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Padre,&rdquo; mused Rosendo, &ldquo;it is wonderful how things
turn out&ndash;&ndash;that is, when, as the little Carmen says, you think
right! I thought I&rsquo;d find it&ndash;&ndash;I knew it was right! And here
it is! <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of Carmen&rsquo;s name Jos&egrave; again became
troubled. Rosendo as yet did not know of Diego&rsquo;s presence in
Simit&iacute;. Should he tell him? It might lead to murder. Rosendo
would learn of it soon enough; and Jos&egrave; dared not cast
a blight upon the happiness of this rare moment. He would
wait.</p>
<p>As they sat reunited at the supper table in Rosendo&rsquo;s house,
a constant stream of townspeople passed and repassed the
door, some stopping to greet the returned prospector, others
lingering to witness Rosendo&rsquo;s conduct when he should learn
of Diego&rsquo;s presence in the town, although no one would tell
him of it. The atmosphere was tense with suppressed excitement,
and Jos&egrave; trembled with dread. Do&ntilde;a Maria moved
quietly about, giving no hint of the secret she carried. Carmen
laughed and chatted, but did not again mention the man from
whose presence she had fled to the shales that morning. Who
could doubt that in the midst of the prevalent mental confusion
she had gone out there &ldquo;<i>to think</i>&rdquo;? And having performed
that duty, she had, as usual, left her problem with her immanent
God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go up and settle with Don Mario this very night,&rdquo;
Rosendo abruptly announced, as they rose from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, friend!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; quickly. &ldquo;L&aacute;zaro has told you
of the revolution; and we have many plans to consider, now
that we have found gold. Come with me to the shales. We
will not be interrupted there. We can slip out through the
rear door, and so avoid these curious people. I have much to
discuss with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page126' name='book2_page126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Rosendo chuckled. &ldquo;My honest debts first, <i>buen Cura</i>,&rdquo;
he said sturdily. And throwing back his shoulders he strutted
about the room with the air of a plutocrat. With his bare
feet, his soiled, flapping attire, and his swelling sense of self-importance
he cut a comical figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Jos&egrave; was at his wits&rsquo; end. Then a happy
thought struck him. &ldquo;Why, man! I want to make you captain
of the militia we are forming, and I must talk with you alone
first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The childish egotism of the old man was instantly touched.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Capit&aacute;n! el capit&aacute;n!&rdquo;</i> he cried in glee. He slapped his
chest and strode proudly around the room. &ldquo;<i>Caramba! Capit&aacute;n
Don Rosendo Ariza, S!</i> Ha! Shall I carry a sword and wear
gold braid?&ndash;&ndash;But these fellows are mighty curious,&rdquo; he muttered,
looking out through the door at the loitering townsfolk.
&ldquo;The shales, then, Padre! Close the front door, Carmencita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; scarcely breathed until, skirting the shore of the lake
and making a detour of the town, he and Rosendo at length
reached the shale beds unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, the gold deposit that you have discovered&ndash;&ndash;is it
safe? Could others find it?&rdquo; queried Jos&egrave; at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Padre! No trail leads to it. And no one would
think of looking there for gold. I discovered it by the merest
chance, and I left no trace of my presence. Besides, there are
no gold hunters in that country, and very few people in the
entire district of Guamoc&oacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long will it take you to wash out the deposit, do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> Padre. A year&ndash;&ndash;two years&ndash;&ndash;perhaps longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot return to Guamoc&oacute; until the revolution is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, I will remain in Simit&iacute; a week or two. We
may then know what to expect of the revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what? <i>Caramba</i>, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sighed. No one seemed to fear but himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, about the gold for Cartagena: how can we send
it, even when peace is restored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan might go down each month,&rdquo; Rosendo suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! The expense would be greater than the
amount shipped. And it would not be safe. Besides, our work
must be done with the utmost secrecy. No one but ourselves
must know of your discovery. And no one else in Simit&iacute; must
know where we are sending the gold. Rosendo, it is a great
problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page127' name='book2_page127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>The men lapsed into profound meditation. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, the little Carmen makes great progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Por supuesto!</i> I knew she would. She has a mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no idea, Rosendo, who her parents might have
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you, Rosendo, that, because of her
deeply religious nature, possibly her father was a priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba, no!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Rosendo, turning upon Jos&egrave;.
&ldquo;What puts that into your head, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have said, Rosendo,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; answered, &ldquo;her religious
instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, you forget that priests are not religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some are, Rosendo,&rdquo; persisted Jos&egrave; in a tone of protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But those who are do not have children,&rdquo; was
Rosendo&rsquo;s simple manner of settling the argument.</p>
<p>Its force appealed to Jos&egrave;, and he felt a shade of relief. But,
if Diego were not the father of Carmen, what motive had he
for wishing to take her with him, other than to train her
eventually to become his concubine? The thought maddened
him. He almost decided to tell Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, we came out here to talk about the militia of
which I am to be captain. <i>Bien</i>, we must begin work to-morrow.
<i>Hombre</i>, but the se&ntilde;ora&rsquo;s eyes will stand out when
she sees me marching at the head of the company!&rdquo; He
laughed like a pleased child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that we have gold, Padre, I must send to Cartagena
for a gun. What would one cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably could not obtain one, Rosendo. The Government
is so afraid of revolutions that it prohibits the importation
of arms. But even if you could, it would cost not
less than fifty <i>pesos oro</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty <i>pesos</i>! <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the artless fellow.
&ldquo;Then I get no gun! But now let us name those who will
form the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By dwelling on the pleasing theme, Jos&egrave; managed to keep
Rosendo engaged until fatigue at length drove the old man
to seek his bed. The town was wrapped in darkness as they
passed through its quiet streets, and the ancient Spanish
lantern, hanging crazily from its moldering sconce on the
corner of Don Felipe&rsquo;s house, threw the only light into the
black mantle that lay upon the main thoroughfare.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At sunrise, Jos&egrave; was awakened by Rosendo noisily entering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page128' name='book2_page128'></a>128</span>
his house. A glance at the old man showed that he was laboring
under strong emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of friendship is this,&rdquo; he demanded curtly, &ldquo;that
you keep me from learning of Diego&rsquo;s presence in Simit&iacute;? It
was a trick you served me&ndash;&ndash;and friends do not so to one another!&rdquo;
He stood looking darkly at the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him, then? Good heavens, Rosendo! what
have you done to him?&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, hastily leaving his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, comfort yourself, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, a sneer
curling his lips. &ldquo;Your friend is safe&ndash;&ndash;for the present. He
and his negro rascals fled before sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which direction did they take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask? Would you go to them? <i>Bueno</i>, then
across the lake, toward the Juncal. Don Mario stocked their
boat last night, while you kept me out on the shales. <i>Buen
arreglo, no?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; gladly, &ldquo;an excellent arrangement
to keep you from dipping your hands in his foul blood.
Why, man! is your vision so short? Have you no thought of
Carmen and her future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios</i>! he has spread the report that he is her father!
<i>Caramba!</i> For that I would tear him apart! He robbed me of
one child; and now&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! Why did you let him go?&ndash;&ndash;why
did you, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo paced the floor like a caged lion, while great tears
rolled down his black cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo, if you had killed him&ndash;&ndash;what then? Imprisonment
for you, suffering for us all, and the complete
wreck of our hopes. Is it worth it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, but I would have escaped to Guamoc&oacute;, to the
gold I have discovered. There no one would have found me.
And you would have kept me supplied; and I would have given
you the gold I washed to care for her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sank into a chair and buried his head in his hands.
&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;But he will return when I am gone&ndash;&ndash;and
the Church is back of him, and they will come and
steal her away&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How childish, and yet how great he was in his wonderful
love, thought Jos&egrave;. He pitied him from the bottom of his
heart; he loved him immeasurably; yet he knew the old man&rsquo;s
judgment was unsound in this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Rosendo,&rdquo; he said gently, laying a hand upon the
bent head. &ldquo;This is a time when expediency bids us suffer
an evil to remain for a little while, that a much greater good
may follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. Then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;You do not think Diego is her
father?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page129' name='book2_page129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand devils, no!&rdquo; shouted Rosendo, springing up.
&ldquo;He the father of that angel-child? <i>Cielo!</i> His brats would
be serpents! But I am losing time&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He turned to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo!&rdquo; cried the priest in fresh alarm. &ldquo;Where are
you going? What are you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going after Diego! Juan and L&aacute;zaro go with me!
Before sundown that devil&rsquo;s carcass will be buzzard meat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; threw himself in front of Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, think of Carmen! Would you kill her, too? If
you kill Diego nothing can save her from Wenceslas! Rosendo,
for God&rsquo;s sake, listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old man, with his huge strength, tossed the frail
priest lightly aside and rushed into the street. Blind with
rage, he did not see Carmen standing a short distance from the
door. The child had been sent to summon him to breakfast.
Unable to check his momentum, the big man crashed full into
her and bore her to the ground beneath him. As she fell her
head struck the sharp edge of an ancient paving stone, and
she lay quite still, while the warm blood slowly trickled through
her long curls.</p>
<p>Uttering a frightened cry, Jos&egrave; rushed to the dazed Rosendo
and got him to his feet. Then he picked up the child,
and, his heart numb with fear, bore her into the house.</p>
<p>Clasping Carmen fiercely in his arms, Jos&egrave; tried to aid Do&ntilde;a
Maria in staunching the freely flowing blood. Rosendo, crazed
with grief, bent over them, giving vent to moans which, despite
his own fears, wrung the priest&rsquo;s heart with pity for the
suffering old man. At length the child opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praise God!&rdquo; cried Rosendo, kneeling and showering kisses
upon her hands. <i>&ldquo;Loado sea el buen Dios! Caramba! Caramba!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo,&rdquo; the girl murmured, smiling down at him,
&ldquo;your thoughts were driving you, just like Benjam&iacute;n drives his
oxen. And they were bad, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have knocked me
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; Rosendo went to the doorway and squatted down
upon the dirt floor in the sunlight. &ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, but they were murder-thoughts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they tried to make you murder me, didn&rsquo;t they, padre
dear?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t really happen, anyway,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>Rosendo buried his head in his hands and groaned aloud.
Carmen slipped down from Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s lap and went unsteadily to
the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not yours, those thoughts, padre dear,&rdquo; putting
her arms around his neck. &ldquo;But they were whipping you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page130' name='book2_page130'></a>130</span>
hard, just as if you belonged to them. And see, it just shows
that bad thoughts can&rsquo;t do anything. Look, I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo;
She stood off and smiled at him.</p>
<p>Rosendo reached out and clasped her in his long arms.
&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if you were not, your old padre Rosendo
would throw himself into the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More bad thoughts, padre dear!&rdquo; She laughed and held
up a warning finger. &ldquo;But I was to tell you the <i>desayuno</i> was
ready; and see, we have forgotten all about it!&rdquo; Her merry
laugh rang through the room like a silver bell.</p>
<p>After breakfast Jos&egrave; took Rosendo, still shaking, into the
parish house. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that we have learned
another lesson, have we not, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s head sank upon his great chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if we are wise, we will profit by it&ndash;&ndash;will we not,
<i>compadre</i>?&rdquo; He waited a moment, then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been seeing in a dim way, <i>amigo</i>, that our thought
is always the vital thing to be reckoned with, more than we
have even suspected before. I believe there is a mental law,
though I cannot formulate it, that in some way the thoughts
we hold use us, and become externalized in actions. You were
wild with fear for Carmen, and your thoughts of Diego were
murderous. Bien, they almost drove you to murder, and they
reacted upon the very one you most love. Can you not see it,
<i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo looked up. His face was drawn. &ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;I am
almost afraid to think of anything&ndash;&ndash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; with deep compassion, &ldquo;I, too, have
had a deep lesson in thinking these past two days. I had
evolved many beautiful theories, and worked out wonderful
plans during these weeks of peace. Then suddenly came the
news of the revolution, and, presto! they all flew to pieces!
But Carmen&ndash;&ndash;nothing disturbs her. Is it because she is too
young to fear? I think not, <i>amigo</i>, I think not. I think, rather,
that it is because she is too wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;she is not of the earth, Padre.&rdquo; The old man shook
his head dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, she is! She is human, just as we are. But in
some way she has learned a great truth, and that is that wrong
thinking brings all the discord and woe that afflict the human
race. We know this is true, you and I. In a way we have
known it all our lives. But why, <i>why</i> do we not practice it?
Why do I yield so readily to fear; and you to revenge? I
rather think if we loved our enemies we would have none, for
our only enemies are the thoughts that become externalized in
wrong thought-concepts. And even this externalization is only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page131' name='book2_page131'></a>131</span>
in our own consciousness. It is there, and only there, that
we see evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his
head. &ldquo;We know so little&ndash;&ndash;so little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo, we know enough to try to be like Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, yes! And I try to be like her. But whenever
danger threatens her, the very devils seize me, and I am no
longer myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I know. But will not her God protect her? Can
not we trust her to Him?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; spoke with the conviction of
right, however inconsistent his past conduct might have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Padre&ndash;&ndash;and I must try to love Diego&ndash;&ndash;I know&ndash;&ndash;though
I hate him as the devil hates the cross! Carmen would
say that he was used by bad thoughts, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. She would not see the man, but the impersonal
thought that seems to use him. And I believe she knows how
to meet that kind of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Padre. <i>Bien</i>, I must try to love him. I <i>will</i>
try. And&ndash;&ndash;Padre, whenever he comes into my mind I will try
to think of him as God&rsquo;s child&ndash;&ndash;though I know he isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; laughed loudly at this. &ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You must not think of the human Diego as God&rsquo;s child! You
must always think of the <i>real</i> child of God for which this
human concept, Diego, stands in your consciousness. Do you
understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre. But perhaps I can learn. I will try. But
Diego shall live. And&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, now let us talk about the company
of militia. But here comes the Alcalde. <i>Caramba!</i> what
does he want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With much oily ceremony and show of affection, Don Mario
greeted the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bring a message from Padre Diego,&rdquo; he announced pompously,
after the exchange of courtesies. &ldquo;Bien, it is quite unfortunate
that our friend Rosendo feels so hard toward him,
especially as Don Diego has so long entrusted Carmen to Rosendo&rsquo;s
care. But&ndash;&ndash;his letter, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; placing a folded
paper in Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Silently, but with swelling indignation, Jos&egrave; read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Brother in Christ: It is, as you must know, because of our
good Rosendo&rsquo;s foolish anger that I relieve him of the embarrassment
of my presence in Simit&iacute;. Not that I fear bodily harm, but lest his
thoughtlessness urge him to attempt injury upon me; in which case nothing
but unhappiness could result, as my two negro servants would protect
me with their own lives. I rather choose peace, and to that end
quietly depart. But I leave behind my bleeding heart in the little Carmen;
and I beg that you will at once hand her over to the excellent
Don Mario, with whom I have made arrangements to have her sent to me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page132' name='book2_page132'></a>132</span>
in due season, whether in Banco or Remedios, I can not at present say.
I am minded to make an excellent report of your parish to Don Wenceslas,
and I am sure he will lend you support in your labors for the
welfare of the good folk of Simit&iacute;. Do not forget to include the little
locket with Carmen&rsquo;s effects when you deliver her to Don Mario. I assure
you of my warm affection for you, and for Rosendo, who mistakes
in his zeal to persecute me, as he will some day learn; and I commend
you both to the protecting care of our blessed Mother Mary.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;I kiss your hand, as your servant in Christ,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;DIEGO GUILLERMO POLO.&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked long and fixedly at the Alcalde. &ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo;
he finally said, &ldquo;do you believe Diego to be the father of
Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, Padre, I know it!&rdquo; replied the official with fervor.
&ldquo;He has the proofs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Padre; only that he has them. Surely the
child is his, and must be sent to him when he commands.
Meantime, you see, he gives the order to deliver her to me.
He has kindly arranged to relieve you and Rosendo of further
care of the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; with terrible earnestness, &ldquo;I will
give you the benefit of the doubt, and say that Diego has basely
deceived you. But as for him&ndash;&ndash;he lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> But I can not help if you disbelieve him. Still,
you must comply with his request; otherwise, the Bishop may
compel you to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; realized the terrible possibility of truth in this statement.
For an instant all his old despair rushed upon him.
Then he braced himself. Rosendo was holding his wrath in
splendid check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Don Mario,&rdquo; resumed Jos&egrave;, after a long meditation.
&ldquo;Let us ask our good Rosendo to leave us for a little moment
that we may with greater freedom discuss the necessary arrangements.
<i>Bien, amigo!</i>&rdquo; holding up a hand to check Rosendo,
who was rising menacingly before the Alcalde. &ldquo;You
will leave it to me.&rdquo; He threw Rosendo a significant look; and
the latter, after a momentary hesitation, bowed and passed out
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A prop&oacute;sito, amigo</i>,&rdquo; resumed Jos&egrave;, turning to the Alcalde
and assuming utter indifference with regard to Carmen. &ldquo;As
you will recall, I stood security for Rosendo&rsquo;s debts. The
thirty <i>pesos</i> which he owes you will be ready this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde smiled genially and rubbed his fat palms together.
&ldquo;<i>Muy bien</i>,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; reflected. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Don Mario, with regard to Carmen, justice must be
done, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page133' name='book2_page133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, Padre; and Padre Diego has the proofs&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I accept your word for your conviction in the
matter. But you will agree that there is something to be said
for Rosendo. He has fed, clothed, and sheltered the girl for
some eight years. Let us see, at the rate you charge your
<i>peones</i>, say, fifty pesos a day, that would amount to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took paper and pencil from the table and made a few
figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;to just fourteen hundred and sixty <i>pesos oro</i>,&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;This, then, is the amount now due Rosendo for the
care of Diego&rsquo;s child. You say he has made arrangements
with you to care for her until he can send for her. <i>Bien</i>, we
will deliver her to you for Diego, but only upon payment of
the sum which I have just mentioned. Otherwise, how will
Rosendo be reimbursed for the expense of her long maintenance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca&ndash;&ndash;ram&ndash;&ndash;ba!</i> Fourteen hundred and sixty <i>pesos oro</i>!
Why&ndash;&ndash;it is a fortune!&rdquo; ejaculated the outwitted Alcalde, his
eyes bulging over his puffy cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Jos&egrave; calmly, &ldquo;if we deliver the girl to
you to-day, I will retain the thirty <i>pesos oro</i> which Rosendo
owes you, and you will stand surety for the balance of the
debt, fourteen hundred and thirty, in that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Diablo!</i> but I will do nothing of the kind!&rdquo; exploded the
Alcalde. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> let Diego come and look after his own
brat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall consider the interview at an end, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my thirty <i>pesos oro</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night. And as much more for additional supplies. We
are still working together, are we not, Don Mario?&rdquo; he added
suggestively.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; in Simit&iacute; with money discounted a million Diegos
fleeing through the jungle. The Alcalde&rsquo;s heavy face melted
in a foolish grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto, buen Padre!</i> and&ndash;&ndash;La Libertad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have strong hopes,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; with bland assurance,
while a significant look came into his face. Then he rose and
bowed the Alcalde out. &ldquo;And, Don Mario&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a finger on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;we remain very silent, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto, Padre, cierto!</i> I am the grave itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the bulky official waddled off to his little shop, Jos&egrave;
turned back into his house with a great sigh of relief. Another
problem had been met&ndash;&ndash;temporarily.</p>
<p>He summoned Carmen to the day&rsquo;s lessons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>
</div>
<p>Within the month Juan brought from Bodega Central the
glad news of the revolution&rsquo;s utter collapse. The anticlerical
element, scenting treachery in their own ranks,
and realizing almost from the outset that the end was a matter
of only a few weeks, offered to capitulate on terms which they
felt would be less distressing to their pride than those which
their victors might dictate after inflicting a crushing defeat.
The conservatives did not take advantage of the <i>fiasco</i>, but
offered conciliation in the way of reapportioning certain minor
public offices, and a show of somewhat lessened clerical influence.
Peace followed rapidly. The fires of Jacobinism and
popery were again banked, while priest and politician, statesman
and orator set up the board and rearranged the pawns
for the next play.</p>
<p>Nothing further had been heard of Padre Diego during the
month, excepting that he had arrived at the settlement of
Juncal in a state of extreme agitation, and had hurriedly set
out that same day along the trail to the San Lucas district. Rosendo,
meanwhile, assured that Diego would not return in the
immediate future, yielded to Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s persuasion and departed
at once for Guamoc&oacute; on the news of the revolution&rsquo;s close.
Simit&iacute; had remained unmolested; and now, with the assurance
of indefinite peace, the old town dropped quickly back into her
wonted state of listless repose, and yielded to the drowsy,
dreamy influences that hover always about this scene of mediaeval
romance.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had recovered his equipoise; and even when Juan,
returning from his next trip down to the river, brought the
priest another sharp letter from Wenceslas, written in the
Bishop&rsquo;s name, he read it without a tremor. The letter complained
of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s silence, and especially of his failure to assist
the Catholic cause in this crisal hour by contributions of
Peter&rsquo;s Pence. Nor had any report been received in Cartagena
relative to the state of the parish of Simit&iacute;, its resources and
communicants; and not a <i>peso</i> had been offered to the support
of their so dear citadel at a time when its enemies threatened
its gates. Jos&egrave; smiled happily as he penned his reply, for he
knew that with Rosendo&rsquo;s next return their contributions to
Cartagena would begin. That meant the quieting of Wenceslas,
regardless of whatever report Diego might make. And it
was evident from this letter that neither Diego nor the Alcalde
had as yet communicated anything of a startling nature to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page135' name='book2_page135'></a>135</span>
Wenceslas regarding those things to which the priest had consecrated
himself in Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s life was never before so full. And never so sweet.
To his little flock he was now preaching the Word of God only
as he could interpret it to meet their simple needs. Gradually,
as he got closer to them, he sought to enlighten them and to
draw them at least a little way out of the dense materialism of
their present religious beliefs. He also strove to give them the
best of his own worldly knowledge, and to this end was talking
to them three nights a week in the church building, where the
simple people hung upon his words like children enwrapped in
fairy lore. He was holding regular Sunday services, and offering
Masses during the week for those of his parishioners who
requested them, and who would have been shocked, puzzled,
and unhappy had he refused to do so, or attempted to prove
their uselessness. He was likewise saying diurnal Masses for
the little Maria, to whom, as she lay breathing her last in his
arms in Cartagena, he had given the promise to offer them
daily in her behalf for, a year.</p>
<p>Nor was this the extent of his loving sacrifice for the girl.
He had already sent a small sum of money to Catalina by
Captain Julio, who promised to arrange at Calamar for its
transmission, and for the safe convoy of a similar small packet
monthly to Cartagena and into the hands of the two women
who were caring for the infant son of Wenceslas and the ill-fated
Maria. He had promised her that night that he would
care for her babe. And his life had long since shown what a
promise meant to him. He knew he would be unable to learn
of the child&rsquo;s progress directly from these women, for they
were both illiterate. But Captain Julio brought an encouraging
message from them, and assured Jos&egrave; that he would always
make inquiry for the babe on his trips down the river. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
long-distance dealings with the genial captain had been conducted
through Juan, who had constituted himself the priest&rsquo;s
faithful servant and the distant worshiper of the child Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave;,&rdquo; Juan had said one day, striving vainly to
hide his embarrassment, &ldquo;the little Carmen grows very beautiful.
She is like the Pascua-flower, that shines through the
ferns in the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i>. She is like the great blue butterfly, that
floats on the sunbeams that sift through the forest trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Juan, she is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you love her much, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much, indeed, Juan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, Padre, I, too, love her.&rdquo; He paused and dug the
hard ground with his bare toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;the little Carmen will marry&ndash;&ndash;some
day, will she not?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page136' name='book2_page136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; started. The thought had never occurred to him!
Carmen marry? After all, she was human, and&ndash;&ndash; But, no,
he could not, he would not, think of it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Juan&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;cannot say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, she will.&rdquo; Juan was growing bolder. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and,
Padre, I&ndash;&ndash;I should like it if she would marry me. Ah,
<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, already I adore her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; could not be angry. The faithful lad was deeply sincere.
And the girl would reach the marriageable age of that
country in all too short a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Juan,&rdquo; he remonstrated, &ldquo;you are too young! And
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;why, she is but a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Padre. But I am seventeen&ndash;&ndash;and I will wait for
her. Only say now that she shall be mine when the time
comes. Padre, say it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was deeply touched by the boy&rsquo;s earnest pleading. He
put his arm affectionately about the strong young shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Juan, and see what develops. She is very, very
young. We must all wait. And, meanwhile, do you serve her,
faithfully, as you see Rosendo and me doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face brightened with hope. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I am her slave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went back to his work with Carmen with his thought
full of mingled conjecture and resolve. He had thus far outlined
nothing for the girl&rsquo;s future. Nor had he the faintest
idea what the years might bring forth. But he knew that, in a
way, he was aiding in the preparation of the child for something
different from the dull, animal existence with which she
was at present surrounded, and that her path in life must
eventually lead far, far away from the shabby, crumbling town
which now constituted her material world. His task he felt
to be tremendous in the responsibility which it laid upon him.
What had he ever known of the manner of rearing children!
He had previously given the question of child-education but
scant consideration, although he had always held certain
radical ideas regarding it; and some of these he was putting to
the test. But had his present work been forecast while he lay
sunken in despair on the river steamer, he would have repudiated
the prediction as a figment of the imagination. Yet the
gleam which flashed through his paralyzed brain that memorable
day in the old church, when Rosendo opened his full heart
to him, had roused him suddenly from his long and despondent
lethargy, and worked a quick and marvelous renovation in his
wasted life. Following the lead of this unusual child, he was
now, though with many vicissitudes, slowly passing out of his
prison of egoism, and into the full, clear sunlight of a world
which he knew to be far less material than spiritual.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page137' name='book2_page137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>With the awakening had come the almost frenzied desire
to realize in Carmen what he had failed to develop within himself;
a vague hope that she might fill the void which a lifetime
of longing had expressed. A tremendous opportunity
now presented. Already the foundation had been well laid&ndash;&ndash;but
not by earthly hands. His task was to build upon it; and,
as he did so, to learn himself. He had never before realized
more than faintly the awful power for good or evil which a
parent wields over a child. He had no more than the slightest
conception of the mighty problem of child-education. And now
Carmen herself had shown him that real education must be
reared upon a foundation <i>wholly spiritual</i>. Yet this, he knew,
was just what the world&rsquo;s educators did not do. He could see
now how in the world the religious instinct of the child is early
quenched, smothered into complete or partial extinction beneath
the false tutelage of parents and teachers, to whom years
and adult stature are synonymous with wisdom, and who
themselves have learned to see the universe only through the
opaque lenses of matter and chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If children were not falsely educated to know all manner
of evil,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;what spiritual powers might they not
develop in adult life, powers that are as yet not even imagined!
But their primitive religious instinct is regarded by the worldly-wise
parent as but a part of the infant existence, which must
soon give place to the more solid and real beliefs and opinions
which the world in general regards as established and conventional,
even though their end is death. And so they teach their
children to make evil real, even while admonishing them to
protect themselves against it and eventually so to rise as to
overcome it, little realizing that the carnal belief of the reality
of evil which a child is taught to accept permeates its pure
thought like an insidious poison, and becomes externalized in
the conventional routine existence of mind in matter, soul in
body, a few brief years of mingled good and evil, and then
darkness&ndash;&ndash;the end here certain; the future life a vague, impossible
conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; determined that Carmen&rsquo;s education should be spiritual,
largely because he knew, constituted as she was, it could
not well be otherwise. And he resolved that from his teachings
she should glean nothing but happiness, naught but good.
With his own past as a continual warning, he vowed first that
never should the mental germ of fear be planted within this
child&rsquo;s mind. He himself had cringed like a coward before it
all his desolate life. And so his conduct had been consistently
slavish, specious, and his thought stamped with the brand of
the counterfeit. He knew not how much longer he must struggle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page138' name='book2_page138'></a>138</span>
with it. But he knew that, if he would progress, the warfare
must go on, until at length he should put it under his feet.
His mind still bore the almost ineradicable mold of the fear
deeply graven into it by the ignorant opinions, the worldly,
material, unspiritual beliefs of his dear but unwise parents.
His life had been hedged with baleful shadows because of it;
and over every bright picture there hung its black draping.
As he looked back over the path along which he had come, he
could see every untoward event, every unhappiness and bitter
disappointment, as the externalization of fear in some form,
the germ of which had been early planted in the fertile soil
of his plastic brain. Without it he might have risen to towering
heights. Under its domination he had sunk until the swirling
stream of life had eddied him upon the desolate shores of
Simit&iacute;. In the hands of the less fearful he had been a puppet.
In his own eyes he was a fear-shaped manikin, the shadow of
God&rsquo;s real man. The fear germ had multiplied within him a
billionfold, and in the abundant crop had yielded a mental depression
and deep-seated melancholy that had utterly stifled
his spirit and dried the marrow of his bones.</p>
<p>They were not pleasant, these thoughts. But now Jos&egrave;
could draw from them something salutary, something definite
to shape and guide his work with Carmen. She, at least, should
not grow up the slave of fearsome opinions and beliefs born of
dense ignorance. Nor should the baseless figments of puerile
religious systems find lodgment within her clear thought. The
fear element, upon which so much of so-called Christian belief
has been reared, and the damnable suggestions of hell
and purgatory, of unpardonable sin and endless suffering, the
stock-in-trade of poet, priest and prelate up to and overlapping
our present brighter day, should remain forever a closed
volume to this child, a book as wildly imaginative and as unacceptable
as the fabled travels of Maundeville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he would murmur to himself, as he strolled
alone in the dusk beside the limpid lake, &ldquo;that if I could plant
myself firmly on the Scriptural statement that God is love,
that He is good; and if I could regard Him as infinite mind,
while at the same time striving to recognize no reality, no intelligence
or life in things material, I could eventually triumph
over the whole false concept, and rise out of beliefs of sickness,
discord, and death, into an unalterable consciousness of good
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had made a beginning when he strove to realize that
man is not separated from God; that God is not a far-off abstraction;
and that infinite mind is, as Carmen insisted, &ldquo;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page139' name='book2_page139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is only the five physical senses that tell us evil is real,&rdquo;
he reflected. &ldquo;Indeed, without their testimony we would be
utterly unconscious of evil! And I am convinced that their
testimony is specious, and that we see, hear, and feel only in
thought, or in belief. We think the sensations of seeing, hearing,
and feeling come to us through the medium of these senses
as outward, fleshly contrivances, which in some way communicate
with the mind and bridge the gulf between the material
and the mental. In reality, we do but see, hear and feel <i>our
own thoughts</i>! The philosophers, many of them, said as much
centuries ago. So did Jesus. But&ndash;&ndash;the human mind has been
mesmerized, simply mesmerized!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These things he pondered day by day, and watched to see
them wrought out in the life of Carmen. &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he would
sometimes say, as spiritual ideas unfolded to him, &ldquo;you evolve
beautiful theories, my good Jos&egrave;, and you say many brave
things. But, when the day of judgment comes, as it did when
Juan brought you the news of the revolution, then, alas! your
theories fly to pieces, and you find yourself very human, very
material, and your God hidden behind the distant clouds.
When the test comes, you find you cannot prove your beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the man did not often indulge in self-condemnation,
for somehow he knew his ideas were right. When he realized
the character and specious nature of evil, and realized, too,
that &ldquo;by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
thou shalt be condemned,&rdquo; he knew that the stirring up of
evil by good, and the shaking of the ancient foundations of
carnal belief within his mentality, might mean fiery trials, still
awaiting him. And yet, the crown was for him who should
overcome. Overcome what? The false opinions of mankind,
the ignorant beliefs in matter and evil. For what, after all, is
responsible for all the evil in this world of ours? What but a
false concept of God? &ldquo;And if I keep my nose buried forever
in matter, how can I hope to see God, who is Spirit? And how
can I follow the Christ unless I think as he thought?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But it was in the classroom with Carmen that he always
received his greatest stimulus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Padre dear,&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;if I erase a wrong
figure and then set down the right one instead, I get the right
answer. And it is just like that when we think. If we always
put good thoughts in the place of the bad ones, why, everything
comes out right, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; smiled at the apt comparison. &ldquo;Of course, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;Only in your algebra you know which are the
right figures to put down. But how do you know which
thoughts are right?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page140' name='book2_page140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I always know, Padre. I can&rsquo;t make even the least mistake
about the thoughts. Why, it is easier to mistake with figures
than it is with thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that, little one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, if you always think God <i>first</i>, you can never
think wrong. Now can you? And if you think of other things
first you are almost sure to think of the wrong thing, is it not
so, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest had to admit the force of her statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you know, Padre dear,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;when I
understand the right rule in algebra, the answer just comes of
itself. Well, it is so with everything when we understand that
God is the right rule&ndash;&ndash;you call Him principle, don&rsquo;t you?&ndash;&ndash;well,
when we know that He is the only rule for everything,
then the answers to all our problems just come of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aye, thought Jos&egrave;, the healing works of the great Master
were only the &ldquo;signs following,&rdquo; the &ldquo;answers&rdquo; to the people&rsquo;s
problems, the sure evidence that Jesus understood the Christ-principle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you say that God is the right rule for everything,
just what do you mean, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That He is everywhere,&rdquo; the girl replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That He is infinite and omnipresent good, then?&rdquo; the priest
amplified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is good&ndash;&ndash;and everywhere,&rdquo; the child repeated firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the necessary corollary of that is, that there is no
evil,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by corollary, Padre dear.
It&rsquo;s a big word, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&ndash;&ndash;I think I know how you would put it, little one&ndash;&ndash;if
God is everywhere, then there is nothing bad. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assuredly he saw. He saw that a fact can have no real
opposite; that any predicated opposite must be supposition.
And evil is the supposition; whereas good is the fact. The
latter is &ldquo;plus,&rdquo; and the former &ldquo;minus.&rdquo; No wonder the
origin of evil has never been found, although humanity has
struggled with the problem for untold ages! Jesus diagnosed
evil as a lie. He gave it the minus sign, the sign of nothingness.
The world has tried to make it positive, something.
From the false sense of evil as a reality has come the equally
false sense of man&rsquo;s estrangement from God, through some
fictitious &ldquo;fall&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a curse, truly, upon the human intellect, but
not of God&rsquo;s infliction. For false belief always curses with a
reign of discord, which endures until the belief becomes corrected
by truth. From the beginning, the human race has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page141' name='book2_page141'></a>141</span>
vainly sought to postulate an equal and opposite to everything
in the realm of both the spiritual and material. It has been
hypnotized, obsessed, blinded, by this false zeal. The resultant
belief in &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; has rendered hate the equal and opposite
of Love, evil the equal and opposite of Good, and discord the
eternal opponent of Harmony. To cope with evil as a reality
is to render it immortal in our consciousness. To know its unreality
is to master it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout life,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; mused, &ldquo;every positive has its
negative, every affirmation its denial. But the opposites never
mingle. And, moreover, the positive always dispels the negative,
thus proving the specious nature of the latter. Darkness
flees before the light, and ignorance dissolves in the morning
rays of knowledge. Both cannot be real. The positive alone
bears the stamp of immortality. Carmen has but one fundamental
rule: <i>God is everywhere</i>. This gives her a sense of
immanent power, with which all things are possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus with study and meditation the days flowed past, with
scarcely a ripple to break their quiet monotony. Rosendo
came, and went again. He brought back at the end of his
first month&rsquo;s labors on the newly discovered deposit some
ninety <i>pesos</i> in gold. He had reached the bedrock, and the
deposit was yielding its maximum; but the yield would continue
for many months, he said. His exultation overleaped all
bounds, and it was with difficulty that Jos&egrave; could bring him to
a consideration of the problems still confronting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Rosendo,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;that we will send,
say, thirty <i>pesos</i> this month to Cartagena; the same next
month; and then increase the amount slightly. This method
is sure to have a beneficial effect upon the ecclesiastical authorities
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; ejaculated Rosendo. &ldquo;And how will you send it,
Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; pondered the situation. &ldquo;We cannot send the gold
direct to the Bishop, for that would excite suspicion. Masses,
you know, are not paid for in gold dust and nuggets. And we
have no money. Nor could we get the gold exchanged for bills
here in Simit&iacute;, even if we dared run the risk of our discovery
becoming known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the Alcalde was already nosing about in an effort to
ascertain the source of the gold with which Rosendo had just
cancelled his debt and purchased further supplies. Jos&egrave; now
saw that, under existing conditions, it would be utterly impossible
for Rosendo to obtain titles to mineral properties
through Don Mario. He spent hours seeking a solution of the
involved problem. Then, just before Rosendo departed again
for the mountains, Jos&egrave; called him into the parish house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page142' name='book2_page142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, I think I see a way. Bring me one of the paper
boxes of candles which you have just purchased from Don
Mario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carumba! Padre,&rdquo; queried the surprised Rosendo, as he
returned with the box, &ldquo;and what is this for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely want to get the name of the firm which sold the
candles. The Empresa Alemania, Barranquilla. Good! Now
listen. I have a method that is roundabout, but certainly
promises much. I will write to the firm, appointing them my
agents while I pose as Jos&egrave; Rinc&oacute;n, miner. The agency established,
I will send them our gold each month, asking them to
return to me its equivalent in bills, deducting, of course, their
commission. Then I will send these bills, or such part as we
deem wise, to Wenceslas. Each month Juan, who will be
sworn to secrecy, will convey the gold to Bodega Central in
time to meet Captain Julio&rsquo;s boat. The captain will both deliver
the gold to the Empresa Alemania, and bring back the
bills in exchange. Then, from Simit&iacute;, and in the regular
manner, I will send the small packet of bills to Wenceslas as
contributions from the parish. We thus throw Don Mario off
the scent, and arouse no suspicion in any quarter. As I receive
mail matter at various times, the Alcalde will not know but
what I also receive consignments of money from my own
sources. I think the plan will work out. Juan already belongs
to us. What, then, is there to fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, as it was arranged, it worked out. Juan reveled in
the honor of such intimate relations with the priest and Rosendo,
and especially in the thought that he was working in
secret for the girl he adored. By the time Rosendo returned
again from Guamoc&oacute;, Jos&egrave; had sent his first consignment of
money to the Bishop, carefully directing it to Wenceslas, personally,
and had received an acknowledgment in a letter which
caused him deep thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To further stimulate the piety of your communicants,&rdquo; it read, &ldquo;and
arouse them to more generous contributions to our glorious cause, you
will inform them that, if their monetary contributions do not diminish
in amount for the coming year, they will be made participants in the four
solemn Novenas which will be offered by His Grace, the Bishop of Cartagena.
Moreover, if their contributions increase, the names of the various
contributors will be included in the one hundred Masses which are
to be offered in December at the Shrine of Our Lady of Chiquinqu&iacute;a for
their spiritual and temporal welfare. Contributors will also have a High
Mass after death, offered by one of His Grace&rsquo;s assistants, as soon as
the notification of death is received here. In addition to these, His
Grace, always mindful of the former importance of the parish of Simit&iacute;,
and acknowledging as its special patron the ever blessed Virgin, has
arranged to bestow the episcopal blessing upon an image of the Sacred
Heart, which will be shipped to his faithful children in Simit&iacute; when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page143' name='book2_page143'></a>143</span>
amount of their contributions shall have met the expense thereof. Let
us keep ever in mind the pious words of the Bl. Margaret Mary, who has
conveyed to us the assurance which she received directly from Our
Blessed Lord that He finds great joy in beholding His Sacred Heart visibly
represented, that it may touch the hard hearts of mankind. Our
blessed Saviour promised the gracious Margaret Mary that He would
pour out abundantly of His rich treasure upon all who honor this image,
and that it shall draw down from heaven every blessing upon those who
adore and reverence it. Inform your parishioners that the recital of the
offering, &lsquo;O, Sacred Heart of Jesus, may it be everywhere adored!&rsquo; carries
a hundred days&rsquo; indulgence each time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will bear in mind that the General Intention for this month
is The Conversion of America. Though our Church is founded on the
Rock, and is to last forever, so that the gates of hell shall never prevail
against her, nevertheless she has been called upon to withstand
many assaults from her enemies, the advocates of <i>modernism</i>, in the land
of liberal thought to our north. These assaults, though painful to her,
can never be fatal to her spiritual life, although they unfortunately are
so to many of her dear children, who yield to the insidious persuasions
of the heretics who do the work of Satan among the Lord&rsquo;s sheep. New
and fantastic religions are springing up like noxious weeds in America
of the north, and increasing infidelity is apparent on every hand. The
Christ prayed that there might be one fold and one shepherd. It is for
us this month to pray for the great day when they will be accomplished.
But we must be united over the interests of the Sacred Heart. Therefore,
liberal plenary indulgences will be granted to those of the faithful
who contribute to this glorious cause, so dear to the heart of the blessed
Saviour. We enclose leaflets indicating the three degrees, consisting of
the Morning Offering, Our Father and ten Hail Marys daily, for the Pope
and his interests, and the degree of reparation, by which a plenary indulgence
may be gained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stimulate your parishioners to compete joyfully for the statue of
the Blessed Virgin, which we mentioned to you in our former communication.
Teach them, especially, their entire dependence on Mary, on her
prayers to God for their deliverance and welfare. Reveal to them her
singularly powerful influence in the shaping of all great historical events
of the world; how never has she refused our prayers to exert her mighty
influence with her all-potent Son, when she has been appealed to in sincerity,
for it rejoices the Sacred Heart of Jesus to yield to the requests of
His Blessed Mother. Mary is omnipotent, for she can ask no favor of
her Son that He will not grant. Competition for possession of this sacred
image, which carries the potent blessing of His Holiness, should be regarded
a privilege, and you will so impress it upon the minds of your
parishioners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, His Grace requests that you will immediately procure whatever
information you may regarding the mineral resources of the district
of Guamoc&oacute;, and indicate upon a sketch the location of its various
mines, old or new, as known to its inhabitants. Diligent and careful inquiry
made by yourself among the people of the district will reveal many
hidden facts regarding its resources, which should be made known to His
Grace at the earliest possible moment, in view of the active preparations
now in progress to forestall the precipitation of another political uprising
with its consequent strain upon our Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Money! money! money!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;One would think
the Christ had established his Church solely for gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded the letter and looked out through the rear door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page144' name='book2_page144'></a>144</span>
to where Carmen sat, teaching Cucumbra a new trick. He
realized then that never before had he been so far from the
Holy Catholic faith as at that moment. And Carmen&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he muttered, as his eyes rested upon the child.
&ldquo;If the Church should get possession of Carmen, what would
it do with her? Would it not set its forces to work to teach
her that evil is a reality&ndash;&ndash;that it is as powerful as good&ndash;&ndash;that
God formed man and the universe out of dust&ndash;&ndash;that Jesus
came down from a starry heaven that he might die to appease
the wrath of a man-like Father&ndash;&ndash;that Mary pleads with the
Lord and Jesus, and by her powerful logic induces them to
spare mankind and grant their foolish desires&ndash;&ndash;all the dribble
and rubbish of outlandish theology that has accumulated
around the nucleus of pure Christianity like a gathering snowball
throughout the ages! To make the great States up north
dominantly Catholic, Rome must&ndash;&ndash;simply <i>must</i>&ndash;&ndash;have the
children to educate, that she may saturate their absorbent
minds with these puerile, undemonstrable, pagan beliefs before
the child has developed its own independent thought. How
wise is she&ndash;&ndash;God, how worldly wise and cunning! And I still
her priest&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen came bounding in, followed pellmell by Cucumbra.
Cantar-las-horas stalked dignifiedly after her, and stopped at
the threshold, where he stood with cocked head and blinking
eyes, wondering what move his animated young mistress would
make next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the sun is down, and it is time
for our walk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized his hand and drew him out into the road. The
play of her expression as she looked up and laughed into his
face was like the dance of sunbeams on moving water. They
turned down the narrow street which led to the lake. As was
her wont, in every object about her, in every trifling event, the
child discovered rich treasures of happiness. The pebbles
which she tossed with her bare toes were mines of delight.
The pigs, which turned up their snouts expectantly as she
stooped to scratch their dusty backs&ndash;&ndash;the matronly hens that
followed clucking after her&ndash;&ndash;the black babies that toddled out
to greet the <i>Cura</i>&ndash;&ndash;all yielded a wealth of delight and interest.
She seemed to Jos&egrave; to uncover joy by a means not unlike the
divining rod, which points to hidden gold where to the eye
there is naught but barren ground.</p>
<p>Near the margin of the lake they stopped at the door of a
cottage, where they were awaited by the matron who displayed
a finger wrapped in a bit of cloth. She greeted the priest
courteously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page145' name='book2_page145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this morning I had the misfortune
to cut my finger while peeling yuccas, and I am not sure
whether a piece of the skin went into the pot or not. <i>Bueno</i>,
the yuccas are all cooked; and now my man says he will not
eat them, for this is Friday, and there may be meat with the
yuccas. What shall I do? Was it wicked to cook the yuccas,
not knowing if a bit of the skin from my finger had fallen into
the pot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stood dumfounded before such ignorant credulity.
Then he shook his head and replied sadly, &ldquo;No, se&ntilde;ora, it was
not wicked. Tell your man he may eat the yuccas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face brightened, and she hastened into the
house to apprise her spouse of the <i>Cura&rsquo;s</i> decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; muttered Jos&egrave; under his breath. &ldquo;Two
thousand years of Christianity, and still the world knows not
what Jesus taught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me he had good thoughts, Padre dear,&rdquo; said
the little voice at his side, as he walked slowly away with
bended head. &ldquo;And that is enough to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that, Carmen?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;, somewhat
petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Padre, if he had good thoughts, he thought about
God&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t he? And if he thought about God, he always
thought of something good. And if we always think about
good&ndash;&ndash;well, isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s eyes struggled with hers. She almost invariably
framed her replies with an interrogation, and, whether he would
or not, he must perforce give answers which he knew in his
heart were right, and yet which the sight of his eyes all too
frequently denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you are not thinking about God now&ndash;&ndash;are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed, child!&rdquo; he answered abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;perhaps you are thinking <i>about</i> Him; but you are
not thinking <i>with</i> Him&ndash;&ndash;are you?&ndash;&ndash;the way He thinks. You
know, He sends us His thoughts, and we have to pick them
out from all the others that aren&rsquo;t His, and then think them.
If the se&ntilde;ora and her man had been thinking God&rsquo;s thoughts,
they wouldn&rsquo;t have been afraid to eat a piece of meat on Friday&ndash;&ndash;would
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cucumbra, forgetting his many months of instruction, suddenly
yielded to the goad of animal instinct and started along
the beach in mad pursuit of a squealing pig. Carmen dashed
after him. As Jos&egrave; watched her lithe, active little body bobbing
over the shales behind the flying animals, she seemed to
him like an animated sunbeam sporting among the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should life,&rdquo; he murmured aloud, &ldquo;beginning in radiance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page146' name='book2_page146'></a>146</span>
proceed in ever deepening gloom, and end at last in
black night? Why, but for the false education in evil which
is inflicted upon us! The joys, the unbounded bliss of childhood,
do indeed gush from its innocence&ndash;&ndash;its innocence of the
blighting belief in mixed good and evil&ndash;&ndash;innocence of the false
beliefs, the undemonstrable opinions, the mad worldly ambitions,
the carnal lust, bloated pride, and black ignorance of
men! It all comes from not knowing God, to know whom is
life eternal! The struggle and mad strife of man&ndash;&ndash;what does it
all amount to, when &lsquo;in the end he shall be a fool&rsquo;? Do we in
this latest of the centuries, with all our boasted progress in
knowledge, really know so much, after all? Alas! we know
nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Padre,&rdquo; cried Carmen, returning to him, &ldquo;we are
going to just try now to have all the nice thoughts we can.
Let&rsquo;s just look all around us and see if we can&rsquo;t think good
thoughts about everything. And, do you know, Padre dear, I&rsquo;ve
tried it, and when I look at things and something tries to make
me see if there could possibly be anything bad about them&ndash;&ndash;why,
I find there can&rsquo;t! Try it, and see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew it. He knew that the minds of men are so profaned
by constantly looking at evil that their thoughts are
tinged with it. He was striving to look up. But in doing so he
was combating a habit grown mighty by years of indulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you always think good about a thing,&rdquo; the girl went
on, &ldquo;you never can tell what it will do. But good <i>always</i> comes
from it. I know. I do it all the time. If things look bad, I
just say, &lsquo;Why look, here&rsquo;s something trying to tell me that two
and two are seven!&rsquo; And then it goes away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your purity and goodness resist evil involuntarily, little
one,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, more to himself than to the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, what big words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, little one, it is just the meaning of the words that is
big,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>The girl was silent for some moments. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, I never thought of it before&ndash;&ndash;but it is true:
we don&rsquo;t see the meaning of words with the same eyes that we
see trees and stones and people, do we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; studied the question. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand what
you mean, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he was finally forced to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;the meaning of a word isn&rsquo;t something
that we can pick up, like a stone; or see, as we see the
lake out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Carmen, the meaning is spiritual&ndash;&ndash;mental; it is not
physically tangible. It is not seen with the fleshly eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meaning of a word is the inside of it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page147' name='book2_page147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the inside, the soul, of the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t see the word, either, do we?&rdquo; She shook her
brown curls in vigorous negation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, little one, we see only written or printed symbols; or
hear only sounds that convey to us the words. But the words
themselves are mental. We do not see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we think them.&rdquo; She meditated a while. &ldquo;But, Padre
dear,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;the inside, or soul, of everything is
mental. We never see it. We have to think it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right. The things we think we see are only
symbols. They stand for the real things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, they don&rsquo;t stand for anything!&rdquo; she replied abruptly.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked down at her in surprise. He waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, the real things are the things we don&rsquo;t see. And the
things we think we see are not real at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had ere this learned not to deny her rugged statements,
but to study them for their inner meaning, which the
child often found too deep for her limited vocabulary to express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things we think we see,&rdquo; he said, though he was addressing
his own thought, &ldquo;are called the physical. The things
we do not see or cognize with the physical senses are called
mental, or spiritual. Well?&rdquo; he queried, looking down again
into the serious little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, the very greatest things are those that we don&rsquo;t see
at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, <i>chiquita</i>. Love, life, joy, knowledge, wisdom, health,
harmony&ndash;&ndash;all these are spiritual ideas. The physical sometimes
manifests them&ndash;&ndash;and sometimes does not. And in the
end, called death, it ceases altogether to manifest them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;these things&ndash;&ndash;the very greatest things there are&ndash;&ndash;are
the souls of everything&ndash;&ndash;is it not so, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all these things came from God, and He is everywhere,
and so He is the soul of everything, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the same affirmative reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you see it?&ndash;&ndash;we are not seeing things all
around us! We don&rsquo;t see real things that we call trees and
stones and people! We see only what we <i>think</i> we see. We
see things that are not there at all! We see&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we see only our thoughts. And we think we see them
as objects all about us, as trees, and houses, and people. But
in the final analysis we see only thoughts,&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But these thoughts do not come from God,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;because they often manifest discord
and error. I think I grasp what is struggling in your
mind <i>chiquita</i>. God is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page148' name='book2_page148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is everywhere, and therefore He is the soul&ndash;&ndash;the inside&ndash;&ndash;the
heart and core&ndash;&ndash;of everything. He is mind, and His
thoughts are real, and are the only real thoughts there are.
He is truth. The opposite of truth is a lie. But, in reality,
truth cannot have an opposite. Therefore, a lie is a supposition.
And so the thought that we seem to see externalized all
about us, and that we call physical objects, is supposition only.
And, a supposition being unreal, the whole physical universe,
including material man, is unreal&ndash;&ndash;is a supposition, a supposition
of mixed good and evil, for it manifests both. It is the lie
about God. And, since a lie has no real existence, this human
concept of a universe and mankind composed of matter is
utterly unreal, an image of thought, an illusion, existing in
false thought only&ndash;&ndash;a belief&ndash;&ndash;a supposition pure and simple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he talked he grew more and more animated. He seemed
to forget the presence of the child, and appeared to be addressing
only his own insistent questionings.</p>
<p>They walked along together in silence for some moments.
Then the girl again took up the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know, you taught me to prove my
problems in arithmetic and algebra. Well, I have proved
something about thinking, too. If I think a thing, and just
keep thinking it, pretty soon I see it&ndash;&ndash;in some way&ndash;&ndash;outside
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light seemed to flash through Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s mental chambers, and
he recalled the words of the explorer in Cartagena. Yes, that
was exactly what he had said&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;every thought that comes into
the mind tends to become <i>externalized</i>, either upon the body
as a physical condition, or in the environment, or as an event,
good or bad.&rdquo; It was a law, dimly perceived, but nevertheless
sufficiently understood in its workings to indicate a tremendous
field as yet all but unknown. The explorer had called it the
law of the externalization of thought. &ldquo;As a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he,&rdquo; said the Master, twenty centuries before.
Did he recognize the law?</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thought swept over his past. Had his own wrong
thinking, or the wrong thought of others, been the cause of his
unhappiness and acute mental suffering? But why personalize
it? What difference whether it be called his, or the Archbishop&rsquo;s,
or whose? Let it suffice that it was false thought,
undirected by the Christ-principle, God, that had been externalized
in the wreckage which he now called his past life.</p>
<p>He again stood face to face with the most momentous question
ever propounded by a waiting world: the question of
causation. And he knew now that causation was wholly
spiritual.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page149' name='book2_page149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, you said just now that God was mind. But,
if that is true, there is only one mind, for God is everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; dreamily responded the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then He is your mind and my mind, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if He is my mind, there just isn&rsquo;t anything good that
I can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twilight does not linger in the tropics, and already the
shadows that stole down through the valley had wrapped the
man and child in their mystic folds. Hand in hand they turned
homeward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, if God is my mind, He will do my thinking for me.
And all I have to do is to keep the door open and let His
thoughts come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her sweet voice lingered on the still night air. There was
a pensive gladness in the man&rsquo;s heart as he tightly held her
little hand and led her to Rosendo&rsquo;s door.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_18' id='CHAPTER_18'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 18</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning Jos&egrave; read to Rosendo portions of the
communication from Wenceslas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiquinqu&iacute;a,&rdquo; commented the latter. &ldquo;I remember
that Padre Diego collected much money from our people for
Masses to be said at that shrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is it, Rosendo?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know the story?&rdquo; queried Rosendo in surprise.
&ldquo;Why, there is not a shrine in the whole of Colombia that
works so many cures as this one. Your grandfather, Don
Ignacio, knew the place. And it was from him that my&ndash;&ndash;that
is, I learned the legend when I was only a boy. It is said that
a poor, sick young girl in the little Indian village of Chiquinqu&iacute;a,
north of Bogot&aacute;, stood praying in her shabby little cottage
before an old, torn picture of the blessed Virgin.&rdquo; He stopped
and crossed himself devoutly. Then he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, while the girl prayed, the picture suddenly rose up
in the air; the torn places all closed; the faded colors came
again as fresh as ever; and the girl was cured of her affliction.
The people of the village immediately built a shrine, over which
they hung the picture; and ever since then the most wonderful
miracles have been performed by it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe that, do you, Rosendo?&rdquo;
he asked in banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the latter a bit testily. &ldquo;I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page150' name='book2_page150'></a>150</span>
it! Did not Don Felipe go there when the doctor in Mompox
told him the little white spot on his hand was leprosy? And
he came back cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leprosy! Jos&egrave; started as if he had received a blow. He
looked furtively at the scar on his own hand, the hand which
the leper in Maganguey had lacerated that dreadful night, and
which often burned and ached as if seared by a hot iron. He
had never dared to voice the carking fear that tightened about
his heart at times. But often in the depths of night, when
dread anticipation sat like a spectre upon his bed, he had
risen and gone out into the darkness to wrestle with his black
thoughts. Leprosy! All the gladness and joy left his heart,
and a pall of darkness settled over his thought. He turned
back into his cottage and tried to find forgetfulness in the
simple duties that lay at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; he asked himself, as he sat wearily down at his
little table, &ldquo;that I always think of evil first; while Carmen&rsquo;s
first thought is invariably of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the ugly scar on his hand. What thought was
externalized in the loathsome experience which produced that?
he wondered. Was it the summation of all the fear, the weakness,
the wrong belief, that had filled his previous years? And
now why was he finding it so difficult to practice what Carmen
lived, even though he knew it was truth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he murmured aloud, &ldquo;it was the seminary that did
it. For there my thought was educated away from the simple
teachings of Jesus. To Carmen there is no mystery in godliness.
Though she knows utterly nothing about Jesus, yet she
hourly uses the Christ-principle. It is the children who grasp
the simple truths of God; while the lack of spirituality which
results from increasing years shrinks maturer minds until
they no longer afford entrance to it. For godliness is broad;
and the mind that receives it must be opened wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sat with his bowed head clasped in his hands, a sweet,
airy voice greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;ah, I caught you that time!&ndash;&ndash;you were
thinking that two and two are seven, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She shook
a rebuking finger at him.</p>
<p>Framed in the doorway like an old masterpiece, the sunlight
bronzing her heavy brown curls, the olive-tinted skin of
her bare arms and legs flushing with health, and her cheap
calico gown held tightly about her, showing the contour of her
full and shapely figure, the girl appeared to Jos&egrave; like a vision
from the realm of enchantment. And he knew that she did
dwell in the land of spiritual enchantment, where happiness
is not at the mercy of physical sense.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page151' name='book2_page151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord our God is a right-thinking God, and right-thinking
is what He desires in His people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; thought of this as he looked at Carmen. This
barefoot girl, who walked humbly, trustingly, with her God,
had she not supplied him with a working formula for his every
problem, even to the casting out of the corroding fear planted
in his heart by that awful experience in Maganguey? Though
he had suffered much, yet much had been done for him. The
brusque logic of the explorer had swept his mind clear of its
last vestige of theological superstition, and prepared it for
the truth which, under the benign stimulus of this clear-minded
child, would remake his life, if he could now yield himself
utterly to it. He must&ndash;&ndash;he would&ndash;&ndash;ceaselessly strive, even
though he fell daily, to make his life a pattern of hers, wherein
there was no knowledge of evil!</p>
<p>The girl came to the priest and leaned fondly against him.
Then a little sigh escaped her lips, as she looked down into
his face with pitying affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she said, in a tone that echoed a strain of
sadness, &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t believe&ndash;&ndash;you love God very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was startled, and resentment began to well in his
heart. &ldquo;What a thing to say, Carmen!&rdquo; he answered reprovingly.</p>
<p>The girl looked up at him with great, wondering eyes. &ldquo;But,
Padre,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;were you not thinking of things that
are not true when I came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I was&ndash;&ndash;I was thinking of the future&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;well, <i>chiquita</i>,
I was thinking of something that might happen some
day, that is all.&rdquo; He stumbled through it with difficulty, for
he knew he must not lie to the child. Would she ever trust
him again if he did?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre, were you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid? Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, I was.&rdquo; He hung his head.</p>
<p>Carmen looked at him reproachfully. &ldquo;Then, Padre, I was
right&ndash;&ndash;for, if you loved God, you would trust Him&ndash;&ndash;and then
you couldn&rsquo;t be afraid of anything&ndash;&ndash;could you? People who
love Him are not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head away. &ldquo;Ah, child,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;you will find that out in the world people don&rsquo;t love God in
this day and generation. At least they don&rsquo;t love Him that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t love Him enough to trust him?&rdquo; she asked
wistfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page152' name='book2_page152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He shook his head sadly. &ldquo;Nobody trusts Him, not
even the preachers themselves. When things happen, they
rush for a doctor, or some other human being to help them out
of their difficulty. They don&rsquo;t turn to Him any more. They
seldom speak His name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have&ndash;&ndash;they&ndash;&ndash;forgotten Him?&rdquo; she asked slowly, her voice
sinking to a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; He again buried his head in his hands.</p>
<p>The child stood in silence for some moments. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made them forget Him, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, <i>chiquita</i>, they turned from Him because He didn&rsquo;t
answer their prayers. I used to pray to Him, too. I prayed
hours at a time. But nothing seemed to come of it. And so I
stopped.&rdquo; He spoke bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You prayed! You mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Him for things&ndash;&ndash;to help me out of trouble&ndash;&ndash;I asked
Him to give me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre! Why&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the very reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at her blankly. &ldquo;What is the very reason?
What are you trying to tell me, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, He is everywhere, and He is right here all the time.
And so there couldn&rsquo;t be any real trouble for Him to help you
out of; and He couldn&rsquo;t give you anything, for He has already
done that, long ago. We are in Him, don&rsquo;t you know? Just like
the little fishes in the lake. And so when you asked Him for
things it showed that you didn&rsquo;t believe He had already given
them to you. And&ndash;&ndash;you know what you said last night about
thinking, and that when we think things, we see them? Well,
He has given you everything; but you thought He hadn&rsquo;t, and
so you saw it that way&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for breath. She had talked rapidly and with
animation. But before he could reply she resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, you know you told me that Jesus was the
best man that ever lived, and that it was because he never had
a bad thought&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did he pray&ndash;&ndash;did he ask God for things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did, child!&rdquo; the priest exclaimed. &ldquo;He always
asked Him for things. Why, he was always praying&ndash;&ndash;the
New Testament is full of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting on a sudden impulse, he rose and went into the
sleeping room to get his Bible. The child&rsquo;s face took on an
expression of disappointment as she heard his words. Her
brow knotted, and a troubled look came into her brown eyes.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; returned with his Bible and seated himself again at
the table. Opening the book, his eyes fell upon a verse of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page153' name='book2_page153'></a>153</span>
Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. He stopped to read it; and then read it again.
Suddenly he looked up at the waiting girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Padre? What does it say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. He read the verse again; then he scanned the
child closely, as if he would read a mystery hidden within her
bodily presence. Abruptly he turned to the book and read
aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire,
when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew a long breath, almost a sigh, as if a weight had
been removed from her mind. &ldquo;Did Jesus say that?&rdquo; she asked
in glad, eager tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;at least it is so reported here,&rdquo; he answered absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;<i>he</i> knew, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew what, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, he told the people to know&ndash;&ndash;just <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;that
they already had everything&ndash;&ndash;that God had given them
everything good&ndash;&ndash;and that if they would <i>know</i> it, they would
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Externalization of thought? Yes; or rather, the externalization
of truth. Jos&egrave; fell into abstraction, his eyes glued to the
page. There it stood&ndash;&ndash;the words almost shouted it at him!
And there it had stood for nearly two thousand years, while
priest and prelate, scribe and commentator had gone over it
again and again through the ages, without even guessing its
true meaning&ndash;&ndash;without even the remotest idea of the infinite
riches it held for mankind!</p>
<p>He turned reflectively to Matthew; and then to John. He
remembered the passages well&ndash;&ndash;in the past he had spent hours
of mortal agony poring over them and wondering bitterly why
God had failed to keep the promises they contain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
ye shall receive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All things&ndash;&ndash;when ye ask <i>believing</i>! But that Greek word
surely held vastly more than the translators have drawn from
it. Nay, not believing only, but <i>understanding</i> the allness of
God as good, and the consequent nothingness of evil, all that
seems to oppose Him! How could the translators have so
completely missed the mark! And Carmen&ndash;&ndash;had never seen a
Bible until he came into her life; yet she knew, knew instinctively,
that a good God who was &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; could not possibly
withhold anything good from His children. It was the
simplest kind of logic.</p>
<p>But, thought Jos&egrave; again, if the promises are kept, why have
we fallen so woefully short of their realization? Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page154' name='book2_page154'></a>154</span>
read again, &ldquo;If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye
shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&rdquo; The
promise carries a condition&ndash;&ndash;abiding in his words&ndash;&ndash;obeying
his commands&ndash;&ndash;keeping the very <i>first</i> Commandment, which is
that &ldquo;Ye shall have no other gods before me&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;no gods of evil,
sickness, chance, or death. The promises are fulfilled only on
the condition of righteousness&ndash;&ndash;right-thinking about God and
His infinite, spiritual manifestation.</p>
<p>He turned to Carmen. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said tenderly, &ldquo;you
never ask God to give you things, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Padre; why should I? He gives me everything I
need, doesn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;when you go out to the shales, you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask Him for things, Padre dear. I just tell Him I
<i>know</i> He is everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&ndash;&ndash;yes, you told me that long ago&ndash;&ndash;I understand, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;
His spirit bowed in humble reverence before such divine
faith. This untutored, unlearned girl, isolated upon these
burning shales, far, far from the haunts of men of pride and
power and worldly lore&ndash;&ndash;this barefoot child whose coffers held
of material riches scarce more than the little calico dress upon
her back&ndash;&ndash;this lowly being knew that which all the fabled
wealth of Ind could never buy! Her prayers were not the selfish
pleadings that spring from narrow souls, the souls that &ldquo;ask
amiss&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;not the frenzied yearnings wrung from suffering,
ignorant hearts&ndash;&ndash;nor were they the inflated instructions addressed
to the Almighty by a smug, complacent clergy, the self-constituted
press-bureau of infinite Wisdom. Her prayers,
which so often drifted like sweetest incense about those steaming
shales, were not petitions, but <i>affirmations</i>. They did not
limit God. She did not plead with Him. She simply <i>knew</i> that
He had already met her needs. And that righteousness&ndash;&ndash;right-thinking&ndash;&ndash;became
externalized in her consciousness in the good
she sought. Jesus did the same thing, over and over again;
but the poor, stupid minds of the people were so full of wrong
beliefs about his infinite Father that they could not understand,
no, not even when he called Lazarus from the tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask in my name,&rdquo; urged the patient Jesus. But the poor
fishermen thought he meant his human name to be a talisman,
a sort of &ldquo;Open Sesame,&rdquo; when he was striving all the time, by
precept and deed, to show them that they must ask in his
<i>character</i>, must be like him, to whom, though of himself he
could do nothing, yet all things were possible.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart began to echo the Master&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Father, I
thank Thee that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.&rdquo; He put his arm
about Carmen and drew her to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page155' name='book2_page155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Little one,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;how much has happened in
these past few weeks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked up at him with an enigmatical glance and
laughed. &ldquo;Well, Padre dear, I don&rsquo;t think anything ever really
<i>happens</i>, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistakes happen, as in solving my algebra problems. But
good things never happen, any more than the answers to my
problems happen. You know, there are rules for getting the
answers; but there are no rules for making mistakes&ndash;&ndash;are
there? But when anything comes out according to the rule,
it doesn&rsquo;t happen. And the mistakes, which have no rules, are
not real&ndash;&ndash;the answers are real, but the mistakes are not&ndash;&ndash;and
so nothing ever really happens. Don&rsquo;t you see, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, I see,&rdquo; he acquiesced. Then, while he held the
girl close to him, he reflected: Good is never fortuitous. It
results from the application of the Principle of all things. The
answer to a mathematical problem is a form of good, and it results
from the application of the principle of mathematics.
Mistakes, and the various things which &ldquo;happen&rdquo; when we solve
mathematical problems, do not have rules, or principles. They
result from ignorance of them, or their misapplication. And
so in life; for chance, fate, luck, accident and the merely casual,
come, not from the application of principles, but from not applying
them, or from ignorance of their use. The human mind
or consciousness, which is a mental activity, an activity of
thought, is concerned with mixed thoughts of good and evil.
But <i>it operates without any principle whatsoever</i>. For, if God
is infinite good, then the beliefs of evil which the human mind
holds must be false beliefs, illusions, suppositions. A supposition
has no principle, no rule. And so, it is only the unreal
that happens. And even that sort of &ldquo;happening&rdquo; can be prevented
by knowing and using the principle of all good, God.
A knowledge of evil is not knowledge at all. Evil has no rules.
Has an accident a principle? He laughed aloud at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Padre?&rdquo; asked Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, child&ndash;&ndash;and everything! But we are neglecting
our work,&rdquo; he hastily added, as he roused himself. &ldquo;What are
the lessons for to-day? Come! come! We have much to do!&rdquo;
And arranging his papers, and bidding Carmen draw up to the
table, he began the morning session of his very select little
school.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>More than six months had elapsed since Jos&egrave; first set foot
upon the hot shales of Simit&iacute;. In that time his mentality had
been turned over like a fallow field beneath the plowshare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page156' name='book2_page156'></a>156</span>
After peace had been established in the country he had often
thought to consecrate himself to the task of collecting the
fragmentary ideas which had been evolved in his mind during
these past weeks of strange and almost weird experience, and
trying to formulate them into definite statements of truth. Then
he would enter upon the task of establishing them by actual
demonstration, regardless of the years that might be required
to do so. He realized now that the explorer had done a great
work in clearing his mind of many of its darker shadows. But
it was to Carmen&rsquo;s purer, more spiritual influence that he knew
his debt was heaviest.</p>
<p>Let it not seem strange that mature manhood and extensive
travel had never before brought to this man&rsquo;s mind the truths,
many of which have been current almost since the curtain first
arose on the melodrama of mundane existence. Well nigh
impassable limitations had been set to them by his own natal
characteristics; by his acutely morbid sense of filial love which
bound him, at whatever cost, to observe the bigoted, selfish
wishes of his parents; and by the strictness with which his
mind had been hedged about both in the seminary and in the
ecclesiastical office where he subsequently labored. The first
rays of mental freedom did not dawn upon his darkened
thought until he was sent as an outcast to the New World.
Then, when his greater latitude in Cartagena, and his still
more expanded sense of freedom in Simit&iacute;, had lowered the
bars, there had rushed into his mentality such a flood of ideas
that he was all but swept away in the swirling current.</p>
<p>It is not strange that he rose and fell, to-day strong in the
conviction of the immanence of infinite good, to-morrow sunken
in mortal despair of ever demonstrating the truth of the ideas
which were swelling his shrunken mind. His line of progress
in truth was an undulating curve, slowly advancing toward the
distant goal to which Carmen seemed to move in a straight,
undeviating line. What though Emerson had said that Mind
was &ldquo;the only reality of which men and all other natures are
better or worse reflectors&rdquo;? Jos&egrave; was unaware of the sage&rsquo;s
mighty deduction. What though Plato had said that we move
as shadows in a world of ideas? Even if Jos&egrave; had known of it,
it had meant nothing to him. What though the Transcendentalists
called the universe &ldquo;a metaphore of the human mind&rdquo;?
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thought was too firmly clutched by his self-centered,
material beliefs to grasp it. Doubt of the reality of things material
succumbed to the evidence of the physical senses and
the ridicule of his seminary preceptors. True, he believed with
Paul, that the &ldquo;things that are seen are temporal; the things
that are unseen, are eternal.&rdquo; But this pregnant utterance conveyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page157' name='book2_page157'></a>157</span>
nothing more to him than a belief of a material heaven to
follow his exit from a world of matter. It had never occurred
to him that the world of matter might be the product of those
same delusive physical senses, through which he believed he
gained his knowledge of it. It is true that while in the seminary,
and before, he had insisted upon a more spiritual interpretation
of the mission of Jesus&ndash;&ndash;had insisted that Christian
priests should obey the Master&rsquo;s injunction, and heal the sick
as well as preach the gospel. But with the advent of the troubles
which filled the intervening years, these things had gradually
faded; and the mounting sun that dawned upon him
six months before, as he lay on the damp floor of his little cell
in the ecclesiastical dormitory in Cartagena, awaiting the Bishop&rsquo;s
summons, illumined only a shell, in which agnosticism
sat enthroned upon a stool of black despair.</p>
<p>Then Carmen entered his life. And her beautiful love,
which enfolded him like a garment, and her sublime faith,
which moved before him like the Bethlehem star to where the
Christ-principle lay, were, little by little, dissolving the mist
and revealing the majesty of the great God.</p>
<p>In assuming to teach the child, Jos&egrave; early found that the
outer world meant nothing to her until he had purged it of its
carnal elements. Often in days past, when he had launched
out upon the dramatic recital of some important historical
event, wherein crime and bloodshed had shaped the incident,
the girl would start hastily from her chair and put her little
hand over his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Padre dear! It is not true!&rdquo; she would exclaim.
&ldquo;God didn&rsquo;t do it, and it isn&rsquo;t so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereby he learned to differentiate more closely between
those historical events which sprang from good motives, and
those which manifested only human passion, selfish ambition,
and the primitive question, &ldquo;Who shall be greatest?&rdquo; Moreover,
he had found it best in his frequent talks to the people
in the church during the week to omit all reference to the evil
methods of mankind in their dealings one with another, and to
pass over in silence the criminal aims and low motives, and
their externalization, which have marked the unfolding of the
human mind, and which the world preserves in its annals as
historical fact. The child seemed to divine the great truth that
history is but the record of human conduct, conduct manifesting
the mortal mind of man, a mind utterly opposed to the mind
that is God, and therefore unreal, supposititious, and bearing
the &ldquo;minus&rdquo; sign. Carmen would have none of it that did not
reflect good. She refused utterly to turn her mental gaze toward
recorded evil.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page158' name='book2_page158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she once protested, &ldquo;when I want to see the sun
rise, I don&rsquo;t look toward the west. And if you want to see the
good come up, why do you look at these stories of bad men
and their bad thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; admitted that they were records of the mortal mind&ndash;&ndash;and
the mind that is mortal is <i>no</i> mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am learning,&rdquo; he frequently said to himself, after Carmen
had left at the close of their day&rsquo;s work. &ldquo;But my real education
did not commence until I began to see, even though faintly,
that the Creator is mind and infinite good, and that there is
nothing real to the belief in evil; that the five physical senses
give us <i>no</i> testimony of any nature whatsoever; and that real
man never could, never did, fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the days glided swiftly past, and Jos&egrave; completed his
first year amid the drowsy influences of this little town, slumbering
peacefully in its sequestered nook at the feet of the
green <i>Cordilleras</i>. No further event ruffled its archaic civilization;
and only with rare frequency did fugitive bits of news
steal in from the outer world, which, to the untraveled thought
of this primitive folk, remained always a realm vague and
mysterious. Quietly the people followed the routine of their
colorless existence. Each morn broke softly over the limpid
lake; each evening left the blush of its roseate sunset on the
glassy waters; each night wound its velvety arms gently about
the nodding town, while the stars beamed like jewels through
the clear, soft atmosphere above, or the yellow moonbeams
stole noiselessly down the old, sunken trail to dream on the
lake&rsquo;s invisible waves.</p>
<p>Each month, with unvarying regularity, Rosendo came and
went. At times Jos&egrave; thought he detected traces of weariness,
insidious and persistently lurking, in the old man&rsquo;s demeanor.
At times his limbs trembled, and his step seemed heavy. Once
Jos&egrave; had found him, seated back of his cottage, rubbing the
knotted muscles of his legs, and groaning aloud. But when he
became aware of Jos&egrave; presence, the groans ceased, and the old
man sprang to his feet with a look of such grim determination
written across his face that the priest smothered his apprehensions
and forbore to speak. Rosendo was immolating
himself upon his love for the child. Jos&egrave; knew it; but he would
not, if he could, prevent the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Each month their contributions were sent to Cartagena; and
as regularly came a message from Wenceslas, admonishing
them to greater efforts. With the money that was sent to the
Bishop went also a smaller packet to the two women who were
caring for the unfortunate Maria&rsquo;s little babe. The sources of
Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s remittances to Cartagena were never questioned by Wenceslas.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page159' name='book2_page159'></a>159</span>
But Simit&iacute; slowly awakened to the mysterious monthly
trips of Rosendo; and Don Mario&rsquo;s suspicion became conviction.
He bribed men to follow Rosendo secretly. They came
back, footsore and angry. Rosendo had thrown them completely
off the scent. Then Don Mario outfitted and sent his
paid emissary after the old man. He wasted two full months in
vain search along the Guamoc&oacute; trail. But the fever came upon
him, and he refused to continue the hunt. The Alcalde counted
the cost, then loudly cursed himself and Rosendo for the many
good <i>pesos</i> so ruthlessly squandered. Then he began to ply
Jos&egrave; and Rosendo with skillfully framed questions. He worried
the citizens of the village with his suggestions. Finally he bethought
himself to apprise the Bishop of his suspicions. But
second consideration disclosed that plan as likely to yield him
nothing but loss. He knew Rosendo was getting gold from
some source. But, too, he was driving a good trade with the
old man on supplies. He settled back upon his fat haunches
at last, determined to keep his own counsel and let well-enough
alone for the present, while he awaited events.</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s vivid interest in Carmen&rsquo;s progress was almost
pathetic. When in Simit&iacute; he hung over the child in rapt absorption
as she worked out her problems, or recited her lessons
to Jos&egrave;. Often he shook his head in witness of his utter
lack of comprehension. But Carmen understood, and that
sufficed. His admiration for the priest&rsquo;s learning was deep and
reverential. He was a silent worshiper, this great-hearted
man, at the shrine of intellect; but, alas! he himself knew only
the rudiments, which he had acquired by years of patient,
struggling effort, through long days and nights filled with toil.
His particular passion was his Castilian mother-tongue; and the
precision with which he at times used it, his careful selection
of words, and his wide vocabulary, occasioned Jos&egrave; no little
astonishment. One day, after returning from the hills, he approached
Jos&egrave; as the latter was hearing Carmen&rsquo;s lessons, and,
with considerable embarrassment, offered him a bit of paper
on which were written in his ample hand several verses. Jos&egrave;
read them, and then looked up wonderingly at the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rosendo, these are beautiful! Where did you get
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;they are mine, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, his face glowing
with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours! Do you mean that you wrote them?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; queried
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre. Nights, up in Guamoc&oacute;, when I had finished
my work, and when I was so lonely, I would sometimes light
my candle and try to write out the thoughts that came to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page160' name='book2_page160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; could not keep back the tears. He turned his head,
that Rosendo might not see them. Of the three little poems,
two were indited to the Virgin Mary, and one to Carmen. He
lingered over one of the verses of the latter, for it awoke
responsive echoes in his own soul:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Without you, the world&ndash;&ndash;a desert of sadness;<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>But with you, sweet child&ndash;&ndash;a vale of delight;<br />
You laugh, like the sunbeam&ndash;&ndash;my gloom becomes gladness;<br />
<span class='indent4'>&nbsp;</span>You sing&ndash;&ndash;from my heart flee the shadows of night.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have written a good deal of poetry during my life,
Padre. I will show you some of it, if you wish,&rdquo; Rosendo advanced,
encouraged by Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly, I would!&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave; with animation. &ldquo;And
to think, without instruction, without training! What a lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, when I think of the blessed Virgin or the little
Carmen, my thoughts seem to come in poetry.&rdquo; He stooped
over the girl and kissed her. The child reached up and clasped
her arms about his black neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo,&rdquo; she said sweetly, &ldquo;you are a poem, a big
one, a beautiful one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; seconded Jos&egrave;, and there was a hitch in his voice,
&ldquo;you are an epic&ndash;&ndash;and the world is the poorer that it cannot
read you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, though showing such laudable curiosity regarding the
elements which entered into their simple life in Simit&iacute;, Rosendo
seldom spoke of matters pertaining to religion. Yet Jos&egrave; knew
that the old faith held him, and that he would never, on this
plane of existence, break away from it. He clung to his <i>escapulario</i>;
he prostrated himself before the statue of the Virgin;
he invoked the aid of Virgin and Saints when in distress; and,
unlike most of the male inhabitants of the town, he scrupulously
prayed his rosary every night, whether at home, or on
the lonely margins of the Tigu&iacute;. He had once said to Jos&egrave; that
he was glad Padre Diego had baptised the little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;he
felt safer to have it so. And yet he would not have her brought
up in the Holy Catholic faith. Let her choose or formulate her
own religious beliefs, they should not be influenced by him or
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never make me believe, Padre,&rdquo; he would sometimes
say to the priest, &ldquo;that the little Carmen was not left by
the angels on the river bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo, how foolish!&rdquo; remonstrated Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;You
have Escolastico&rsquo;s account, and the boat captain&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what then? Even the blessed Saviour was born
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page161' name='book2_page161'></a>161</span>
of a woman; and yet he came from heaven. The angels brought
him, guarded him as he lay in the manger, protected him all his
life, and then took him back to heaven again. And I tell you,
Padre, the angels brought Carmen, and they are always with
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; ceased to dispute the old man&rsquo;s contentions. For, had
he been pressed, he would have been forced to admit that there
was in the child&rsquo;s pure presence a haunting spell of mystery&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
the mystery of godliness&ndash;&ndash;but yet an undefinable
<i>something</i> that always made him approach her with a feeling
akin to awe.</p>
<p>And in the calm, untroubled seclusion of Simit&iacute;, in its mediaeval
atmosphere of romance, and amid its ceaseless dreams
of a stirring past, the child unfolded a nature that bore the
stamp of divinity, a nature that communed incessantly with her
God, and that read His name in every trivial incident, in every
stone and flower, in the sunbeams, the stars, and the whispering
breeze. In that ancient town, crumbling into the final stages
of decrepitude, she dwelt in heaven. To her, the rude adobe
huts were marble castles; the shabby rawhide chairs and hard
wooden beds were softest down; the coarse food was richer
than a king&rsquo;s spiced viands; and over it all she cast a mantle of
love that was rich enough, great enough, to transform with the
grace of fresh and heavenly beauty the ruins and squalor of
her earthly environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can a child like Carmen live a sinless life, and still be
human?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; often mused, as he watched her flitting through
the sunlit hours. &ldquo;It is recorded that Jesus did. Ah, yes; but
he was born of a virgin, spotless herself. And Carmen? Is
she any less a child of God?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; often wondered, wondered
deeply, as he gazed at her absorbed in her tasks. And yet&ndash;&ndash;how
was she born? Might he not, in the absence of definite
knowledge, accept Rosendo&rsquo;s belief&ndash;&ndash;accept it because of its
beautiful, haunting mystery&ndash;&ndash;that she, too, was miraculously
born of a virgin, and &ldquo;left by the angels on the river bank&rdquo;?
For, as far as he might judge, her life was sinless. It was true,
she did at rare intervals display little outbursts of childish
temper; she sometimes forgot and spoke sharply to her few
playmates, and even to Do&ntilde;a Maria; and he had seen her cry
for sheer vexation. And yet, these were but tiny shadows
that were cast at rarest intervals, melting quickly when they
came into the glorious sunlight of her radiant nature.</p>
<p>But the mystery shrouding the child&rsquo;s parentage, however
he might regard it, often roused within his mind thoughts dark
and apprehensive. Only one communication had come from
Padre Diego, and that some four months after his precipitous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page162' name='book2_page162'></a>162</span>
flight. He had gained the Guamoc&oacute; trail, it said, and finally
arrived at Remedios. He purposed returning to Banco ultimately;
and, until then, must leave the little Carmen in the
care of those in whom he had immovable confidence, and to
whom he would some day try, however feebly, to repay in an
appropriate manner his infinite debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; muttered Rosendo, on reading the note. &ldquo;Does
the villain think we are fools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But none the less could the old man quiet the fear that
haunted him, nor still the apprehension that some day Diego
would make capital of his claim. What that claim might accomplish
if laid before Wenceslas, he shuddered to think. And
so he kept the girl at his side when in Simit&iacute;, and bound Jos&egrave;
and the faithful Juan to redoubled vigilance when he was again
obliged to return to the mountains.</p>
<p>Time passed. The care-free children of this tropic realm
drowsed through the long, hot days and gossiped and danced
in the soft airs of night. Rosendo held his unremitting, lonely
vigil of toil in the ghastly solitudes of Guamoc&oacute;. Jos&egrave;, exiled
and outcast, clung desperately to the child&rsquo;s hand, and strove
to rise into the spiritual consciousness in which she dwelt.
And thus the year fell softly into the yawning arms of the
past and became a memory.</p>
<p>Then one day Simit&iacute; awoke from its lethargy in terror, with
the spectre of pestilence stalking through her narrow streets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 19</h2>
</div>
<p>Feliz Gomez, who had been sent to Bodega Central for
merchandise which Don Mario was awaiting from the
coast, had collapsed as he stepped from his boat on his
return to Simit&iacute;. When he regained consciousness he called
wildly for the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; he cried, when Jos&egrave; arrived, &ldquo;it is <i>la plaga</i>! Ah,
<i>Sant&iacute;sima Virgen</i>&ndash;&ndash;I am dying!&ndash;&ndash;dying!&rdquo; He writhed in
agony on the ground.</p>
<p>The priest bent over him, his heart throbbing with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The lad strove to raise his head. &ldquo;The innkeeper
at Bodega Central&ndash;&ndash;he told me I might sleep in an empty
house back of the inn. <i>Dios m&iacute;o!</i> There was an old cot there&ndash;&ndash;I
slept on it two nights&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba!</i> Padre, they told me then&ndash;&ndash;Ah,
<i>Bendita Virgen</i>! Don&rsquo;t let me die, Padre! <i>Car&iacute;sima Virgen</i>,
don&rsquo;t let me die! <i>Ah, Dios&ndash;&ndash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page163' name='book2_page163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>His body twisted in convulsions. Jos&egrave; lifted him and
dragged him to the nearby shed where the lad had been living
alone. A terror-stricken concourse gathered quickly about the
doorway and peered in wide-eyed horror through the narrow
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feliz, what did they tell you?&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, laying the
sufferer upon the bed and chafing his cold hands. The boy
rallied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me&ndash;&ndash;a Turk, bound for Zaragoza on the Nech&iacute;
river&ndash;&ndash;had taken the wrong boat&ndash;&ndash;in Maganguey. He had
been sick&ndash;&ndash;terribly sick there. <i>Ah, Dios!</i> It is coming again,
Padre&ndash;&ndash;the pain! <i>Caramba!</i> <i>Dios m&iacute;o!</i> Save me, Padre, save
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacinta! Rosa! I must have help!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, turning
to the stunned people. &ldquo;Bring cloths&ndash;&ndash;hot water&ndash;&ndash;and send for
Don Mario. Do&ntilde;a Lucia, prepare an <i>olla</i> of your herb tea at
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the boy had become quieter&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;when the Turk
learned that he was on the wrong boat&ndash;&ndash;he asked to be put off
at the next town&ndash;&ndash;which was Bodega Central. The innkeeper
put him in the empty house&ndash;&ndash;and he&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios</i>! he died&ndash;&ndash;on that
bed where I slept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, he died&ndash;&ndash;the day before I arrived there&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;ah<i>,
Sant&iacute;sima Virgen</i>! they said&ndash;&ndash;he died&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;<i>la c&oacute;lera</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cholera!&rdquo; cried the priest, starting up. At the mention of
the disease a loud murmur arose from the people, and they
fell back from the shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&ndash;&ndash;<i>ah, Dios</i>, how I suffer! Give me the sacrament&ndash;&ndash;I
cannot live&ndash;&ndash;! Padre&ndash;&ndash;let me confess&ndash;&ndash;now. Ah, Padre,
shall I go&ndash;&ndash;to heaven? Tell me&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s blood froze. He stood with eyes riveted in horror
upon the tormented lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the boy&rsquo;s voice grew weaker&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I fell sick that day&ndash;&ndash;I
started for Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;I died a thousand times in the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>ah,
caramba</i>! But, Padre&ndash;&ndash;promise to get me out of purgatory&ndash;&ndash;I
have no money for Masses. <i>Caramba!</i> I cannot stand it!
Oh, <i>Dios</i>! Padre&ndash;&ndash;quick&ndash;&ndash;I have not been very wicked&ndash;&ndash;but
I stole&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios</i>, how I suffer!&ndash;&ndash;I stole two pesos from the innkeeper
at Bodega Central&ndash;&ndash;he thought he lost them&ndash;&ndash;but I took
them out of the drawer&ndash;&ndash;Padre, pay him for me&ndash;&ndash;then I will
not go to hell! <i>Dios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo at that moment entered the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come in here!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, turning upon him in wild
apprehension. &ldquo;Keep away, for God&rsquo;s sake, keep away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In sullen silence Rosendo disregarded the priest&rsquo;s frenzied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page164' name='book2_page164'></a>164</span>
appeal. His eyes widened when he saw the boy torn with convulsions,
but he did not flinch. Only when he saw Carmen approaching,
attracted by the great crowd, he hastily bade one
of the women turn her back home.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the poor sufferer tossed and writhed.
Again and again he lapsed into unconsciousness, from which he
would emerge to piteously beg the priest to save him. <i>&ldquo;Ah!
Dios, Padre!&rdquo;</i> he pleaded, extending his trembling arms to
Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;can you do nothing? Can you not help me? <i>Sant&iacute;sima
Virgen</i>, how I suffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when the evening shadows were gathering, the final
convulsions seized him and wrenched his poor soul loose. Jos&egrave;
and Rosendo were alone with him when the end came. The
people had early fled from the stricken lad, and were gathering
in little groups before their homes and on the corners, discussing
in low, strained tones the advent of the scourge. Those
who had been close to the sick boy were now cold with fear.
Women wept, and children clung whimpering to their skirts.
The men talked excitedly in hoarse whispers, or lapsed into a
state of terrified dullness.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went from the death-bed to the Alcalde. Don Mario
saw him coming, and fled into the house, securing the door
after him. &ldquo;Go away, Padre!&rdquo; he shouted through the shutters.
&ldquo;For the love of the Virgin do not come here! <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Don Mario, the lad is dead!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; in desperation.
&ldquo;And what shall we do? We must face the situation.
Come, you are the Alcalde. Let us talk about&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> Do what you want to! I shall get out! <i>Nombre
de Dios!</i> If I live through the night I shall go to the mountains
to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must have a coffin to bury the lad! You must let
us have one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You cannot enter here, Padre!&rdquo; shrilled Don Mario,
jumping up and down in his excitement. &ldquo;Bury him in a
blanket&ndash;&ndash;anything&ndash;&ndash;but keep away from my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned sadly away and passed through the deserted
streets back to the lonely shed. Rosendo met him at the door.
&ldquo;<i>Bien, Padre</i>,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;we are exiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been home yet?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>, no! I cannot go home now. I might carry the
disease to the se&ntilde;ora and the little Carmen. I must stay here.
And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you too, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart turned to lead. &ldquo;But, the boy?&rdquo; he exclaimed,
pointing toward the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it is dark, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, &ldquo;we will take
him out through the back door and bury him beyond the
shales. <i>Hombre!</i> I must see now if I can find a shovel.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page165' name='book2_page165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank down upon the threshold, a prey to corroding despair,
while Rosendo went out in search of the implement. The
streets were dead, and few lights shone from the latticed windows.
The pall of fear had settled thick upon the stricken
town. Those who were standing before their houses as Rosendo
approached hastily turned in and closed their doors.
Jos&egrave;, in the presence of death in a terrible form, sat mute. In
an hour Rosendo returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shovel, Padre,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;But I crept up back
of my house and got this bar which I had left standing there
when I came back from the mountains. I can scrape up the
loose earth with my hands. Come now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; wearily rose. He was but a tool in the hands of a man
to whom physical danger was but a matter of temperament.
He absently helped Rosendo wrap the black, distorted corpse in
the frayed blanket; and then together they passed out into the
night with their grewsome burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not to the cemetery, Rosendo?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;, as the
old man took an opposite course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>, no!&rdquo; cried Rosendo. &ldquo;The cemetery is on shale,
and I could not dig through it in time. We must get the body
under ground at once. <i>Caramba!</i> If we put it in one of the
<i>b&oacute;vedas</i> in the cemetery the buzzards will eat it and scatter
the plague all over the town. The <i>b&oacute;vedas</i> are broken, and have
no longer any doors, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So beyond the shales they went, stumbling through the darkness,
their minds freighted with a burden of apprehension
more terrible than the thing they bore in their arms. The
shales crossed, Rosendo left the trail, cutting a way through
the bush with his <i>machete</i> a distance of several hundred feet.
Then, by the weird yellow light of a single candle, he opened
the moist earth and laid the hideous, twisted thing within. Jos&egrave;
watched the procedure in dull apathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, at length breaking the
awful silence, &ldquo;where will you sleep to-night? I cannot let
you go back to your house. It is too near the se&ntilde;ora and Carmen.
No man in town will let you stay in his house, since you
have handled the plague. Will you sleep in the shed where the
lad died? Or out on the shales with me? I called to the
se&ntilde;ora when I went after the bar, and she will lay two blankets
out in the <i>plaza</i> for us. And in the morning she will put food
where we can get it. What say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stood dazed. His mind had congealed with the horror
of the situation. Rosendo took him by the arm. &ldquo;Come, Padre,&rdquo;
he said gently. &ldquo;The hill up back of the second church is
high, and no one lives near. I will get the blankets and we
will pass the night out there.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page166' name='book2_page166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; found his voice. &ldquo;What is it? Is it&ndash;&ndash;<i>la
c&oacute;lera</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> Padre,&rdquo; returned Rosendo. &ldquo;There has been
plague here&ndash;&ndash;these people, some of them, still remember it&ndash;&ndash;but
it was long ago. There have been cases along the river&ndash;&ndash;and
brought, I doubt not, by Turks, like this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that it is now all along the river? That
Bodega Central is being ravaged by the scourge? That it will
sweep through the country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i> Padre. All I do know is that the people of
Simit&iacute; are terribly frightened, and the pestilence may wipe
away the town before it leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;good God! what can we do, Rosendo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Padre&ndash;&ndash;but stay and meet it,&rdquo; the man replied
quietly.</p>
<p>They reached the hill in silence. Then Rosendo wrapped
himself in one of the blankets which he had picked up as he
passed through the <i>plaza</i>, and lay down upon the shale.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; slept not that night. The warm, sluggish air lay
about him, mephitic in its touch. The great vampire bats that
soughed through it symbolized the &ldquo;pestilence that walketh in
darkness.&rdquo; Lonely calls drifted across the warm lake waters
from the dripping jungle like the hollow echoes of lost souls.
Rosendo tossed fitfully, and now and then uttered deep groans.
The atmosphere was prescient with horror. He struggled to
his feet and paced gloomily back and forth along the brow of
the hill. The second church stood near, deserted, gloomy, no
longer a temple of God, but a charnel house of fear and black
superstition. In the distance the ghostly white walls of the
Rinc&oacute;n church glowed faintly in the feeble light that dripped
from the yellow stars. There was now no thought of God&ndash;&ndash;no
thought of divine aid. Jos&egrave; was riding again the mountainous
billows of fear and unbelief; nor did he look for the Master to
come to him through the thick night across the heaving waters.</p>
<p>The tardy dawn brought Do&ntilde;a Maria to the foot of the hill,
where she deposited food, and held distant converse with
the exiles. Don Mario had just departed, taking the direction
across the lake toward San Lucas. He had compelled his wife
to remain in Simit&iacute; to watch over the little store, while he fled
with two boatmen and abundant supplies. Others likewise
were preparing to flee, some to the Boque river, some up the
Guamoc&oacute; trail. Do&ntilde;a Maria was keeping Carmen closely, nor
would she permit her to as much as venture from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should not the se&ntilde;ora take Carmen and go to Boque,
Rosendo?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Then you and I could occupy our
own houses until we knew what the future had in store for us.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page167' name='book2_page167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Rosendo agreed at once. Carmen would be safe in the protecting
care of Don Nicol&aacute;s. Do&ntilde;a Maria yielded only after
much persuasion. From the hilltop Jos&egrave; could descry the
Alcalde&rsquo;s boat slowly wending its way across the lake toward
the Juncal. Rosendo, having finished his morning meal, prepared
to meet the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the sun gets high we cannot
stay here. We must seek shade&ndash;&ndash;but where?&rdquo; He looked about
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not in the old church, Rosendo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, never!&rdquo; cried Rosendo. &ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> that old church
is haunted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; could never understand the nature of this man, so
brave in the face of physical danger, yet so permeated with
superstitious dread of those imaginary inhabitants of the invisible
realm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; suggested Rosendo at length. &ldquo;We will go down
there, nearer the lake, to the old shack where the blacksmith
had his forge. He died two years ago, and the place has since
been empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go then, Rosendo, and I will follow later,&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;,
who now craved solitude for the struggle for self-mastery
which he saw impending.</p>
<p>While Rosendo moved off toward the deserted shack, the
priest continued his restless pacing along the crest of the hill.
The morning was glorious&ndash;&ndash;but for the blighting thoughts of
men. The vivid green of the dewy hills shone like new-laid
color. The lake lay like a diamond set in emeralds. The dead
town glowed brilliantly white in the mounting sun. Jos&egrave; knew
that the heat would soon drive him from the hill. He glanced
questioningly at the old church. He walked toward it; then
mounted the broken steps. The hinges, rusted and broken, had
let the heavy door, now bored through and through by <i>comej&eacute;n</i>
ants, slip to one side. Through the opening thus afforded,
Jos&egrave; could peer into the cavernous blackness within. The sun
shot its terrific heat at him, and the stone steps burned his
sandaled feet. He pushed against the door. It yielded. Then
through the opening he entered the dusty, ill-smelling old
edifice.</p>
<p>When his eyes had become accustomed to the dimness within,
he saw that the interior was like that of the other church,
only in a more dilapidated state. There were but few benches;
and the brick altar, poorer in construction, had crumbled
away at one side. Dust, mold, and cobwebs covered everything;
but the air was gratefully cool. Jos&egrave; brushed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page168' name='book2_page168'></a>168</span>
thick dust from one of the benches. Then he lay down upon
it, and was soon sunk in heavy sleep.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The sun had just crossed the meridian. Jos&egrave; awoke, conscious
that he was not alone. The weird legend that hung
about the old church filtered slowly through his dazed brain.
Rosendo had said that an angel of some kind dwelt in the
place. And surely a presence sat on the bench in the twilight
before him! He roused up, rubbed his sleepy eyes, and peered
at it. A soft laugh echoed through the stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked all around for the bad angel that padre Rosendo
said lived here, and I didn&rsquo;t find anything but you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen, child! What are you doing here? Don&rsquo;t come
near me!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, drawing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre&ndash;&ndash;what is it? Why must I keep away from
you? First, madre Maria tells me I must go to Boque with
her. And now you will not let me come near you. And I love
you so&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Tears choked her voice, and she sat looking in
mute appeal at the priest.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s wit seemed hopelessly scattered. He passed his hand
dully across his brow as if to brush the mist from his befogged
brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo; The pathetic little voice wrung his heart.
&ldquo;Padre dear, when madre Maria told me I had to go to Boque,
I went to your house to ask you, and&ndash;&ndash;and you weren&rsquo;t there.
And I couldn&rsquo;t find padre Rosendo either&ndash;&ndash;and there wasn&rsquo;t
anybody in the streets at all&ndash;&ndash;and I came up here. Then I
saw the blanket out on the hill, and I kept hunting for you&ndash;&ndash;I
wanted to see you <i>so</i> much. And when I saw the door of
the church broken, I thought you might be in here&ndash;&ndash;and so I
came in&ndash;&ndash;and, oh, Padre dear, I was <i>so</i> glad to find you&ndash;&ndash;but
I wouldn&rsquo;t wake you up&ndash;&ndash;and while you were sleeping I just
<i>knew</i> that God was taking care of you all the time&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had sunk again upon the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear!&rdquo; Carmen came flying to him across the
darkness and threw her arms about his neck. &ldquo;Padre dear!
I just couldn&rsquo;t stand it to leave you!&rdquo; The flood-gates opened
wide, and the girl sobbed upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen&ndash;&ndash;child!&rdquo; But his own tears were mingling freely
with hers. The strain of the preceding night had left him
weak. He strove feebly to loosen the tightly clasped arms of
the weeping girl. Then he buried his drawn face in her thick
curls and strained her to his heaving breast. What this might
mean to Carmen he knew full well. But&ndash;&ndash;why not have it so?
If she preceded him into the dark vale, it would be for only a
little while. He would not live without her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page169' name='book2_page169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>The sobs died away, and the girl looked up at the suffering
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, you will not send me away&ndash;&ndash;will you?&rdquo; she
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;not now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A happy little sigh escaped her lips. Then she drew herself
closer to him and whispered softly, &ldquo;Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;I love
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan burst from the man. &ldquo;God above!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;have
you the heart to let evil attack such a one as this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up at him in wonder. &ldquo;Why, Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;what
is it? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, child&ndash;&ndash;nothing! Did&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;did your madre Maria
say why you must go to Boque?&rdquo; he asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said Feliz Gomez died last night of the plague, and
that the people were afraid they would all get sick and die
too. And she said&ndash;&ndash;Padre dear, she said you were afraid I
would get sick, and so you told her to take me away. You
didn&rsquo;t mean that, did you? She didn&rsquo;t understand you, did
she? You are not afraid, are you? You can&rsquo;t be, you know,
can you? You and I are not afraid of anything. We <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t
we, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we know, child?&rdquo; he asked sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why, we know that God is <i>everywhere</i>!&rdquo; She
looked at him wonderingly. What could she understand of a
nature so wavering?&ndash;&ndash;firm when the sun shone bright above&ndash;&ndash;tottering
when the blasts of adversity whirled about it? He
had said such beautiful things to her, such wonderful things
about God and His children only yesterday. And now&ndash;&ndash;why
this awful change? Why again this sudden lowering of
standards?</p>
<p>He had sunk deep into his dark thoughts. &ldquo;Death is inevitable!&rdquo;
he muttered grimly, forgetful of the child&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre dear!&rdquo; she pleaded, passing her little hand
tenderly over his cheek. Then her face brightened. &ldquo;I know
what it is!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You are just trying to think that
two and two are seven&ndash;&ndash;and you can&rsquo;t prove it&ndash;&ndash;and so you&rsquo;d
better stop trying!&rdquo; She broke into a little forced laugh.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sat wrapped in black silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo; Her voice was full of plaintive tenderness.
&ldquo;You have talked so much about that good man Jesus. What
would he say if he saw you trying to make two and two equal
seven? And if he had been here last night&ndash;&ndash;would he have
let Feliz die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest made no answer. None was required when
Carmen put her questions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page170' name='book2_page170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she continued softly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> cure
Feliz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His soul withered under the shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told me, often, that Jesus cured sick people.
And you said he even made the dead ones live again&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t
you, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;they say he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you read to me once from your Bible where he told
the people that he gave them power over everything. And you
said he was the great rule&ndash;&ndash;you called him the Christ-principle&ndash;&ndash;and
you said he never went away from us. Well, Padre
dear,&rdquo; she concluded with quick emphasis, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
use him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a moment. Then, when no reply came&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feliz didn&rsquo;t die, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> It&rsquo;s all the same&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he cried in a tone
of sullen bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he is gone, Padre dear. And Feliz thought he
had to go. And so now you both see it that way&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s all.
If you would see things the way that good man Jesus told you
to&ndash;&ndash;well, wouldn&rsquo;t they be different&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t they, Padre
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they would, child, no doubt. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a moment for him to express the limitation
which the conjunctive implied. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, how do you think he did it? How did he cure
sick people, and make the dead ones live again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know, child&ndash;&ndash;I am not sure. That knowledge
has been lost, long since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> know, Padre,&rdquo; she insisted; &ldquo;you <i>do</i>! Did he
know that God was everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say sickness was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He classed it with all evil under the one heading&ndash;&ndash;a lie&ndash;&ndash;a
lie about God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when a person tells a lie, he doesn&rsquo;t speak the truth,
does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lie has no rule, no principle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it isn&rsquo;t anything&ndash;&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t come from anything true&ndash;&ndash;hasn&rsquo;t
any real life, has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a lie is utterly unreal, not founded on anything but
supposition, either ignorant or malicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jesus said sickness was a supposition, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page171' name='book2_page171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And God, who made everything real, didn&rsquo;t make suppositions.
He made only real things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre dear, if you <i>know</i> all that, why don&rsquo;t you act
as if you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Act? Yes, act your knowledge! Acknowledge Him in all
your ways! Then He shall bring it to pass! What? That
which is real&ndash;&ndash;life, not death&ndash;&ndash;immortality, not oblivion&ndash;&ndash;love,
not hate&ndash;&ndash;good, not evil!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His voice was thick. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you believe all
that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre dear&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she smiled up at him through the darkness&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe it, I <i>know</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;how&ndash;&ndash;how do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God tells me, Padre. I hear Him, always. And I prove
it every day. The trouble is, you believe it, but I don&rsquo;t think
you ever try to <i>prove</i> it. If you believed my problems in
algebra could be solved, but never tried to prove it&ndash;&ndash;well, you
wouldn&rsquo;t do very much in algebra, would you?&rdquo; She laughed
at the apt comparison.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s straining eyes were peering straight ahead. Through
the thick gloom he saw the mutilated figure of the Christ hanging
on its cross beside the crumbling altar. It reflected the
broken image of the Christ-principle in the hearts of men.
And was he not again crucifying the gentle Christ? Did not
the world daily crucify him and nail him with their false beliefs
to the cross of carnal error which they set up in the
Golgotha of their own souls? And were they not daily paying
the awful penalty therefor? Aye, paying it in agony, in torturing
agony of soul and body, in blasted hopes, crumbling ambitions,
and inevitable death!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, what did the good man say sickness came
from?&rdquo; Carmen&rsquo;s soft voice brought him back from his reflections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sickness? Why, he always coupled disease with sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sin is&ndash;&ndash;is unrighteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; she pursued relentlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong conduct, based on wrong thinking. And wrong
thinking is based on wrong beliefs, false thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to believe that there is anything but God, and the
things He made, is sin, isn&rsquo;t it, Padre dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sin is&ndash;&ndash;yes, to believe in other powers than God is to
break the very first Commandment&ndash;&ndash;and that is the chief of
sins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre dear, can&rsquo;t you make yourself think right?
Do you know what you really think about God, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page172' name='book2_page172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; rose and paced up and down through the dark aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to think,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that He is mind; that He is
infinite, everywhere; that He is all-powerful; that He knows all
things; and that He is perfect and good. I try not to think
that He made evil, or anything that is or could be bad, or that
could become sick, or decay, or die. Whatever He made must
be real, and real things last forever, are immortal, eternal. I
strive to think He did make man in His image and likeness&ndash;&ndash;and
that man has never been anything else&ndash;&ndash;that man never
&lsquo;fell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an old, outworn theological belief. But, to resume:
I believe that, since God is mind, man must be an idea of His.
Since God is infinite, man must exist in Him. I know that any
number of lies can be made up about true things. And any
number of falsities can be assumed about God and what He
has made. I am sure that the material universe and man are
a part of the lie about God and the way He manifests and
expresses Himself in and through His ideas. Everything is
mental. We <i>must</i> hold to that! The mental realm includes
all truth, all fact. But there may be all sorts of supposition
about this fact. And yet, while fact is based upon absolute
and undeviating principle&ndash;&ndash;and I believe that principle to be
God&ndash;&ndash;supposition is utterly without any rule or principle whatsoever.
It is wholly subject to truth, to Principle, to God.
Hence, bad or wrong thought is absolutely subject to good or
real thought, and must go down before it. The mortal man is
a product of wrong thought. He is a supposition; and so is
the universe of matter in which he is supposed to live. We
have already learned that the things he thinks he hears, feels,
tastes, smells, and sees are only his own thoughts. And these
turn out to be suppositions. Hence, they are nothing real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre! How fast you talk! And&ndash;&ndash;such big words!
I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think I understand all you say. But, anyway, I
guess it is right.&rdquo; She laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> it is right!&rdquo; he exclaimed, forgetting that he was
talking to a child. &ldquo;Evil, which includes sickness and death,
is only a false idea of good. It is a misinterpretation, made in
the thought-activity which constitutes what we call the human
consciousness. And that is the opposite&ndash;&ndash;the suppositional
opposite&ndash;&ndash;of the mind that is God. Evil, then, becomes a supposition
and a lie. Just what Jesus said it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t act as if you really
believed all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear&ndash;&ndash;only fear! It has not yet been eradicated from my
thought,&rdquo; he answered slowly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page173' name='book2_page173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, what will drive it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, child&ndash;&ndash;love only, for &lsquo;perfect love casteth out fear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, Padre dear, I will just love it all out of you,
every bit!&rdquo; she exclaimed, clasping her arms about him again
and burying her face in his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, little one,&rdquo; he said sadly, &ldquo;I must love more. I must
love my fellow-men and good more than myself and evil. If
I didn&rsquo;t love myself so much, I would have no fear. If I loved
God as you do, dearest child, I would never come under fear&rsquo;s
heavy shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> love everybody&ndash;&ndash;you have got to, for you are God&rsquo;s
child. And now,&rdquo; she added, getting down and drawing him
toward the door, &ldquo;let us go out of this smelly old church. I
want you to come home. We&rsquo;ve got to have our lessons, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;child, the people will not let me come near them&ndash;&ndash;nor
you either, now,&rdquo; he said, holding back. &ldquo;They think we
may give them the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with a tender, wistful smile. Then
she shook her head. &ldquo;Padre dear, I love you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
you make me lots of trouble. But&ndash;&ndash;we are going to love all
the fear away, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; stamping her little bare foot&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we are
going to get the right answer to your problem, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest took her hand, and together they passed out
into the dazzling sunlight.</p>
<p>On the brow of the hill stood Rosendo, talking excitedly,
and with much vehement gesticulation, to Do&ntilde;a Maria, who
remained a safe distance from him. The latter and her good
consort exclaimed in horror when they saw Carmen with the
priest.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo;</i> cried Rosendo, darting toward them. &ldquo;I could
kill you for this, Padre! <i>Hombre!</i> How came the child here,
and with you? <i>Dios m&iacute;o!</i> Have you no heart, but that, when
you know you may die, you would take her with you?&rdquo; He
swung his long arms menacingly before the priest, and his
face worked with passion.</p>
<p>The girl ran between the two men. &ldquo;Padre Rosendo!&rdquo; she
cried, seizing one of his hands in both of her own. &ldquo;I came of
myself. He did not call me. I found him asleep. And he isn&rsquo;t
going to die&ndash;&ndash;nor I, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Maria approached and quietly joined the little group.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba! Go back!&rdquo;</i> cried the distressed Rosendo, turning
upon her. &ldquo;<i>Hombre! Dios y diablo!</i> will you all die?&rdquo;
He stamped the ground and tore his hair in his impotent protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Rosendo,&rdquo; said the woman placidly, &ldquo;if you are in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page174' name='book2_page174'></a>174</span>
danger, I will be too. If you must die, so will I. I will not be
left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thrill of admiration swept over the priest. Then he
smiled wanly. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have all been exposed to
the plague now, and we will stand together. Shall we return
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s anger soon evaporated, but his face retained
traces of deep anxiety. &ldquo;Maria tells me, Padre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
Amado Sanchez fell sick last night with the flux, and nobody
will stay with him, excepting his woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go to him, then,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Maria,
do you and Carmen return to your house, whilst Rosendo and
I seek to be of service to those who may need us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they started down the main street of the town.
Dead silence reigned everywhere. Many of the inhabitants had
fled to the hills. But there were still many whose circumstances
would not permit of flight. As they neared Rosendo&rsquo;s
house the little party were hailed from a distance by Juan
Mendoza and Pedro C&aacute;rdenas, neighbors living on either side
of Rosendo and the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hola</i>, Padre and Don Rosendo!&rdquo; they called; &ldquo;you cannot
return to your homes, for you would expose us to the plague!
Go back! Go back! We will burn the houses over your heads
if you return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>amigos</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Jos&egrave; began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre,&rdquo; they cried in tense excitement, &ldquo;it is for the
best! Go back to the hill! We will supply you with food and
blankets&ndash;&ndash;but you must not come here! Amado Sanchez is
sick; Guillermo Hernandez is sick. Go back! You must not
expose us!&rdquo; The attitude of the frightened, desperate men
was threatening. Jos&egrave; saw that it would be unwise to resist
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, compadres</i>, we will go,&rdquo; he said, his heart breaking
with sorrow for these children of fear. Then, assembling his
little family, he turned and retraced his steps sadly through
the street that burned in lonely silence in the torrid heat.</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s eyes were big with wonder; but a happy idea soon
drove all apprehension from her thought. &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;we will live in the old church, and we will play house
there!&rdquo; She clapped her hands in merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; muttered Rosendo. &ldquo;I will not enter that place!
It would bring the plague upon me! <i>Na! na!</i>&rdquo; he insisted,
when they reached the steps, &ldquo;do you go in if you wish; but
I will stay outside in the shadow of the building.&rdquo; Nor would
the combined entreaties of Carmen and Jos&egrave; induce him to
yield. Do&ntilde;a Maria calmly and silently prepared to remain
with him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page175' name='book2_page175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pull off the old door, Padre!&rdquo; cried Carmen excitedly.
&ldquo;And open all the shutters. Look! Look, Padre! There goes
the bad angel that padre Rosendo was afraid of!&rdquo; A number
of bats, startled at the noise and the sudden influx of light,
were scurrying out through the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the legion of demons which Jesus sent into the
swine,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I will tell you the story some day, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo;
he said, in answer to her look of inquiry.</p>
<p>The day passed quickly for the child, nor did she seem to
cast another thought in the direction of the cloud which hung
over the sorrowing town. At dusk, Mendoza and C&aacute;rdenas
came to the foot of the hill with food and blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amado Sanchez has just died,&rdquo; they reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;So soon? Why&ndash;&ndash;he fell sick only
yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre, he had been ailing for many days&ndash;&ndash;but it may
have been the plague just the same. Perhaps it was with us
before Feliz brought it. But we have not exposed ourselves
to the disease and&ndash;&ndash;Padre&ndash;&ndash;there is not a man in Simit&iacute; who
will bury Amado. What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; divined the man&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;<i>Bien, amigo</i>,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Go you back to your homes. To-night Rosendo and I will
come and bury him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; had sent Carmen and Do&ntilde;a Maria beyond the church,
that they might not hear the grewsome tidings. When the
men had returned to their homes, the little band on the hilltop
ate their evening meal in silence. Then a bench was swept
clean for Carmen&rsquo;s bed, for she insisted on sleeping in the
old church with Jos&egrave; when she learned that he intended to pass
the night there.</p>
<p>Again, as the heavy shadows were gathering, Jos&egrave; and Rosendo
descended into the town and bore out the body of Amado
Sanchez to a resting place beside the poor lad who had died the
day before. To a man of such delicate sensibilities as Jos&egrave;,
whose nerves were raw from continual friction with a world
with which he was ever at variance, this task was one of
almost unendurable horror. He returned to the old church
in a state bordering on collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; he murmured, as they seated themselves on the
hillside in the still night, &ldquo;I think we shall all die of the
plague. And it were well so. I am tired, utterly tired of striving
to live against such odds. <i>Bien</i>, let it come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, <i>compadre</i>!&rdquo; urged Rosendo, putting his great
arm about the priest&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;We must all go some time,
and perhaps now; but while we live let us live like men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not fear death?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page176' name='book2_page176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;what is it that the old history of mine says? &lsquo;Death
is not departing, but arriving.&rsquo; I am not afraid. But the little
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;I wish that she might live. She&ndash;&ndash;ah, Padre, she could
do much good in the world. <i>Bien</i>, we are all in the hands of
the One who brought us here&ndash;&ndash;and He will take us in the way
and at the time that He appoints&ndash;&ndash;is it not so, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; lapsed again into meditation. No, he could not say
that it was so. The thoughts which he had expressed to Carmen
that morning still flitted through his mind. The child was
right&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo&rsquo;s philosophy was that of resignation born of
ignorance. It was the despair of doubt. And he did not really
think that Carmen would be smitten of the plague. Something
seemed to tell him that it was impossible. But, on the other
hand, he would himself observe every precaution in regard to
her. No, he would not sleep in the church that night. He
had handled the body of the plague&rsquo;s second victim, and he
could not rest near the child. Perhaps exposure to the night
air and the heavy dews would serve to cleanse him. And so
he wrapped himself in the blanket which Do&ntilde;a Maria brought
from within the church, and lay down beside the faithful pair.</p>
<p>In the long hours of that lonely night Jos&egrave; lay beneath the
shimmering stars pondering, wondering. Down below in the
smitten town the poor children of his flock were eating their
hearts out in anxious dread and bitter sorrow. Was it through
any fault of theirs that this thing had come upon them, like a
bolt from a cloudless sky? No&ndash;&ndash;except that they were human,
mortal. And if the thing were real, it came from the mind
that is God; if unreal&ndash;&ndash;but it seemed real to these simple folk,
terribly so!</p>
<p>His heart yearned toward them as his thought penetrated
the still reaches of the night and hovered about their lonely
vigil. Yet, what had he to offer? What balm could he extend
to those wearing out weary hours on beds of agony below?
Religion? True religion, if they could but understand it; but
not again the empty husks of the faith that had been taught
them in the name of Christ! Where did scholastic theology
stand in such an hour as this? Did it offer easement from their
torture of mind and body? No. Strength to bear in patience
their heavy burden? No. Hope? Not of this life&ndash;&ndash;nay,
naught but the thread-worn, undemonstrable promise of a
life to come, if, indeed, they might happily avoid the pangs of
purgatory and the horrors of the quenchless flames of hell!
God, what had not the Church to answer for!</p>
<p>And yet, these ignorant children were but succumbing to
the evidence of their material senses&ndash;&ndash;though small good it
would do to tell them so! Could they but know&ndash;&ndash;as did Carmen&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page177' name='book2_page177'></a>177</span>
rejection of error and reception of truth meant
life&ndash;&ndash;ah, could they but know! Could he himself but know&ndash;&ndash;really
<i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;that God is neither the producer of evil, nor the
powerless witness of its ravages&ndash;&ndash;could he but understand and
prove that evil is not a self-existing entity, warring eternally
with God, what might he not accomplish! For Jesus had said:
&ldquo;These signs&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the cure of disease, the rout of death&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;shall
follow them that believe,&rdquo; that understand, that know. Why
could he not go down to those beds of torture and say with the
Christ: &ldquo;Arise, for God hath made thee whole&rdquo;? He knew
why&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he
that cometh of God must believe&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;must <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that He is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.&rdquo; The suffering
victims in the town below were asleep in a state of religious
dullness. The task of independent thinking was onerous to
such as they. Gladly did they leave it to the Church to do
their thinking for them. And thus did they suffer for the trust
betrayed!</p>
<p>But truth is omnipotent, and &ldquo;one with God is a majority.&rdquo;
Jesus gave few rules, but none more fundamental than that
&ldquo;with God all things are possible.&rdquo; Was he, Jos&egrave;, walking
with God? If so, he might arise and go down into the stricken
town and bid its frightened children be whole. If he fully
recognized &ldquo;the Father&rdquo; as all-powerful, all-good, and if he
could clearly see and retain his grasp on the truth that evil,
the supposititious opposite of good, had neither place nor
power, except in the minds of mortals receptive to it&ndash;&ndash;ah, then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A soft patter of little feet on the shales broke in upon his
thought. He turned and beheld Carmen coming through the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you come and
sleep in the church with me?&rdquo; She crept close to him. He
had not the heart nor the courage to send her away. He put
out his arm and drew her to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; the child murmured, &ldquo;it is nice out here
under the stars&ndash;&ndash;and I want to be with you&ndash;&ndash;I love you&ndash;&ndash;love
you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The whisper died away, and the child slept on his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect love casteth out fear.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 20</h2>
</div>
<p>Dawn brought Juan Mendoza and Pedro C&aacute;rdenas again to
the hill, and with them came others. &ldquo;Mateo Gil, Pablo
Polo, and Juanita Gomez are sick, Padre,&rdquo; announced
Mendoza, the spokesman. &ldquo;They ask for the last sacrament.
You could come down and give it to them, and then return to
the hill, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre,&rdquo; continued Mendoza, &ldquo;we talked it over last
night, after Amado Sanchez died, and we think it would help
if you said a Mass for us in the church to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so this afternoon, after I have visited the sick,&rdquo;
he replied pityingly.</p>
<p>Mendoza hesitated. Then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think, too, Padre, that if we held a procession&ndash;&ndash;in
honor of Santa Barbara&ndash;&ndash;perhaps she would pray for us, and
might stop the sickness. We could march through the town
this evening, while you stood here and prayed as we passed
around the hill. What say you, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; was about to express a vehement protest. But the
anxious faces directed toward him melted his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, children,&rdquo; he replied gently, &ldquo;do as you wish. Keep
your houses this afternoon while I visit the sick and offer the
Mass. I will leave the <i>hostia</i> on the altar. You need not fear
to touch it. Carry it with you in your rogation to Santa Barbara
this evening, and I will stand here and pray for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people departed, sorrowing, but grateful. Hope revived
in the breasts of some. But most of them awaited in trembling
the icy touch of the plague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, when the people had gone. &ldquo;I have
been thinking about the sickness, and I remember what my
father told me he learned from a Jesuit missionary. It was
that the fat from a human body would cure rheumatism. And
then the missionary laughed and said that the fat from a
plump woman would cure all diseases of mind and body. If
that is so, Padre, and Juanita Gomez dies&ndash;&ndash;she is very plump,
Padre&ndash;&ndash;could we not take some of the fat from her body and
rub it on the sick&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above, Rosendo! what are you saying!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;
recoiling in horror.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo;</i> retorted the honest man. &ldquo;Would you not try
everything that might possibly save these people? What the
missionary said may be true.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page179' name='book2_page179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, my faithful ally,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;You did not get the
sense in which he said it. Neither human fat nor medicine of
any kind will help these people. Nothing will be accomplished
for them until their fear has been removed. For, I&ndash;&ndash;well, the
symptoms manifested by poor Feliz may have been those of
Asiatic cholera. But&ndash;&ndash;I begin to doubt. And as for Sanchez&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
we do not know&ndash;&ndash;not for certain.&rdquo; He stopped and
pondered the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; pursued Rosendo, &ldquo;I have used the liver of a
lizard for toothache, and it was very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;, with a smile.
&ldquo;And in days past stranger remedies than that were used by
supposedly wise people. When the eyesight was poor, they
rubbed wax from the human ear upon the eyes, and I doubt
not marvelous restorations of sight were made. So also dogs&rsquo;
teeth were ground into powder and taken to alleviate certain
bodily pains. Almost everything that could be swallowed has
been taken by mankind to cure their aches and torments. But
they still ache to-day; and will continue to do so, I believe,
until their present state of mind greatly changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the simple midday meal of corn <i>arepa</i> and black
coffee was finished, Jos&egrave; descended into the quiet town. &ldquo;It is
absurd that we should be kept on the hill,&rdquo; he had said to
Rosendo, &ldquo;but these dull, simple minds believe that, having
handled those dead of the plague, we have become agents of
infection. They forget that they themselves are living either in
the same house with it, or closely adjacent. But it humors
them, poor children, and we will stay here for their sakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> and they have made us their sextons!&rdquo; muttered
Rosendo.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; shuddered. The clammy hand of fear again reached
for his heart. He turned to Carmen, who was busily occupied
in the shade of the old church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lessons, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo; he queried, going to her for a
moment&rsquo;s abstraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre dear,&rdquo; she replied, smiling up at him, while
she quickly concealed the bit of paper on which she had been
writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing, little one?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t always make me tell you everything,&rdquo;
she pleaded, but only half in earnest, as she cast an
enigmatical glance at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this time I insist on knowing; so you might as well
tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, if you must know,&rdquo; she replied, her face beaming
with a happiness which seemed to Jos&egrave; strangely out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page180' name='book2_page180'></a>180</span>
place in that tense atmosphere, &ldquo;I have been writing a question
to God.&rdquo; She held out the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writing a question to God! Well&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Padre dear. I have done that for a long, long
time. When I want to know what to do, and think I don&rsquo;t see
just what is best, I write my question to God on a piece of
paper. Then I read it to Him, and tell Him I know He knows
the answer and that He will tell me. And then I put the paper
under a stone some place, and&ndash;&ndash;well, that&rsquo;s all, Padre. Isn&rsquo;t
it a good way?&rdquo; She beamed at him like a glorious noonday
sun.</p>
<p>The priest stood before her in wonder and admiration.
&ldquo;And does He tell you the answers to your questions, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;
he asked tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, Padre dear. Not always right away&ndash;&ndash;but He never
fails&ndash;&ndash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what you are asking Him now?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She handed him the paper. His eyes dimmed as he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear Father, please tell your little girl and her dear Padre Jos&egrave;
what it is that makes the people think they have to die down in the town.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And where will you put the paper, little girl?&rdquo; he asked,
striving to control his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know, Padre. Oh, why not put it under the
altar in this old church?&rdquo; she exclaimed, pleased with the
thought of such a novel hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;; and together they entered the
building. After much stumbling over rubbish, much soiling of
hands and disturbing of bats and lizards, while Carmen&rsquo;s happy
laugh rang merrily through the gloomy old pile, they laid the
paper carefully away behind the altar in a little pocket, and
covered it with an adobe brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; panted the girl, the task finished. &ldquo;Now we will
wait for the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went down into the ominous silence of the town with
a lighter heart. The sublime faith of the child moved before
him like a beacon. To the sick he spoke words of comfort,
with the vision of Carmen always before him. At the altar in
the empty church, where he offered the Mass in fulfillment of
his promise to the people, her fair form glowed with heavenly
radiance from the pedestal where before had stood the dilapidated
image of the Virgin. He prepared the sacred wafer and
left a part of it on the altar for the people to carry in their
procession to Santa Barbara. The other portion he took to the
sick ones who had asked for the sacrament.</p>
<p>Two more had fallen ill that afternoon. Mateo Gil, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page181' name='book2_page181'></a>181</span>
thought, could not live the night through. He knelt at the
loathsome bedside of the suffering man and prayed long and
earnestly for light. He tried not to ask, but to know. While
there, he heard a call from the street, announcing the passing
of Guillermo Hernandez. Another one! His heart sank again.
The plague was upon them in all its cruel virulence.</p>
<p>Sadly he returned to the hill, just as the sun tipped the
highest peaks of the <i>Cordilleras</i>. Standing on the crest, he
waited with heavy heart, while the mournful little procession
wended its sad way through the streets below. An old, battered
wooden image of one of the Saints, rescued from the
oblivion of the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i>, had been dressed to represent Santa
Barbara. This, bedecked with bits of bright colored ribbon,
was carried at the head of the procession by the faithful Juan.
Following him, Pedro Gonzales, old and tottering, bore a dinner
plate, on which rested the <i>hostia</i>, while over the wafer a
tall young lad held a soiled umbrella, for there was no canopy.</p>
<p>A slow chant rose from the lips of the people like a dirge.
It struck the heart of the priest like a chill wind. <i>&ldquo;Ora pro
nobis! Ora pro nobis!&rdquo;</i> Tears streamed from his eyes while
he gazed upon his stricken people. Slowly, wearily, they
wound around the base of the hill, some sullen with despair,
others with eyes turned beseechingly upward to where the
priest of God stood with outstretched hands, his full heart
pouring forth a passionate appeal to Him to turn His light
upon these simple-minded children. When they had gone back
down the road, their bare feet raising a cloud of thick dust
which hid them from his view, Jos&egrave; sank down upon the rock
and buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;I think I know, oh, God,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;but
as yet I have not proved&ndash;&ndash;not yet. But grant that I may soon&ndash;&ndash;for
their sakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo touched his shoulder. &ldquo;There is another body to
bury to-night, Padre. Eat now, and we will go down.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Standing over the new grave, in the solemn hush of night,
the priest murmured: &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo;
But the mound upon which Rosendo was stolidly heaping the
loose earth marked only another victory of the mortal law of
death over a human sense of life. And there was no one there
to call forth the sleeping man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I give you power over all things,&rdquo; said the marvelous
Jesus. The wondrous, irresistible power which he exerted
in behalf of suffering humanity, he left with the world
when he went away. But where is it now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still here,&rdquo; sighed the sorrowing priest, &ldquo;still here&ndash;&ndash;lo,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page182' name='book2_page182'></a>182</span>
always here&ndash;&ndash;but we know it not. Sunken in materiality, and
enslaved to the false testimony of the physical senses, we lack
the spirituality that alone would enable us to grasp and use
that Christ-power, which is the resurrection and the life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, when they turned back toward the
hill, &ldquo;Hernandez is now with the angels. You gave him the
sacrament, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosendo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, then you remitted his sins, and he is doubtless in
paradise. But,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;it may be that he had first to pass
through purgatory. <i>Caramba!</i> I like not the thought of those
hot fires!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave; in impatience. &ldquo;Your mental
wanderings at times are puerile! You talk like the veriest
child! Do not be deceived, Hernandez is still the same man,
even though he has left his earthly body behind. Do not think
he has been lifted at once into eternal bliss. The Church has
taught such rubbish for ages, and has based its pernicious
teachings upon the grossly misunderstood words of Jesus. The
Church is a failure&ndash;&ndash;a dead, dead failure, in every sense of the
word! And that man lying there in his grave is a ghastly proof
of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo looked wonderingly at the excited priest, whose
bitter words rang out so harshly on the still night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church has failed utterly to preserve the simple
gospel of the Christ! It has basely, wantonly betrayed its traditional
trust! It has fought and slain and burned for centuries
over trivial, vulnerable non-essentials, and thrown its
greatest pearls to the swine! It no longer prophesies; it carps
and reviles! It no longer heals the sick; but it conducts a
purgatorial lottery at so much a head! It has become a jumble
of idle words, a mumbling of silly formul&aelig;, a category of
stupid, insensate ceremonies! Its children are taught to derive
their faith from such legends as that of the holy Saint Francis,
who, to convince a heretic, showed the <i>hostia</i> to an ass, which
on beholding the sacred dough immediately kneeled! Good
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca-ram-ba!</i> But you speak hard words, Padre!&rdquo; muttered
Rosendo, vague speculations flitting through his brain as to the
priest&rsquo;s mental state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; continued Jos&egrave; heatedly, &ldquo;the Church has fought
truth desperately ever since the Master&rsquo;s day! It has fawned
at the feet of emperor and plutocrat, and licked the bloody
hand of the usurer who tossed her a pittance of his foul gains!
In the great world-battles for reform, for the rights of man,
for freedom from the slavery of man to man or to drink and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page183' name='book2_page183'></a>183</span>
drugs, she has come up only as the smoke has cleared away,
but always in time to demand the spoils! She has filched from
the systems of philosophy of every land and age, and after bedaubing
them with her own gaudy colors, has foisted them
upon unthinking mankind as divine decrees and mandates!
She has foully insulted God and man!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, Padre! You are not well! <i>Hombre</i>, we must
get back to the hill! You are falling sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, Rosendo! You voice the Church&rsquo;s stock complaint
of every man who exposes her shams: &lsquo;He hath a
devil!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo whistled softly. Jos&egrave; went on more excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask if Hernandez is in paradise or purgatory. He
is in a state no better nor worse than our own, for both are
wholly mental. We are now in the fires of as great a purgatory
as any man can ever experience! Yes, there is a purgatory&ndash;&ndash;right
here on earth&ndash;&ndash;and it follows us after death, and after
every death that we shall die, until we learn to know God and
see Him as infinite good, without taint or trace of evil! The
flames of hell are eternal to us as long as we eat of &lsquo;the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;as long as we believe in
other powers than God&ndash;&ndash;as long as we believe sin and disease
and evil to be as real and as potent as good! When we know
these things as awful human illusions, and when we recognize
God as the infinite mind that did not create evil, and does not
know or behold it, then, and then only, will the flames of
purgatory and hell in this state of consciousness which we
mistakenly call life, and in the states of consciousness still to
come, begin to diminish in intensity, and finally die out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked along in silence for some moments. Then he
turned to Rosendo and put his hand affectionately upon the
old man&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; he said more calmly,
&ldquo;I speak with intense feeling, for I have suffered much through
the intolerance, the unspirituality, and the worldly ambition
of the agents of Holy Church. I suffer, because I see what
she is, and how widely she has missed the mark. But, worse,
I see how blindly, how cruelly, she leads and betrays her trusting
children&ndash;&ndash;and it is the thought of that which at times
almost drives me mad! But never mind me, Rosendo. Let me
rave. My full heart must empty itself. Do you but look to
Carmen for your faith. She is not of the Church. She knows
God, and she will lead you straight to Him. And as you follow
her, your foolish ideas of purgatory, hell, and paradise, of
wafers and virgins&ndash;&ndash;all the tawdry beliefs which the Church
has laid upon you, will drop off, one by one, and melt away as
do the mists on the lake when the sun mounts high.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page184' name='book2_page184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>Carmen and Do&ntilde;a Maria sat against the wall of the old
church, waiting for them. The child ran through the darkness
and grasped Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep until you came, Padre!&rdquo; she cried
happily. &ldquo;I wanted to be sure you wouldn&rsquo;t sleep anywhere
else than right next to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; admonished Rosendo anxiously, &ldquo;do you think
you ought to let her come close to you now? The plague&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned to him and spoke low. &ldquo;There is no power
or influence that we can exert upon her, Rosendo, either for
good or evil. She is obeying a spiritual law of which we know
but little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, Rosendo: <i>&lsquo;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
whose mind is stayed on thee.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late moon peeped timidly above the drowsing treetops.
Its yellow beams stole silently across the still lake and
up the hillside to the crumbling church. When they reached
the four quiet figures, huddled close against the ghostly wall,
they filtered like streams of liquid gold through the brown
curls of the little head lying on the priest&rsquo;s shoulder. And
there they dwelt as symbols of Love&rsquo;s protecting care over the
trusting children of this world, until the full dawn of the
glorious sun of Truth.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 21</h2>
</div>
<p>Jos&egrave; rose from his hard bed stiff and weary. Depression
sat heavily upon his soul, and he felt miserably unable to
meet the day. Do&ntilde;a Maria was preparing the coffee over
a little fire back of the church. The odor of the steaming
liquid drifted to him on the warm morning air and gave him
a feeling of nausea. A sharp pain shot through his body. His
heart stopped. Was the plague&rsquo;s cold hand settling upon him?
Giddiness seized him, and he sat down again upon the rocks.</p>
<p>In the road below a cloud of dust was rising, and across
the distance a murmur of voices floated up to his ears. Men
were approaching. He wondered dully what additional trouble
it portended. Rosendo came to him at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muy buenos dias, Padre.</i> I saw a boat come across the
lake some minutes ago. I wonder if Don Mario has returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men below were ascending the hill. Jos&egrave; struggled to
his feet and went forth to meet them. A familiar voice greeted
him cheerily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page185' name='book2_page185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hola, Se&ntilde;or Padre Jos&egrave;!</i> <i>Dios m&iacute;o</i>, but your hill is steep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; strained his eyes at the newcomer. The man quickly
gained the summit, and hurried to grasp the bewildered priest&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love of the Virgin! don&rsquo;t you know me, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>?&rdquo;
he cried, slapping Jos&egrave; roundly upon the back.</p>
<p>The light of recognition slowly came into the priest&rsquo;s eyes.
The man was Don Jorge, his erstwhile traveling companion on
the Magdalena river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now a cup of that coffee, if you will do me the favor,
my good <i>Cura</i>. And then tell me what ails you here,&rdquo; he
added, seating himself. &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, what a town! Diego was
right&ndash;&ndash;the devil himself made this place! But they say you
have all taken to dying! Have you nothing else to do?
<i>Caramba</i>, I do not wonder! Such a God-forsaken spot! Well,
what is it? Speak, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; collected his scattered thoughts. &ldquo;The cholera!&rdquo; he
said hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cholera! <i>Caramba!</i> so they told me down below, and I
would not believe them! But where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our men brought it from Bodega Central.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bodega Central!&rdquo; ejaculated Don Jorge. &ldquo;Impossible! I
came from there this morning myself. Have been there two
days. There isn&rsquo;t a trace of cholera in the place, as far as I
know! You have all gone crazy&ndash;&ndash;but small wonder!&rdquo; looking
out over the decrepit town.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s head was awhirl. He felt his senses leaving
him. His ears were reporting things basely false. &ldquo;You say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
he began in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say what I have said, <i>amigo</i>! There is no more cholera
in Bodega Central than there is in heaven! I arrived there
day before yesterday, and left before sunrise this morning. So
I should know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank weakly down at the man&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Don
Jorge&ndash;&ndash;Feliz Gomez returned from there three nights ago, and
reported that a Turk, who had come up from the coast, had
died of the plague!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge&rsquo;s brows knit in perplexity. &ldquo;I recall now,&rdquo; he
said slowly, after some moments of study. &ldquo;The innkeeper
did say that a Turk had died there&ndash;&ndash;some sort of intestinal
trouble, I believe. When I told him I was bound for Simit&iacute;, he
laughed as if he would split, and then began to talk about the
great fright he had given a man from here. Said he scared
the fellow until his black face turned white. But I was occupied
with my own affairs, and paid him little attention. But
come, tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page186' name='book2_page186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>With the truth slowly dawning upon his clouded thought,
Jos&egrave; related the grewsome experiences of the past three days.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Ca-ram-ba!&rdquo;</i> Don Jorge whistled softly. &ldquo;Who would
have thought it! But, was Feliz Gomez sick before he went to
Bodega Central?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; interposed Rosendo. &ldquo;He and Amado Sanchez
both had bowel trouble. Their women told my wife so,
after you and I, Padre, had come up here to the hill. But it
was nothing. We have it here often, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;but we have never given it any
serious thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge leaned back and broke into a roar of laughter.
&ldquo;<i>Por el amor del cielo!</i> You are all crazy, <i>amigo</i>&ndash;&ndash;you die
like rats of fear! Did you ever put a mouse into a bottle and
then scare it to death with a loud noise? <i>Hombre!</i> That is
what has happened to you!&rdquo; The hill reverberated with his
loud shouts.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; could not share in the merriment. The awful consequences
of the innkeeper&rsquo;s coarse joke upon the childish
minds of these poor, impressionable people pressed heavily
upon his heart. Bitter tears welled to his eyes. He sprang to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Rosendo!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We must go down and tell
these people the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge joined them, and they all hastened down into
the town. Ramona Chaves met them in the <i>plaza</i>, her eyes
streaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;my man Pedro has the sickness! He
is dying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind, Ramona!&rdquo; loudly cried Jos&egrave;; &ldquo;there
is no cholera here!&rdquo; He hastened to the bedside of the writhing
Pedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, man!&rdquo; he shouted, seizing his hand. &ldquo;Up! You are
not sick! There is no cholera in Simit&iacute;! There is none in
Bodega Central! Feliz did not bring it! He and Amado had
only a touch of the flux, and they died of fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s ringing words acted upon the man like magic.
He roused up from his lethargy and stared at the assemblage.
Don Jorge repeated the priest&rsquo;s words, and added his own
laughing and boisterous comments. Pedro rose from his bed,
and stood staring.</p>
<p>Together, their little band augmented at every corner by
the startled people, they hurried to the homes of all who lay
upon beds of sickness, spreading the glad tidings, until the
little town was in a state of uproar. Like black shadows before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page187' name='book2_page187'></a>187</span>
the light, the plague fled into the realm of imagination from
which it had come. By night, all but Mateo Gil were up and
about their usual affairs. But even Mateo had revived wonderfully;
and Jos&egrave; was confident that the good news would be
the leaven of health that would work a complete restoration
within him in time. The exiles left the hilltop and the old
church, and returned again to their homes. Don Jorge took
up his abode with Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said, as they sat at the rear door of the priest&rsquo;s
house, looking through the late afternoon haze out over the
lake, &ldquo;you have had a strange experience&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! most
strange!&ndash;&ndash;and yet one from which you should gather an excellent
lesson. You are dealing with children here&ndash;&ndash;children
who have always been rocked in the cradle of the Church.
But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; looking archly at Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;do I offend? For, as I told
you on the boat a year ago, I do not think you are a good
priest.&rdquo; He laughed softly. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I will correct
that. You are good&ndash;&ndash;but not a priest, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some views, Don Jorge, which differ radically from
those of the faith,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; said cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> I should hope so!&rdquo; his friend ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Jos&egrave;, anxious to direct the conversation
into other channels, &ldquo;may I ask how and where you have occupied
yourself since I left the boat at Badillo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>Dios</i>!&rdquo; said Don Jorge, shaking his head, although his
eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I have wandered ever since&ndash;&ndash;and am poorer
now than when I started. I left our boat at Puerto Nacional,
to go to Medellin; and from there to Remedios and Guamoc&oacute;.
But while in the river town I met another <i>guaquero</i>&ndash;&ndash;grave
hunter, you know&ndash;&ndash;who was preparing to go to Honda, to
investigate the &lsquo;castles&rsquo; at that place. There is a strange legend&ndash;&ndash;you
may have heard it&ndash;&ndash;hanging over those rocks. It appears
that a lone hermit lived in one of the many caverns in
the great limestone deposits rising abruptly from the river
near the town of Honda. How he came there, no one knew.
Day after day, year after year, he labored in his cave, extending
it further into the hillside. People laughed at him for
tunneling in that barren rock, for gold has never been found
anywhere in it. But the fellow paid them no attention; and
gradually he was accepted as a harmless fanatic, and was left
unmolested to dig his way into the hill as far as he would.
Years passed. No one knew how the fellow lived, for he held
no human intercourse. Kind people often brought food and
left it at the mouth of his cavern, but he would have none of
it. They brought clothes, but they rotted where they were left.
What he ate, no one could discover. At last some good soul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page188' name='book2_page188'></a>188</span>
planted a fig tree near the cave, hoping that the fruit in time
would prove acceptable to him. One day they found the tree
cut down. <i>Bien</i>, time passed, and he was forgotten. One day
some men, passing the cave, found his body, pale and thin,
with long, white hair, lying at the entrance. But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>!
when they buried the body they found it was that of a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to draw some leaves of tobacco from his wallet
and roll a thick cigar. The sudden turn of his story drew an
expression of amazement from the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;where the woman came from, and
who she was, never was learned. Nor how she lived. But of
course some one must have supplied her with food and clothes
all these years. Perhaps she was some grand dame, with a
dramatic past, who had come there to escape the world and
do penance for her sins. What sorrow, what black tragedy
that cave concealed, no one may ever know! Nor am I at all
interested in that. The point is, either she found gold there,
or had a quantity of it that she brought with her&ndash;&ndash;at least so
I thought at the time. So, when the <i>guaquero</i> at Puerto Nacional
told me the story, nothing would do but I must go with
him to search the cave. <i>Caramba!</i> We wasted three full
months prying around there&ndash;&ndash;and had our labor for our
pains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tilted his chair back and puffed savagely at his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I got on the windy side of another legend, a
wild tale of buried treasure in the vicinity of Mompox. Of
course I hurried after it. Spent six months pawing the hot dirt
around that old town. Fell in with your estimable citizen,
Don Felipe, who swindled me out of a hundred good <i>pesos oro</i>
on a fraudulent location and a forged map. Then I cursed him
and the place and went up to Banco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banco!&rdquo; Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart began beating rapidly. Don Jorge
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your genial friend Diego is back there. Told me about
his trip to Simit&iacute; to see his little daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say about her, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave; in a controlled
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much&ndash;&ndash;only that he expected to send for her soon.
You know, Rosendo&rsquo;s daughter is living with him. Fine looking
wench, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Don Jorge,&rdquo; pursued Jos&egrave; anxiously, &ldquo;what think
you, is the little Carmen Diego&rsquo;s child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> How should I know? He no doubt has many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not look like him,&rdquo; asserted Jos&egrave;, clinging to his
note of optimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And fortunate she is in that! <i>Caramba</i>, but he looks
like an imp from sheol!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page189' name='book2_page189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; saw that little consolation was to be derived from
Don Jorge as far as Carmen was concerned. So he allowed
the subject to lapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; continued Don Jorge, whose present volubility was
in striking contrast to his reticence on the boat the year before,
&ldquo;I had occasion to come up to Bodega Central&ndash;&ndash;another
legend, if I must confess it. And there Don Carlos Noros&iacute;
directed me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt it appears so to you, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; replied
Don Jorge. &ldquo;And yet my business, that of treasure hunting,
has in times past proved very lucrative. The Indian graves of
Colombia have yielded enormous quantities of gold. The
Spaniards opened many of them; and in one, that of a famous
chieftain, discovered down below us, near Zaragoza, they found
a solid gold pineapple, a marvelous piece of workmanship, and
of immense value. They sent it to the king of Spain. <i>Caramba</i>!
it never would have reached him if I had been there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;we have no idea of the amount of
treasure that has been buried in various parts of Colombia.
This country has been, and still is, enormously rich in minerals&ndash;&ndash;a
veritable gold mine of itself. And since the time of the
Spanish conquest it has been in a state of almost constant
turmoil. Nothing and nobody has been safe. And, up to very
recent times, whenever the people collected a bit of gold above
their daily needs, they promptly banked it with good Mother
Earth. Then, like as not, they got themselves killed in the
wars, and the treasure was left for some curious and greedy
hunter like myself to dig up years after. The Royalists and
Tories buried huge sums all over the country during the War
of Independence. Why, it was only a year or so ago that two
men came over from Spain and went up the Magdalena river
to Bucaramanga. They were close-mouthed fellows, well-dressed,
and evidently well-to-do. But they had nothing to say
to anybody. The innkeeper pried around until he discovered
that they spent much time in their room poring over maps and
papers. Then they set off alone, with an outfit of mules and
supplies to last several weeks. <i>Bueno</i>, they came back at last
with a box of good size, made of mahogany, and bound around
with iron bands. <i>Caramba!</i> They did not tarry long, you may
be sure. And I learned afterward that they sailed away safely
from Cartagena, box and all, for sunny Spain, where, I doubt
not, they are now living in idleness and gentlemanly ease on
what they found in the big coffer they dug up near that old
Spanish city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; listened eagerly. To him, cooped up for a year and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page190' name='book2_page190'></a>190</span>
more in the narrow confines of Simit&iacute;, the ready flow of this
man&rsquo;s conversation was like a fountain of sparkling water to
a thirsty traveler. He urged him to go on, plying him with
questions about his strange avocation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, but the old Indian chiefs were wise fellows!&rdquo;
Don Jorge pursued. &ldquo;They seemed to know that greedy vandals
like myself would some day poke around in their last resting
places for the gold that was always buried with them&ndash;&ndash;possibly
to pay their freight across the dark river. And so
they dug their graves in the form of an L, in the extreme tip
of which the royal carcasses were laid. In this way they have
deceived many a grave-hunter, who dug straight down without
finding the body, which was safely tucked away in the toe of
the L. I have gone back and reopened many a grave that I had
abandoned as empty, and found His Royal Highness five or six
feet to one side of the straight shaft I had previously sunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; mused Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;that you now follow this work
because of its fascination&ndash;&ndash;for you must have found and laid
aside much treasure in the years that you have pursued it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo;</i> ejaculated the <i>guaquero</i>. &ldquo;I have been rich
and poor, like the rising and setting of the sun! What I find,
I spend again hunting more. It is the way of the world. The
man who has enough money never knows it. And his greed for
more&ndash;&ndash;more that he needs not, and cannot possibly spend on
himself&ndash;&ndash;generally results, as in my case, in the loss of what
he already has. But there are reasons aside from the excitement
of the chase that keep me at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell strangely silent, and Jos&egrave; knew that there were
aroused within him memories that seared the tissues of the
brain as they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>,&rdquo; Don Jorge resumed. His voice was low, tense
and cold. &ldquo;There are some things which I am trying to forget.
This exciting and dangerous business of mine keeps my
thought occupied. I care nothing now for the treasure I may
discover. But I crave forgetfulness. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, good friend,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; quickly; &ldquo;and I ask
pardon for recalling those things to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;De nada, amigo!&rdquo;</i> said Don Jorge, with a gesture of deprecation.
Then: &ldquo;I told you on the boat that I had lost a wife
and girl. The Church got them both. I tell you this because
I know you, too, have grievances against her. <i>Caramba!</i> Yet
I will tell you only a part. I lived in Maganguey, where my
wife&rsquo;s brother kept a store and did an excellent commission
business. I was mining and hunting graves in the Cauca region,
sometimes going up the Magdalena, too, and working
on both sides of the river. Maganguey was a convenient place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page191' name='book2_page191'></a>191</span>
for me to live, as it stands at the junction of the two great
rivers. Besides, my wife wished to remain near her own people.
<i>Bien</i>, we had a daughter. She grew up fair and good.
And then, one day, the priest told my wife that the girl was
destined to a great future, and must enter a convent and consecrate
herself to the Church. <i>Caramba!</i> I am not a Catholic&ndash;&ndash;was
never one! My parents were patriots, and both took
part in the great war that gave liberty to this country. But
they were liberal in thought; and I was never confirmed to the
Church. <i>Bien</i>, the priest made my life a hell&ndash;&ndash;my wife became
estranged from me&ndash;&ndash;and one day, returning from the Cauca,
I found my house deserted. Wife and girl and the child&rsquo;s nurse
had gone down the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face darkened, and hard lines drew around his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had taken my money chest, some thousands of pesos.
I sought the priest. He laughed at me, and&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! I struck
him such a blow between his pig eyes that he lay senseless for
hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; glanced at the broad shoulders and the great knots of
muscle on the man&rsquo;s arms. He was of medium height, but
with a frame of iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, I, too, fled wild and raving from Maganguey
that night, and plunged into the jungle. Months later I
drifted down the river, as far as Mompox. And there one day
I chanced upon old Marcelena, the child&rsquo;s nurse. Like a <i>cayman</i>
I seized her and dragged her into an alley. She confessed
that my wife and girl were living there&ndash;&ndash;the wife had become
housekeeper for a young priest&ndash;&ndash;the girl was in the convent.
<i>Caramba!</i> I hurled the woman to the ground and turned my
back upon the city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s interest in the all too common recital received a
sudden stimulus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter&rsquo;s name, Don Jorge, was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;she would now be, how old, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-two, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair&ndash;&ndash;complexion light, like her mother&rsquo;s. Maria was a
beautiful child&ndash;&ndash;and good as she was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the child&rsquo;s nurse remained with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marcelena? Yes. She was devoted to the little Maria.
The woman was old and ugly&ndash;&ndash;but she loved the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not inquire for them when you were in Mompox
a few months ago?&rdquo; pursued Jos&egrave; eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made slight inquiry through the clerk in the office of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page192' name='book2_page192'></a>192</span>
the Alcalde. I did not intend to&ndash;&ndash;but I could not help it.
<i>Caramba!</i> He made further inquiry, but said only that he
was told they had long since gone down to Cartagena, and
nothing had been heard from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gates of memory&rsquo;s great reservoir opened at the touch
of this man&rsquo;s story, and Jos&egrave; again lived through that moonlit
night in Cartagena, when the little victim of Wenceslas
breathed out her life of sorrow and shame in his arms. He
heard again the sobs of Marcelena and the simple-minded
Catalina. He saw again the figure of the compassionate Christ
in the smoke that drifted past the window. And now the
father of that wronged girl sat before him, wrapped in the
tatters of a shredded happiness! Should he tell him? Should
he say that he had cared for this man&rsquo;s little grandson since
his advent into this sense of existence that mortals call life?
For there could be no doubt now that the little Maria was his
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Jorge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have suffered much. My heart
bleeds for you. And yet&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, there is nothing to do. Were I to find my
family I could only slay them and the priests who came between
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Don Jorge,&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; in horror, &ldquo;you surely meditate
no such vengeance as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man smiled grimly. &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; he returned coldly,
&ldquo;I am Spanish. The blood of the old cavaliers flows in my
veins. I have been betrayed, trapped, fooled, and my honored
name has been foully soiled. What will remove the stain,
think you? Blood&ndash;&ndash;nothing else! <i>Caramba!</i> The priest of
Maganguey who poured the first drop of poison into my wife&rsquo;s
too willing ears&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, I have said enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> You don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, that I drifted down the river, unseen,
to Maganguey one night. I entered that priest&rsquo;s house. He
did not awake the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; exclaimed Jos&egrave;, starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, not God, but Satan! He rules this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank back in his chair. Don Jorge leaned forward and
laid a hand upon his knee. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said evenly, &ldquo;you
are young&ndash;&ndash;how old, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven,&rdquo; murmured Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> A child! <i>Bien</i>, you have much to learn. I
took to you on the boat because I knew you had made a mess
of things, and it was not entirely your fault. I have seen
others like you. You are no more in the Church than I am.
Now why do you stay here? Do I offend in asking?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page193' name='book2_page193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; hesitated. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have&ndash;&ndash;work here, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Don Jorge, &ldquo;a chance to do much for these
poor people&ndash;&ndash;if the odds are not too strong against you. But&ndash;&ndash;are
you working for them alone? Or&ndash;&ndash;does Diego&rsquo;s child
figure in the case? No offense, I assure you&ndash;&ndash;I have reason
to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sought to read his eyes. The man looked squarely
into his own, and the priest found no deception in their black
depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;se&ntilde;or, she cannot be Diego&rsquo;s child&ndash;&ndash;and I&ndash;&ndash;I would
save her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge nodded his head. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to-morrow
I leave for San Lucas. I will return this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the evening meal the <i>guaquero</i> spread his <i>petate</i> upon
the floor and disposed himself for the night. He stubbornly
refused to accept the priest&rsquo;s bed. <i>&ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo;</i> he muttered,
after he had lain quiet for some time, &ldquo;why does not the Church
permit its clergy to marry, like civilized beings! Do you
know, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, I once met a woman in Bogot&aacute; and held
some discussion with her on this topic. She said, as between a
priest who had children, and a married minister, she would
infinitely prefer the priest, because, as she put it, no matter
how dissolute the priest, the sacraments from his hands would
still retain their validity&ndash;&ndash;but never from those of a married
minister! <i>Caramba!</i> what can you do against such bigotry
and awful narrowness, such dense ignorance! Cielo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning, before sunrise, Don Jorge and his
boatmen were on the lake, leaving Jos&egrave; to meditate on the
vivid experiences of the past few days, their strange mental
origin, and the lesson which they brought.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_22' id='CHAPTER_22'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 22</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;you know the question that
we put under the altar of the old church? Well, God
answered it, didn&rsquo;t He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;why, I had forgotten it, child. What was it? You
asked Him to tell us why the people thought they had to die,
did you not? Well&ndash;&ndash;and what was His answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, He told us that they were frightened to death, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, <i>chiquita</i>. Fear killed them&ndash;&ndash;nothing else! They
paid the penalty of death for believing that Feliz Gomez had
slept on a bed where a man had died of the plague. They died
because they&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page194' name='book2_page194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Because they didn&rsquo;t know that God was everywhere, Padre
dear,&rdquo; interrupted Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, <i>chiquita</i>. And that is why all people die. And
yet,&rdquo; he added sadly, &ldquo;how are we going to make them know
that He is everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre dear, by showing them in our talk and our
actions that we know it&ndash;&ndash;by proving it, you know, just as we
prove our problems in algebra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poor Feliz, and Amado, and Guillermo died because
they sinned,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;They broke the first Commandment
by believing that there was another power than God. And
that sin brought its inevitable wage, death. They &lsquo;missed
the mark,&rsquo; and sank into the oblivion of their false beliefs.
God above! that I could keep my own mentality free from
these same carnal beliefs, and so be a true missionary to
suffering humanity! But you, Carmen, you are going to be
such a missionary. And I believe,&rdquo; he muttered through his
set teeth, &ldquo;that I am appointed to shield the girl until God is
ready to send her forth! But what, oh, what will she do when
she meets that world which lies beyond her little Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo had returned to Guamoc&oacute;. &ldquo;The deposit will not
last much longer,&rdquo; he said to Jos&egrave;, shaking his head dubiously.
&ldquo;And then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then we will find another, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied the
priest optimistically.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Ojal&aacute;!&rdquo;</i> exclaimed the old man, starting for the trail.</p>
<p>The day after Don Jorge&rsquo;s departure the Alcalde returned.
He stole shamefacedly through the streets and barricaded himself
in his house. There he gave vent to his monumental
wrath. He cruelly abused his long-suffering spouse, and ended
by striking her across the face. After which he sat down and
laboriously penned a long letter to Padre Diego, in which the
names of Jos&egrave; and Carmen figured plentifully.</p>
<p>For Don Jorge had met the Alcalde in Juncal, and had
roundly jeered him for his cowardly flight. He cited Jos&egrave; and
Rosendo as examples of valor, and pointed out that the Alcalde
greatly resembled a captain who fled at the smell of gunpowder.
Don Mario swelled with indignation and shame. His
spleen worked particularly against Rosendo and the priest.
Come what might, it was time Diego and his superiors in
Cartagena knew what was going on in the parish of Simit&iacute;!</p>
<p>A few days later an unctuous letter came to Jos&egrave; from
Diego, requesting that Carmen be sent to him at once, as he
now desired to place her in a convent and thus supplement the
religious education which he was sure Jos&egrave; had so well begun
in her. The priest had scarcely read the letter when Don Mario
appeared at the parish house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page195' name='book2_page195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Padre</i>,&rdquo; he began smoothly, but without concealing
the malice which lurked beneath his oily words, &ldquo;Padre
Diego sends for the little Carmen, and bids me arrange to have
her conveyed at once to Banco. I think Juan will take her
down, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked him squarely in the eyes. &ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said
in a voice that trembled with agitation, &ldquo;it is not so!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> exclaimed Don Mario, swelling with suppressed
rage. &ldquo;You refuse to give Diego his own child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, but I refuse to give him a child that is not his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> but she is&ndash;&ndash;he has the proofs! And I shall
send her to him this day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde shrilled forth his rage like a ruffled parrot.
Jos&egrave; seized him by the shoulders and, turning him swiftly
about, pushed him out into the road. He then entered the
rear door of Rosendo&rsquo;s house and bade Do&ntilde;a Maria keep the
child close to her.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Fernando Perez appeared at Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
door. He was municipal clerk, secretary, and constable of
Simit&iacute;, all in one. He saluted the priest gravely, and demanded
the body of the child Carmen, to be returned to her proper
father.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; groaned inwardly. What could he do against the established
authority?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Padre</i>,&rdquo; said Fernando, after delivering his message,
&ldquo;the hour is too late to send her down the river to-day. But
deliver her to me, and she shall go down at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; pleaded desperately, &ldquo;Fernando, leave her
here to-night&ndash;&ndash;this is sudden, you must acknowledge&ndash;&ndash;she
must have time to take leave of Do&ntilde;a Maria&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, the Alcalde&rsquo;s order is that she go with me
now. I must obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; felt his control oozing fast. Scarce knowing what he
did, he quickly stepped back through the rear door, and going
to Rosendo&rsquo;s house, seized a large <i>machete</i>, with which he returned
to face the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, Fernando,&rdquo; he cried, holding the weapon menacingly
aloft, &ldquo;if you lay a hand on that girl, I will scatter
your brains through yonder <i>plaza</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo;</i> muttered the constable, falling back. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo;
he hastily added, &ldquo;I will make this report to the Alcalde!&rdquo;
With which he beat an abrupt retreat.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank into a chair. But he hastily arose and went into
Rosendo&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Maria!&rdquo; he cried excitedly, &ldquo;leave
Carmen with me, and do you hurry through the town and see
if Juan is here, and if L&aacute;zaro Ortiz has returned from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page196' name='book2_page196'></a>196</span>
<i>hacienda</i>. Bid them come to me at once, and bring their
<i>machetes</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman set out on her errand. Jos&egrave; seized his <i>machete</i>
firmly in one hand, and with the other drew Carmen to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Padre dear?&rdquo; the child asked, her eyes big with
wonder. &ldquo;Why do you tremble? I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t always
go around thinking that two and two are seven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen, child&ndash;&ndash;you do not understand&ndash;&ndash;you are too
young, and as yet you have had no experience with&ndash;&ndash;with the
world! You must trust me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do <i>not</i> trust you, Padre,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust
anybody who always sees things that are not so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen&ndash;&ndash;you are in danger&ndash;&ndash;and you do not comprehend&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
cried the desperate man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>not</i> in danger&ndash;&ndash;and I <i>do</i> understand&ndash;&ndash;a great deal
better than you do, Padre. Now let me go&ndash;&ndash;you are afraid!
People who are afraid die of the plague!&rdquo; The irony of her
words sank into his soul.</p>
<p>Juan looked in at the door. Jos&egrave; rose hastily. &ldquo;Did you
meet Do&ntilde;a Maria?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; the lad replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is searching for you&ndash;&ndash;have you your <i>machete</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, I have just come back from the island, where
I was cutting wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, then! Remain here with me. I need you&ndash;&ndash;or may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the door and looked eagerly down the street.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed with relief, &ldquo;here come Do&ntilde;a Maria and
L&aacute;zaro! Now, friends,&rdquo; he began, when they were assembled
before him, &ldquo;grave danger threatens&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; It was Do&ntilde;a Maria&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Where is Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned. The child had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&aacute;zaro!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;go at once to the Boque trail! Let
no one pass that way with Carmen, if your life be the penalty!
Juan, hurry to the lake! If either of you see her, call loudly,
and I will come! Do&ntilde;a Maria, start through the town! We
must find her! God above, help us!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The afternoon dragged its interminable length across the
valley. Jos&egrave; wearily entered his house and threw himself
upon a chair. He had not dared call at the Alcalde&rsquo;s house,
for fear he might do that official violence. But he had seen
Fernando in the street, and had avoided him. Then, of a
sudden, a thought came to him from out the darkness. He
sprang to his feet and hurried off toward the shales. There,
beneath the stunted <i>algarroba</i> tree, sat the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; He rushed to her and clasped her in his arms.
&ldquo;Why did you do this&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page197' name='book2_page197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she replied, when she could get her breath, &ldquo;I had
to come out here and try to know for you the things you
ought to know for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing; but, holding her hand tightly, he led her
back to the house.</p>
<p>That evening Jos&egrave; sent for Don Mario, the constable, and
Juan and L&aacute;zaro. Assembling them before him in his living
room, he talked with them long and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Compadres</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this week we have passed through a
sad experience, and the dark angel has robbed us of three of
our beloved friends. Is it your wish that death again visit us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another in wonder. The Alcalde
scowled darkly at the priest beneath his heavy brows. Jos&egrave;
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, it is planned to seize the little Carmen by force, and
send her down the river to Padre Diego&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Dios y diablo!&rdquo;</i> Juan had sprung to his feet. &ldquo;Who says
that, Padre?&rdquo; he demanded savagely. The Alcalde shrank back
in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm, Juan!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; replied. &ldquo;Padre Diego sends for her
by letter&ndash;&ndash;is it not so, Don Mario?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter grunted. Juan wheeled about and stared menacingly
at the bulky official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, friends,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; pursued, &ldquo;it has not been shown that
Carmen belongs to Diego&ndash;&ndash;in fact, all things point to the conclusion
that she is not his child. My wish is to be just to all
concerned. But shall we let the child go to him, knowing what
manner of man he is, until it is proven beyond all doubt that he
is her father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> No!&rdquo; exclaimed Juan and L&aacute;zaro in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am of the opinion that the majority of our citizens
would support us in the contention. What think you, friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man in Simit&iacute;, Padre,&rdquo; replied L&aacute;zaro earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, turning to the Alcalde, &ldquo;until it is
established that Diego has a parent&rsquo;s claim to the girl, Juan
and L&aacute;zaro and I will protect her with our lives. Is it not so,
<i>amigos</i>?&rdquo; addressing the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> Let me see a hand laid upon her!&rdquo; cried Juan
rising.</p>
<p>L&aacute;zaro spoke more deliberately. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I owe
you much. I know you to be q good man&ndash;&ndash;not like Padre
Diego. I know not what claim he may have on the girl, but
this I say: I will follow and support you until it is shown me
that you are in the wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went over and clasped his hand. Then, to the town
officials:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page198' name='book2_page198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, amigos</i>, we will let the matter rest thus, shall we
not? We now understand one another. If harm comes to the
child, the death angel will again stalk through this town,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he looked hard at Don Mario, whilst that official visibly
shrank in size&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;a sharp watch will be
kept over the child. We will submit to proofs&ndash;&ndash;but to nothing
less. And violence will bring bloodshed and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; cried Don Mario, at last finding his voice.
&ldquo;If Diego has the Bishop back of him, he will force us to
deliver the girl&ndash;&ndash;or the Bishop will have the government soldiers
sent here! I can ask for them&ndash;&ndash;and if necessary I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; paled slightly. He knew the Alcalde spoke truth. Don
Mario, seeing that his words had taken effect, quickly followed
up the advantage. &ldquo;Now you, Juan and L&aacute;zaro, do you think
the little whelp worth that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when Juan leaped
across the floor and fell upon him. Jos&egrave; seized the lad and,
with Fernando&rsquo;s help, tore him loose. L&aacute;zaro held his <i>machete</i>
aloft, ready to strike. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s voice rang out sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, men! Stop! Go you to your homes now! Juan,
do you stay here with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad faced the Alcalde and shook his fist. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he
sputtered, &ldquo;send for the soldiers, fat dog that you are! But
when I see them crossing the lake, I will come first to your
house and cut open that big belly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest him, Fernando!&rdquo; shrilled the Alcalde, shaking with
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will cut off the hand that is laid on Juan!&rdquo; cried L&aacute;zaro,
advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men! Men! Don Mario and Fernando, go now! Enough
of this! And for God&rsquo;s sake think twice before you make any
further move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario and his constable departed in sullen silence.
Jos&egrave; let L&aacute;zaro out through the rear door, while he bade Juan
pass the night in the parish house. A consultation was held
with Do&ntilde;a Maria, and it was arranged that Carmen should
sleep in the room with Jos&egrave;, with Juan lying before the door,
until Rosendo should return from the mountains. Then Jos&egrave;
sat down and wrote to the Bishop.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>No reply came from Cartagena until Rosendo returned at
the end of the month. Meanwhile, Jos&egrave; had never for a moment
permitted Carmen to leave his side. The child chafed under
the limitation; but Jos&egrave; and Do&ntilde;a Maria were firm. Juan
lived with the priest; and L&aacute;zaro lurked about the parish house
like a shadow. The Alcalde and his constable remained discreetly
aloof.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page199' name='book2_page199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>But with Rosendo&rsquo;s return came letters from both Wenceslas
and Diego. The latter had laid aside his unction, and
now made a curt and peremptory demand upon Jos&egrave; for the
child. The letter from Wenceslas was noncommittal, stating
only that he was quite uninformed of Diego&rsquo;s claim, but that an
investigation should be made. Jos&egrave; wondered if he had blundered
in laying the case before him.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> ejaculated Rosendo, when he heard Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s story.
&ldquo;It is as I feared! And now the Bishop has the matter in hand!
<i>Caramba!</i> We shall lose her yet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the deposit is played out. There
is no more gold there. And, now that we shall have none to
send to the Bishop each month, Carmen&rsquo;s fate is settled&ndash;&ndash;unless
we go away. And where shall we go? We could not get
out of the country.&rdquo; He hung his head and sat in gloomy dejection.</p>
<p>For more than a year Rosendo had panned the isolated
alluvial deposit, and on his regular monthly returns to Simit&iacute;
he and the priest had sent from thirty to ninety <i>pesos</i> gold to
Wenceslas. To this Jos&egrave; sometimes added small amounts collected
from the people of Simit&iacute;, which they had gratuitously
given him for Masses and for the support of the parish. Wenceslas,
knowing the feeble strength of the parish, was surprised,
but discreet; and though he continually urged Jos&egrave; to
greater efforts, and held out the allurements of &ldquo;indulgences
and special dispensations,&rdquo; he made no inquiries regarding
the source of the monthly contributions.</p>
<p>For many days following, Rosendo and the priest went about
as in a thick, black cloud. &ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; at length,
&ldquo;go back to the mountains and search again. God was with
us before. Have we any reason to doubt Him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave Carmen here, exposed to the danger that always
hangs over her? <i>Caramba</i>, no! I would not go back now even
if the deposit were not worked out! No!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; knew it would
be futile to urge him.</p>
<p>Carmen came to the priest that same day. &ldquo;Padre, I heard
you and padre Rosendo talking this morning. Have you no
money, no gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, child&ndash;&ndash;there seems to be a need just at present,&rdquo; he
replied lightly. &ldquo;But we might&ndash;&ndash;well, we might send another
of your questions to God. What say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she cried delightedly, turning at once and hurrying
away for pencil and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she panted, seating herself at the table. &ldquo;Let us
see; we want Him to give us <i>pesos</i>, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;many&ndash;&ndash;a large sum. Make it big,&rdquo; he said facetiously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page200' name='book2_page200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Padre dear,&rdquo; she replied seriously, &ldquo;we
can&rsquo;t ask for too much&ndash;&ndash;for we already have everything,
haven&rsquo;t we? After all, we can only ask to see what we really
already have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; Padre dear,&rdquo; she pleaded, looking up appealingly
at him staring silently at her. Oh, if she could only impart
to him even a little of her abundant faith! She had
enough, and to spare!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is,&rdquo; she said, holding out the paper.</p>
<p>He took it and read&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Dear, dear God: Padre Jos&egrave; needs
<i>pesos</i>&ndash;&ndash;lots of them. What shall he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;shall we put it under the altar
of the old church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled; but immediately assumed an expression of great
seriousness. &ldquo;Why not in the church here, the one we are
using? The other is so far away?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;And it is
getting dark now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;no, we will go where we went before,&rdquo; she concluded
firmly.</p>
<p>Again he yielded. Taking matches and a piece of candle,
he set off with the girl in a circuitous route for the hill, which
they gained unobserved. Within the musty old church he
struck a light, and they climbed over the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and to the rear
of the crumbling altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she cried joyously. &ldquo;Here is my other question that
He answered! Doesn&rsquo;t He answer them quick though! Why,
it took only a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew the old paper from beneath the adobe brick. Then
she hesitated. &ldquo;Let us put this question in a new place,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Look, up there, where the bricks have fallen out,&rdquo;
pointing to the part of the altar that had crumbled away.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; rose obediently to execute the commission. His thought
was far off, even in Cartagena, where sat the powers that must
be held quiet if his cherished plans were not to fail. He reached
out and grasped one of the projecting bricks to steady himself.
As he did so, the brick, which was loose, gave way with him,
and he fell, almost across Carmen, followed by a shower of
rubbish, as another portion of the old altar fell out.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> he ejaculated, picking himself up. &ldquo;What good
luck that the candle was not extinguished! And now, se&ntilde;orita,
are you willing that we should bury this important question
here on the floor; or must I again try to put it in the altar
itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there,&rdquo; insisted the child, laughing and still pointing
above.</p>
<p>He rose and looked about, searching for a convenient place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page201' name='book2_page201'></a>201</span>
to deposit the paper. Then something attracted his attention,
something buried in the altar, but now exposed by the falling
out of the fresh portion. It was metal, and it glittered in the
feeble candle light. He reached in and hastily scraped away
more of the hard mud. Then, trembling with suppressed excitement,
he pulled out another brick. Clearly, it was a box
that had been buried in there&ndash;&ndash;who knows when? He gave the
candle to Carmen and bade her stand up close. Then with both
hands he carefully removed the adjacent bricks until the entire
box was in view.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> he muttered. &ldquo;What do you suppose this is?
A box&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl in delight. &ldquo;A box to put our
question in, Padre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely the answer itself, child!&rdquo; muttered the excited
priest, straining and tugging away at it. &ldquo;Carmen! Stand
aside!&rdquo; he suddenly commanded. &ldquo;Now&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He gave a final
pull. A crash of falling bricks followed; the candle was extinguished;
and both he and the child were precipitated to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; called the priest, choking with dust, &ldquo;are you
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre dear,&rdquo; came the laughing answer through the
darkness. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m pretty full of dust. And the candle is
buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; groped about for the box. It lay near, a small, wooden
coffer, bound about with two narrow bands of steel. He dragged
it out and bore it down the aisle to the door, followed by Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed eagerly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dusted it off and examined it carefully in the fast fading
light. It was some twelve inches square by three deep, well
made of mahogany, and secured by a small, iron padlock. On
the top there was a crest of arms and the letters, &ldquo;I de R,&rdquo;
burned into the wood.</p>
<p>Night had closed in, and the priest and girl made their
way hurriedly back home by way of the lake, to avoid being
seen. Under his cassock Jos&egrave; carried the box, so heavy that
it chafed the skin from his hip as they stumbled along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen, say nothing&ndash;&ndash;but tell your padre Rosendo to
come to me at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the doors secured, and Carmen and Do&ntilde;a Maria standing
guard outside to apprise them of danger, Jos&egrave; and Rosendo
covertly examined the discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I de R!&rdquo; pondered Rosendo, studying the box. Then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>
Padre&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba!</i> It is <i>Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n!</i> <i>Hombre!</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page202' name='book2_page202'></a>202</span>
And the crest&ndash;&ndash;it is his! I have seen it before&ndash;&ndash;years and
years ago! <i>Caramba!</i> <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; The old man danced about
like a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n! Your grandfather!&rdquo; he kept exclaiming,
his eyes big as saucers. Then, hastening out to get his iron bar,
he returned and with a blow broke the rusty padlock. Tearing
open the hinged cover, he fell back with a loud cry.</p>
<p>Before their strained gaze, packed carefully in sawdust, lay
several bars of yellow metal. Rosendo took them out with
trembling hands and laid them upon the floor. &ldquo;Gold, Padre,
gold!&rdquo; he muttered hoarsely. &ldquo;Gold, buried by your grandfather!
<i>Caramba!&ndash;&ndash;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold these, Padre!&rdquo; hurrying out and returning with a
pair of homemade wooden balances. Again and again he carefully
weighed the bars. Then he began to calculate. It seemed
to Jos&egrave; that the old man wasted hours arriving at a satisfactory
result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he finally announced in tones which he strove
vainly to control, &ldquo;there cannot be less than six thousand
<i>pesos oro</i> here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; drew a long breath. &ldquo;Six thousand <i>pesos</i>&ndash;&ndash;twenty-four
thousand francs! It is a fortune! Rosendo, we are rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trembling old man replaced the bars and carried them
to Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s bed. The priest opened the door and called to Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was in the old box, Padre?&rdquo; she asked happily,
bounding into the room.</p>
<p>He stooped and picked her up, almost crushing her in his
arms. &ldquo;The answer to your question, <i>chiquita</i>. &lsquo;Before they
call I will answer: and while they are yet speaking, I will
hear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 23</h2>
</div>
<p>When Jos&egrave; awoke the next morning he quickly put his
hand under his pillow. Yes, the little coffer was there!
It had not been a dream. He drew it forth and raised
the cover. The yellow bars glittered in the morning rays sifting
through the overhanging thatch at the window. He passed his
hand gently across them. What a fortunate discovery! And
how strangely brought about. They were rich! Now he could
take Carmen and flee! His heart leaped within him as he
hastily threw on his scant attire and went out into the balsamic
air of the tropical morning. Rosendo had gone to the
village of Boque, starting before sun-up, so Do&ntilde;a Maria announced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page203' name='book2_page203'></a>203</span>
Some sudden impulse had seized him, and he had
set out forthwith, not stopping to discuss the motive with his
faithful consort. Jos&egrave; concluded his <i>desayuno</i>, and then summoned
Carmen to the parish house for the day&rsquo;s lessons. She
came with a song on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop, <i>chiquita</i>! Sing it again&ndash;&ndash;it is beautiful; and
my soul drinks it in like heavenly dew!&rdquo; he cried, as the
child danced up to him and threw her plump arms about his
neck.</p>
<p>She turned about and sat down on the dusty threshold and
repeated the little song. The glittering sunlight streamed
through her rich curls like stringers of wire gold. Cucumbra
came fawning to her and nestled at her little bare feet, caressing
them at frequent intervals with his rough tongue. Cantar-las-horas
approached with dignified tread, and, stopping before
his adored little mistress, cocked his head to one side and
listened attentively, his beady eyes blinking in the dazzling
light.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; marveled anew as he listened. Where had that voice
come from? Had either of her parents been so gifted? he
wondered. And yet, it was only the voicing of a soul of stainless
purity&ndash;&ndash;a conscience clear as the light that gilded her curls&ndash;&ndash;a
trust, a faith, a knowledge of immanent good, that manifested
daily, hourly, in a tide of happiness whose far verge
melted into the shore of eternity. As he sat with closed eyes
the adobe hut, with its dirt floor and shabby furnishings, expanded
into a castle, hung with richest tapestries, rarest pictures,
and glittering with plate of gold. The familiar odors of
garlic and saffron, which penetrated from the primitive kitchen
of Do&ntilde;a Maria, were transmuted into delicate perfumes. The
sun drew nearer, and suffused him with its glittering flood.
The girl became a white-robed vision, and her song a benediction,
voicing &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace
among men of good will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song ended, and left the thought with him: &ldquo;To men
of good will?&rdquo; Yes, to men of God&rsquo;s will&ndash;&ndash;the will that is good&ndash;&ndash;to
men of sound mind&ndash;&ndash;that mind which was in Christ Jesus&ndash;&ndash;the
mind that knows no evil! To such is eternal peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; the priest said gently, when the girl returned to
him. &ldquo;Your question was quickly answered yesterday, was it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed up into his face. &ldquo;It was answered, Padre, before
we asked it. God has the answers to all questions that
could ever be asked. We would always know the answers if
we thought the way He does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;tell me, <i>chiquita</i>, do you think He put that little box
up there in the altar purposely for us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page204' name='book2_page204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre&ndash;&ndash;I guess it was hidden there by some man, long
ago, who was afraid he would lose it. And since he was afraid
he would lose it, why&ndash;&ndash;he did, for now we have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the thing that he greatly feared came upon him. But
what is your idea regarding the way we happened to find it?
Did God lead us to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God leads to everything good, Padre dear,&rdquo; was the simple
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But, in this particular case&ndash;&ndash;would we have
been led to the little box if you had not asked your question of
God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Padre? People are always led right when they
think right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so thinking right was the cause of this discovery,
was it?&rdquo; he pursued, relentlessly probing her thought to its
depths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;yes, Padre&ndash;&ndash;of course. We had to have money&ndash;&ndash;you
said so, you know. And you told me to ask for lots of
<i>pesos</i>. Well, we both knew that God had already given us
more <i>pesos</i> than we could ever know what to do with&ndash;&ndash;He
always does. He just can&rsquo;t help giving Himself to everybody.
And He gave Himself to us&ndash;&ndash;why, we have always had Him!
We are <i>in</i> Him, you know. And when anybody just knows
that&ndash;&ndash;why, he sees nothing but good everywhere, and he always
has all that he needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that he wants, you mean, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre, not all that he wants. Just all that he needs.
You might want all the gold in the world&ndash;&ndash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that would be only a selfish, human want. It would
be covetousness. But&ndash;&ndash;you still think we were led right to the
little box, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Padre dear,&rdquo; she replied emphatically. &ldquo;When
we think good, we see good. It always comes out that way.
It is just as sure as getting the right answers to my problems in
algebra when I think right about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thinking right about them means using the right rule,
does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;of course. If I didn&rsquo;t use the right rule&ndash;&ndash;why, what
sort of answers would I get? All jumbled up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely&ndash;&ndash;perfect chaos. But still,&rdquo; vigorously pursuing the
subject, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think we happened upon the little box just
by good luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she shook her curls insistently, &ldquo;things never happen,
<i>never</i>! We see only what we think&ndash;&ndash;always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there surely does seem to be a definite law of cause
and effect. But you did not think gold yesterday, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page205' name='book2_page205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre dear, what a bother you are! No, I didn&rsquo;t think
gold yesterday. I never think gold. But I always think <i>good</i>.
And that is gold and everything else that we need. Can&rsquo;t you
see? And it wasn&rsquo;t just because I thought good yesterday, but
because I think good every day, that I saw the gold. It was
because we needed it, and God had already given us all that we
needed. And I knew that it just <i>had</i> to come. And so did you.
Then, because we really needed it, and knew that it was right
and that it must come&ndash;&ndash;well, it did. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Her
little face was very serious as she looked up appealingly into
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, yes, I see. I just wanted to know how you
would explain it. It becomes clearer to me every day that there
are no such things as miracles&ndash;&ndash;never were! Christ Jesus
<i>never</i> performed miracles, if by that we mean that he set aside
God&rsquo;s laws for the benefit of mankind. But he acted in perfect
accord with those laws&ndash;&ndash;and no wonder the results seemed
miraculous to dull-witted human minds, who had always seen
only their coarse, material thought externalized in material
laws and objects, in chance, mixed good and evil, and a God of
human characteristics!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;guess so, Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;only, I don&rsquo;t understand
your big words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>chiquita</i>, you understand far, far better than I do!
Why, I am learning it all from you! But come, now for the
lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jos&egrave; had learned by this time, too, that between merely
recognizing righteousness as right-thinking, and actually practicing
it&ndash;&ndash;putting it to the test so as to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; God&ndash;&ndash;there is
a vast difference. Things cannot be &ldquo;thought&rdquo; into existence,
nor evils &ldquo;thought&rdquo; away&ndash;&ndash;the stumbling block of the mere tyro
in the study of mental cause and effect. A vast development in
spirituality must precede those &ldquo;signs following&rdquo; before mankind
shall again do the works of the Master. Jos&egrave; knew this;
and he bowed in humble submission, praying for daily light.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At dusk Rosendo returned. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, I have it now, I
think!&rdquo; he cried excitedly, pacing back and forth in the little
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Rosendo?&rdquo; asked the wondering priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret of the little box! Come, while we eat I will tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little group gathered about the table, while Rosendo
unfolded his theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Boque this morning to talk with Do&ntilde;a Lucia.
She is very aged, the oldest inhabitant in these parts. <i>Bien</i>, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page206' name='book2_page206'></a>206</span>
knew that she had known Don Ignacio, although she was not
his slave. Her story brought back to me also the things my
father had often told me about Don Ignacio&rsquo;s last trip to Simit&iacute;.
Putting all these things together, I think I now know how
the little box came to be hidden in the altar of the old church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with happiness, while his auditors
drew closer about him to drink in his dramatic recital.
For Rosendo, like a true Latin, reveled in a wonder-tale. And
his recitals were always accompanied by profuse gesticulation
and wonderful facial expressions and much rolling of the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;it was this way. Don Ignacio&rsquo;s possessions
in Guamoc&oacute; were enormous, and in the then prosperous
city of Simit&iacute; he had stores and warehouses and much property.
When the War of Independence neared its end, and he saw
that the Royalist cause was lost, he made a last and flying trip
to Simit&iacute;, going up the Magdalena river from Cartagena in his
own <i>champ&aacute;n</i>, propelled by some of his still faithful slaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, he found that one of his foremen had just returned
from the mountains with the final clean-up from La Libertad
<i>arrastras</i>. These had been abandoned, for most of the slaves
had deserted, or gone to fight the Spaniards. But the foreman,
who was not a slave, but a faithful employe, had cleaned up
the <i>arrastras</i> and hidden the amalgam until he could find a
favorable opportunity to come down to Simit&iacute; with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when Don Ignacio arrived here, he found the town
practically deserted. So he and the foreman retorted the
amalgam and melted the gold into bars. But, just as they had
completed their task, a messenger came flying to town and
reported that a body of Royalist soldiers were at Badillo, and
that they had learned that Simit&iacute; was the <i>bodega</i> of the rich
Guamoc&oacute; district, and were preparing to come over and sack
the town. They were fleeing down the river to the coast, to
get away to Spain as soon as possible, but had put off at Badillo
to come over here. Fortunately, they had become very intoxicated,
and their expedition was for that reason delayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, at the news the foreman dropped everything and
fled for his life. A few people gathered with the priest in the
Rinc&oacute;n church, the one you are using now, Padre. The priest
of the other old church on the hill fled. <i>Caramba</i>, but he was
a coward&ndash;&ndash;and he got well paid for it, too! But of that later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ignacio&rsquo;s <i>champ&aacute;n</i> was at Badillo, and he had come
across to Simit&iacute; by canoe. <i>Bien</i>, he dared not take this gold
back with him; and so he thought of hiding it in one of the
churches, for that is always a sacred place. There were people
in his own church, and so he hurried to the one on the hill.
Evidently, as he looked about in the deserted building for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page207' name='book2_page207'></a>207</span>
place to hide the bars, he saw that some of the bricks could
easily be removed from the rear of the altar. A couple of
hours sufficed to do the work of secreting the box. Then he
fled across the shales to the town of Boque, where he got a
canoe to take him down to the Magdalena; and there he waited
until he saw the soldiers come across and enter the <i>ca&ntilde;o</i>. Then
he fled to Badillo. Don Nicol&aacute;s, son of Do&ntilde;a Lucia, was his
boatman, and he says that he remained with your grandfather
at that place over night, and that there they received the report
that the Royalists had been terribly whipped in the battle&ndash;&ndash;the
battle of&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! I forget&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Ayacucho,&rdquo; suggested Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; resumed Rosendo. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, there was nothing for
the poor man to do but hasten down the river to Cartagena as
fast as possible, for he knew not what might have befallen his
family. He did not dare go back to Simit&iacute; then for the box.
And so the gold was left in the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> exclaimed Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Now I understand what he
meant by that note in his old diary, which we had in my
father&rsquo;s house, in Spain! Of course! Arriving in Cartagena
he went at once to the Department of Mines and tore out all
the pages of the register that contained descriptions of his
mineral properties. He intended some day to return to Guamoc&oacute;
and again locate them. And meantime, he protected himself
by destroying all the registered locations. It was easy for
him to do this, influential as he was in Cartagena. And doubtless
at that stormy time the office of the Department of Mines
was deserted. This note, Rosendo, I have read in his old diary,
many times, but never knew to what it referred.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Hombre!&rdquo;</i> ejaculated Rosendo. &ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, the soldiers sacked
Simit&iacute; and slaughtered all the people they could find. Then
they set fire to the town, and left. My parents had fled to
Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now for the old church and the picture of the Virgin
that was lost during the terrible storm when the priest fell
dead. We will have to guess that later, when peace had been
restored, the priest of the old church in prying around the altar
discovered the loose bricks and the box behind them. <i>Bueno</i>,
the night of the awful storm he had gone secretly to the church
to remove the box. I remember that my father said the priest
had arranged for my father to take him down to Bodega Central
the very next day. You see, he was going to flee with the
gold, the rogue! <i>Bien</i>, while he was in the church taking out
the loose bricks, that storm broke&ndash;&ndash;and, from what I remember,
it was terrible! The heavens were ablaze with lightning; the
thunder roared like cannon; and the lake rose right out of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page208' name='book2_page208'></a>208</span>
bed! <i>Caramba!</i> The door of the church crashed open, and
the wind whistled in and blew out the candles on the altar.
The wind also tore loose a beautiful picture of the Virgin that
was hanging near the altar. The picture was blown out of its
frame and swept off to the hills, or into the lake. It was never
seen again, although the frame was found just outside the door.
Perhaps it was the extinguishing of the candles and the falling
of the picture that frightened the old priest so terribly. At
any rate he ran from the church to his house, and when he
reached his door he fell dead of apoplexy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, after that you could never get any of the Simit&iacute;
people to enter the church again. They closed the doors and
left it, just as it was, for they thought the curse of God had
fallen upon it because it had been erected by the enemies of
the Rinc&oacute;n family, whose patron saint was the blessed Virgin
herself. Well, the old altar began to crumble, and parts of it
fell away from time to time. And when the people heard the
bricks falling they said it was the bad angel that the Virgin had
locked in there&ndash;&ndash;the angel of Satan that had extinguished the
candles on the altar that night of the storm. <i>Caramba!</i> And
I believed it, too! I am a fool, Padre, a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all fools, Rosendo, when we yield ourselves to
superstition and false belief,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; solemnly. &ldquo;But you
have worked out a very ingenious story, and I doubt not you
have come very near to accounting in the right way for the
presence of the little box in the altar. But now, <i>amigo</i>, come
with me to my house. I would discuss a plan with you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this, Rosendo,&rdquo; he said, when they were alone. &ldquo;We
now have gold, and the way has been providentially opened.
Carmen is in great danger here. What say you, shall we take
her and leave Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s face became grave. He did not reply for some
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;you are right. It would be
best for her if we could get her away. But&ndash;&ndash;you would have
to leave the country. I see now that neither she nor you would
be safe anywhere in Colombia if you left Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;And I am sure that no
country offers the asylum that America does&ndash;&ndash;the America of
the north. I have never been there, <i>amigo</i>; but of all countries
I learn that it is the most tolerant in matters religious. And
it offers the greatest opportunities to one, like Carmen, just
entering upon life. We will go there. And, Rosendo, prepare
yourself and Do&ntilde;a Maria at once, for we had best start without
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rosendo shook his head. &ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; he said slowly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page209' name='book2_page209'></a>209</span>
&ldquo;No. I could not go to the North with you; nor could Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest impatiently, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, we are old. And we know not the language of
those up there. Nor the customs. We could not adapt ourselves
to their ways of life&ndash;&ndash;no, not at our age. Nor could we
endure the change of climate. You tell me they have cold, ice,
snow, up there. What could we do? We would die. No, we
must remain here. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; his voice choked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, do you go, and take the girl. Bring her up
to be a power for good in that great land. We&ndash;&ndash;Maria and I&ndash;&ndash;will
remain in Simit&iacute;. It is not permitted that we should ever
leave. This has always been our home, and here we will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; exclaimed again in impatience. But the old man was
immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre, we could not make so great a change. Anywhere
in Colombia would be but little different from Simit&iacute;.
But up north&ndash;&ndash;in that great country where they do those wonderful
things you have told me about&ndash;&ndash;no, Padre, Maria and I
could not make so great a change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what will you do&ndash;&ndash;leave the
Church? Or will you still be a priest up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question startled Jos&egrave; rudely. In the great joy which
the discovery of the gold had stimulated, and in the thought of
the possibilities opened by it, he had given no heed to his
status respecting the Church. Yet, if he remained in the Church,
he could not make this transfer without the approval of the
Vatican. And that, he well knew, could not be obtained. No,
if he went, he must leave behind all ecclesiastical ties. And
with them, doubtless, the ties which still bound him to his
distant mother and the family whose honored name he bore.
It was not so easy a matter to take the girl and leave Simit&iacute;, now
that he gave the project further consideration.</p>
<p>And yet he could not abandon the idea, however great his
present sense of disappointment. He would cling to it as an
ideal, some day to be realized, and to be worked up to as rapidly
as might be, without exciting suspicion, and without abruptly
severing the ties which, on serious reflection, he found he was
not morally strong enough as yet to break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Rosendo,&rdquo; he concluded in chastened tones. &ldquo;We
will think it over, and try to devise ways to accomplish the
greatest good for the child. I shall remain here for the
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s face beamed with joy. &ldquo;The way will be shown
us some time, Padre!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And while we wait, we
will keep our eyes open, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Jos&egrave; would keep his eyes open and his heart receptive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page210' name='book2_page210'></a>210</span>
After all, as he meditated the situation in the quiet of his little
cottage that evening, he was not sorry that circumstances kept
him longer in Simit&iacute;. For he had long been meditating a plan,
and the distraction incident upon a complete change of environment
certainly would delay, if not entirely defeat, its
consummation. He had planned to translate his Testament
anew, in the light of various works on Bible criticism which
the explorer had mentioned, and which the possession of the
newly discovered gold now made attainable. He had with him
his Greek lexicon. He would now, in the freedom from interruption
which Simit&iacute; could and probably would afford for the
ensuing few months, give himself up to his consecrated desire
to extract from the sacred writings the spiritual meaning
crystallized within them. The vivid experiences which had
fallen to him in Simit&iacute; had resulted in the evolution of ideas&ndash;&ndash;radically
at variance with the world&rsquo;s materialistic thought, it
is true&ndash;&ndash;which he was learning to look upon as demonstrable
truths. The Bible had slowly taken on a new meaning to him,
a meaning far different from that set forth in the clumsy, awkward
phrases and expressions into which the translators so
frequently poured the wine of the spirit, and which, literally
interpreted, have resulted in such violent controversies, such
puerile ideas of God and His thought toward man, and such
religious hatred and bigotry, bloodshed, suffering, and material
stagnation throughout the so-called Christian era. He
would approach the Gospels, not as books of almost undecipherable
mystery, not as the biography of the blessed Virgin,
but as containing the highest human interpretation of truth and
its relation to mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek knowledge,&rdquo; he repeated aloud, as he paced back
and forth through his little living room at night; &ldquo;but it is not
a knowledge of Goethe, of Kant, or Shakespeare; it is not a
knowledge of the poets, the scientists, the philosophers, all
whom the world holds greatest in the realm of thought; it is a
knowledge of Thee, my God, to know whom is life eternal! Men
think they can know Homer, Plato, Confucius&ndash;&ndash;and so they
can. But they think they can <i>not</i> know Thee! And yet Thou
art nearer to us than the air we breathe, for Thou art Life!
What is there out in the world among the multifold interests of
mankind that can equal in importance a demonstrable knowledge
of Thee? Not the unproven theories and opinions, the so-called
&lsquo;authority&rsquo; of the ancient Fathers, good men though they
may have been; not modern pseudo-science, half-truths and
relative facts, saturated with materialism and founded on speculation
and hypothesis; but real knowledge, a knowledge of
Thee that is as demonstrable as the simplest rule in mathematics!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page211' name='book2_page211'></a>211</span>
Alas! that men should be so mesmerized by their own
beliefs as to say Thou canst not be known. Alas! for the burden
which such thinkers as Spencer have laid upon the shoulders
of stumbling mankind. For God <i>can</i> be known, and
proven&ndash;&ndash;else is Jesus responsible for the most cruel lie ever
perpetrated upon the ignorant, suffering world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, putting aside a portion of his gold&ndash;&ndash;his by right of
inheritance as well as discovery&ndash;&ndash;for the future purchase of
such books and aids as he might require, Jos&egrave; set his house
in order and then plunged into such a search of the Scriptures
as rendered him oblivious to all but the immediate interests of
Carmen and her foster-parents. The great world again narrowed
into the rock-bound confines of little Simit&iacute;. Each
rushing morn that shot its fiery glow through the lofty treetops
sank quickly into the hush of noon, while the dust lay thick,
white, and hot on the slumbering streets of the ancient town;
each setting sun burned with dreamy radiance through the
afternoon haze that drew its filmy veil across the seething
valley; each night died into a stillness, lonely and awful. Nature
changed her garb with monotonous regularity; the drowsing
children of this tropic region passed their days in dull torpidity;
Jos&egrave; saw nothing of it all. At times a villager would
bring a tale of grievance to pour into his ears&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a jaguar
had pounced upon his dog on his little <i>finca</i> across the lake, or
a huge snake had lured a suckling pig into its cavernous maw.
At times a credulous woman would stop before his open door
to dilate upon the thick worms that hung upon the leaves of
the <i>algarrobas</i> and dropped their wool-like fibers upon the
natives as they passed below, causing intermittent fevers. Perhaps
an anxious mother would seek him for advice regarding
her little son, who had eaten too much dirt, and was suffering
from the common &ldquo;<i>jipitera</i>,&rdquo; that made his poor little abdomen
protrude so uncomfortably. Again, Rosendo might steal in for
a few moments&rsquo; mysterious, whispered talk about buried treasure,
or the fables of El Dorado and Parim&eacute;. Jos&egrave; had time for
them all, though as he listened his thought hovered ever about
the green verge of Galilee.</p>
<p>By his side worked Carmen, delving assiduously into the
mysteries of mathematics and the modern languages. When
the day&rsquo;s work closed for them both, he often asked her to sing
to him. And then, leaning back with closed eyes, he would
yield himself to the soft dreams which her sweet voice called
up from his soul&rsquo;s unfathomed depths. Often they walked
together by the lake on a clear night; and on these little excursions,
during which they were never beyond Rosendo&rsquo;s
watchful eye, Jos&egrave; reveled in the girl&rsquo;s airy gaiety and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page212' name='book2_page212'></a>212</span>
spontaneous flow of her sparkling thought. He called her his
domestic sunbeam; but in his serious moments&ndash;&ndash;and they
were many&ndash;&ndash;he studied her with a wistful earnestness, while
he sought to imbibe her great trust, her fearlessness, her unswerving
loyalty to the Christ-principle of immanent Good.
He would never permit restraint to be imposed upon her, even
by Rosendo or his good wife. She knew not what it was to be
checked in the freest manifestation of her natural character.
But there was little occasion for restraint, for Carmen dwelt ever
in the consciousness of a spiritual universe, and to it paid
faithful tribute. She saw and knew only from a spiritual basis;
and she reaped the rewards incident thereto. His life and hers
were such as fools might label madness, a colorless, vegetative
existence, devoid of even the elemental things that make mundane
existence worth the while. But the appraisal of fools is
their own folly. Jos&egrave; knew that the torrid days which drew their
monotonous length over the little town were witnessing a development
in both himself and the child that some day would
bear richest fruit. So far from being educated to distrust
spiritual power, as are the children of this world, Carmen was
growing up to know no other. Instead of the preponderance of
her belief and confidence being directed to the material, she
was developing the consciousness that the so-called evidence of
the physical senses is but mortal thought, the suppositional opposite
of the thought of the infinite God who says to mankind:
&ldquo;For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, thoughts of
peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end.&rdquo; Jos&egrave; knew
that his method of education was revolutionary. But he also
knew that it was not wholly his; that the child had really taken
this course herself, as if led thereto by a power beyond them
both.</p>
<p>And so he watched her, and sought to learn from her as
from Christ&rsquo;s own loving and obedient disciple. It was because
of his obedience to God that Jesus was able to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; Him in
the mighty works which we call miracles. He said, &ldquo;If any man
will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be
of God.&rdquo; Plain enough, indeed! And Carmen did do His will;
she kept the very first Commandment; she walked by faith,
and not by the sight of the human senses. She had been called
an &ldquo;<i>hada</i>,&rdquo; a witch, by the dull-witted folk of Simit&iacute;; and some
day it would be told that she had a devil. But the Master had
borne the same ignominy. And so has every pioneer in Truth,
who has dared to lay the axe at the roots of undemonstrable
orthodox belief and entrenched human error.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; often trembled for the child when he thought of the
probable reception that awaited her in the world without, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page213' name='book2_page213'></a>213</span>
case she ever left Simit&iacute;. Would her supreme confidence in
good ever be weakened by an opposite belief in evil? Would
her glorious faith ever be neutralized or counterbalanced by
faith in a power opposed to God? He wondered. And sometimes
in the fits of abstraction resulting from these thoughts,
the girl would steal up to him and softly whisper, &ldquo;Why, Padre,
are you trying to make two and two equal seven?&rdquo; Then he
would laugh with her, and remember how from her algebraic
work she had looked up one day and exclaimed, &ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;why,
all evil can be reduced to a common denominator, too&ndash;&ndash;<i>and it
is zero</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As recreation from the task of retranslating his Greek Testament,
Jos&egrave; often read to Carmen portions from the various
books of the Bible, or told her the old sacred stories that children
so love to hear. But Carmen&rsquo;s incisive thought cut deep
into them, and Jos&egrave; generally found himself hanging upon the
na&iuml;ve interpretations of this young girl. When, after reading
aloud the two opposing accounts of the Creation, as given in the
first and second chapters of Genesis, she asked, &ldquo;But, Padre,
why did God change His mind after He made people and gave
them dominion over everything?&rdquo; Jos&egrave; was obliged to say that
God had not made a mistake, and then gone back afterward to
rectify it; that the account of the Creation, as given in Genesis,
was not His, but was a record of the dawning upon the human
thought of the idea of the spiritual Creation; that the &ldquo;mist&rdquo;
which went up from the earth was suppositional error; and
that the record of the Creation which follows after this was
only the human mind&rsquo;s interpretation of the real, spiritual
Creation, that Creation which is the ever unfolding of infinite
Mind&rsquo;s numberless, perfect ideas. The book of Genesis has
been a fetish to human minds; and not until the limitations imposed
by its literal interpretation were in a measure removed
did the human mentality begin to rise and expand. And when,
reading from Isaiah, the grandest of the ancient prophets, the
ringing words, &ldquo;Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his
nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?&rdquo; the child asked
him if that did not refer to the very kind of people with whom
they had daily intercourse, he had been obliged to say that it
did, and that that sort of man was far, very far, from being the
man of God&rsquo;s own creating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mist, child, which is mentioned in the second chapter
of Genesis, is said to have gone up from the ground. That is,
it went up from matter. And so it is typical of materialism,
from which all evil comes. The material is the direct opposite
of the spiritual. Every bit of evil that men think they
can see, or know, or do, comes as testimony of the five material
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page214' name='book2_page214'></a>214</span>
senses. These might well be called the &lsquo;ground&rsquo; senses. In the
book of Genesis, you will notice that the account of the real
comes first; then follows the account of its opposite, the unreal
man of dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The plus sign is followed
by a minus sign, isn&rsquo;t it? And the man made of dust is the
real man with a minus sign before him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of dust is the human mind&rsquo;s interpretation of the
spiritual man, dear child,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;All human beings
are interpretations by the mortal, or human, mind of infinite
Mind, God, and His spiritual Creation. The interpretation is
made in the human mind, and remains there. The human mind
does not see these interpretations outside of itself&ndash;&ndash;it does not
see real men, and houses, and trees, outside of itself&ndash;&ndash;but it sees
its mental interpretations of God, which it calls men, and
houses, and trees, and so on. These things are what we might
call <i>mental concepts</i>. They are the man and the creation
spoken of in the second chapter of Genesis after the mist went
up from matter, from the ground, from materialism, resulting
in the testimony of the physical senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, they are not real&ndash;&ndash;these mental concepts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They are illusions. They are formed in mentalities
that are themselves wrong interpretations of the infinite Mentality,
called God. They are formed without any rule or principle.
They are made up of false thoughts, false opinions, beliefs
of power opposed to God, beliefs in evil, in sickness, disaster,
loss, and death. They are the results of educated and inherited
and attached beliefs. They are largely made up of fear-beliefs.
The human mentalities see these various beliefs combined
in what it calls men and women, houses, animals, trees,
and so on, all through the material so-called creation. It is this
wrong interpretation that has caused all the suffering and
sorrow in the world. And it is this false stuff that the good
man Jesus finally said he had overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he do it, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By knowing its nothingness, and by knowing the Allness
of his Father, infinite Mind. He called this false stuff a lie
about God. And he overcame that lie by knowing the truth&ndash;&ndash;just
as you overcome the thought that you cannot solve your
algebraic problems by knowing the truth that will and does
solve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, you said once that Jesus was the best man
that ever lived. Was he just a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>. That is, the human minds all about him
saw their mental concepts of him as a man. But he was a
human concept that most clearly represented God&rsquo;s idea of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page215' name='book2_page215'></a>215</span>
Himself. Mortal, human minds are like window-panes, <i>chiquita</i>.
When a window-pane is very dirty, very much covered
with matter, only a little light can get through it. Some
human minds are cleaner, less material, than others, and they
let more light through. Jesus was the cleanest mind that was
ever with us. He kept letting more and more light&ndash;&ndash;Truth&ndash;&ndash;through
himself, until at last all the matter, even the matter
composing the material concept that people called his earthly
body, dissolved in the strong light, and the people saw him no
more. That is called the Ascension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;Padre, don&rsquo;t we have to do that way, too?&rdquo; she asked
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, <i>chiquita</i>. We must, every one of us, do exactly
as Jesus did. We must wash ourselves clean&ndash;&ndash;wash off the
dirty beliefs of power apart from God; we must wash off the
beliefs of evil as a power, created in opposition to Him, or permitted
by Him to exist and to use His children; we must wash
off beliefs of matter as real and created by Him. We must
know that matter and all evil, all that decays and passes away,
all discord and disease, everything that comes as testimony of
the five physical senses, is but a part of the lie about Him, the
stuff that has the minus sign before it, making it less than
nothing. We must know that it is the suppositional opposite
of the real&ndash;&ndash;it is an illusion, seeming to exist, yet evaporating
when we try to define it or put a finger on it, for it has no rule
or principle by which it was created and by which it continues
to exist. Its existence is only in human thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Jos&egrave; assured himself, the Gospels are not &ldquo;loose, exaggerated,
inaccurate, credulous narratives.&rdquo; They are the story
of the clearest transparency to truth that was ever known to
mortals as a human being. They preserve the life-giving words
of him whose mission it was to show mankind the way out of
error by giving them truth. They contain the rule given by the
great Mathematician, who taught mankind how to solve their
life-problems. They tell the world plainly that there seems to
exist a lie about God; that every real idea of the infinite Mind
seems to have its suppositional opposite in a material illusion.
They tell us plainly that resisting these illusions with truth
renders them nugatory. They tell us clearly that the man
Jesus was so filled with truth that he proved the nothingness
of the lie about God by doing those deeds that seemed marvelous
in the eyes of men, and yet which he said we could and
should do ourselves. And we must do them, if we would throw
off the mesmerism of the lie. The human concept of man and
the universe must dissolve in the light of the truth that comes
through us as transparencies. And it were well if we set about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page216' name='book2_page216'></a>216</span>
washing away the dirt of materialism, that the light may shine
through more abundantly.</p>
<p>Jesus did not say that his great deeds were accomplished
contrary to law, but that they fulfilled the law of God. The
law is spiritual, never material. Material law is but human
limitation. Ignorance of spiritual law permits the belief in
its opposite, material law, or laws of matter. False, human
beliefs, opinions, and theories, material speculations and superstitions,
parade before the human mind as laws. Jesus swept
them all aside by knowing that their supposed power lay only
in human acceptance. The human mind is mesmerized by its
own false thought. Even Paul at times felt its mesmerism
and exclaimed: &ldquo;I find then a law, that, when I would do
good, evil is present with me.&rdquo; The very idea of good stirs up
its opposite in the human consciousness. But Paul rose above
it and saw its nothingness. Then he cried: &ldquo;The law of the
Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law
of sin and death.&rdquo; He recognized the spiritual law that Jesus
employed; and with it he overcame the mesmerism of the lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be a Christian, then,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;means not merely
taking the name of Christ, and, while morally opposing sin,
succumbing to every form of mesmerism that the lie about
God exerts. No, it is infinitely more! It means recognizing the
nature of God and His Creation, including Man, to be wholly
spiritual&ndash;&ndash;and the nature of the material creation and mankind
as their opposite, as mental concepts, existing as false interpretations
of the spiritual Universe and Man, and as having their
place only in the false human consciousness, which itself is a
mental activity concerned only with false thought, the suppositional
opposite of God&rsquo;s thought. It means taking this
Truth, this spiritual law, as we would take a mathematical rule
or principle, and with it overcoming sin, sickness, discord of
every name and nature, even to death itself. What, oh, what
have so-called Christians been doing these nearly two thousand
years, that they have not ere this worked out their salvation as
Jesus directed them to do? Alas! they have been mesmerized&ndash;&ndash;simply
mesmerized by the lie. The millennium should have
come long, long ago. It would come to-day if the world would
obey Jesus. But it will not come until it does obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day after day, week after week, month after month, Jos&egrave;
delved and toiled, studied and pondered. The books which he
ordered through the Empresa Alemania, and for which for
some two months he waited in trembling anticipation and fear
lest they be lost in transit, finally arrived. When Juan brought
them up from Bodega Central, Jos&egrave; could have wept for joy.
Except for the very few letters he had received at rare intervals,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page217' name='book2_page217'></a>217</span>
these were the only messages that had penetrated the
isolation of Simit&iacute; from the outside world in the two long years
of his exile. His starving mind ravenously devoured them.
They afforded his first introduction to that fearlessly critical
thought regarding things religious which has swept across the
world like a tidal wave, and washed away so many of the bulwarks
of superstition and ignorance bred of fear of the unknown
and supposedly unknowable.</p>
<p>And yet they were not really his first introduction to that
thought, for, as he pored over these books, his heart expanded
with gratitude to the brusque explorer whom he had met in
Cartagena, that genial, odd medley of blunt honesty, unquibbling
candor, and hatred of dissimulation, whose ridicule of
the religious fetishism of the human mentality tore up the
last root of educated orthodox belief that remained struggling
for life in the altered soil of his mind.</p>
<p>But, though they tore down with ruthless hand, <i>these books
did not reconstruct</i>. Jos&egrave; turned from them with something of
disappointment. He could understand why the trembling heart,
searching wearily for truth, turned always from such as they
with sinking hope. They were violently iconoclastic&ndash;&ndash;they up-rooted&ndash;&ndash;they
overthrew&ndash;&ndash;they swept aside with unsparing hand&ndash;&ndash;but
they robbed the starving mortal of his once cherished
beliefs&ndash;&ndash;they snatched the stale and feebly nourishing bread
from his mouth, and gave nothing in return. They emptied his
heart, and left it starving. What did it boot to tell a man that
the orthodox dream of eternal bliss beyond the gates of death
was but a hoax, if no substitute be offered? Why point out the
fallacies, the puerile conceptions, the worse than childish
thought expressed in the religious creeds of men, if they were
not to be replaced by life-sustaining truth? If the demolition of
cherished beliefs be not followed by reconstruction upon a sure
foundation of demonstrable truth, then is the resulting state of
mind worse than before, for the trusting, though deceived, soul
has no recourse but to fall into the agnosticism of despair, or
the black atheism of positive negation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happily for me,&rdquo; he sighed, as he closed his books at length,
&ldquo;that Carmen entered my empty life in time with the truth that
she hourly demonstrates!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 24</h2>
</div>
<p>Days melted into weeks, and these in turn into months.
Simit&iacute;, drab and shabby, a crumbling and abandoned
relique of ancient Spanish pride and arrogance, drowsed
undisturbed in the ardent embrace of the tropical sun. Don
Jorge returned, unsuccessful, from his long quest in the San
Lucas mountains, and departed again down the Magdalena
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a marvelous country up there,&rdquo; he told Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I do not
wonder that it has given rise to legends. I felt myself in a
land of enchantment while I was roaming those quiet mountains.
When, after days of steady traveling, I would chance
upon a little group of natives hidden away in some dense
thicket, it seemed to me that they must be fairies, not real.
I came upon the old trail, Padre, the <i>Camino Real</i>, now
sunken and overgrown, which the Spaniards used. They
called it the Panam&aacute; trail. It used to lead down to Cartagena.
<i>Hombre</i>! in places it is now twenty feet deep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, gold, Don Jorge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Padre, what quartz veins I saw in that country!
<i>Hombre</i>! Gold will be discovered there without measure some
day! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! This map which Don Carlos gave me is
much in error. I must consult again with him. Then I
shall return to Simit&iacute;.&rdquo; Jos&egrave; regretfully saw him depart, for
he had grown to love this ruggedly honest soul.</p>
<p>Meantime, Don Mario sulked in his house; nor during the
intervening year would he hold anything more than the most
formal intercourse with the priest. Jos&egrave; ignored him as far
as possible. Events move with terrible deliberation in these
tropic lands, and men&rsquo;s minds are heavy and lethargic. Jos&egrave;
assumed that Don Mario had failed in the support upon which
he had counted; or else Diego&rsquo;s interest in Carmen was dormant,
perhaps utterly passed. Each succeeding day of quiet
increased his confidence, while he rounded out month after
month in this sequestered vale on the far confines of civilization,
and the girl attained her twelfth year. Moreover, as he
noted with marveling, often incredulous, mental gaze her
swift, unhindered progress, the rapid unfolding of her rich nature,
and the increasing development of a spirituality which
seemed to raise her daily farther above the plane on which he
dwelt, he began to regard the uninterrupted culmination of his
plans for her as reasonably assured, if not altogether certain.</p>
<p>Juan continued his frequent trips down to Bodega Central
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page219' name='book2_page219'></a>219</span>
as general messenger and transportation agent for his fellow-townsmen,
meanwhile adoring Carmen from a distance of
respectful decorum. Rosendo and L&aacute;zaro, relaxing somewhat
their vigilance over the girl, labored daily on the little <i>hacienda</i>
across the lake. The dull-witted folk, keeping to their dismally
pretentious mud houses during the pulsing heat of day,
and singing their weird, moaning laments in the quiet which
reigned over this maculate hollow at night, followed undeviatingly
the monotonous routine of an existence which had
no other aim than the indulgence of the most primitive material
wants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo would say of them, &ldquo;they are so
easy! They love idleness; they like not labor. They fish, they
play the guitar, they gather fruits. They sing and dance&ndash;&ndash;and
then die. Padre, it is sad, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aye, thought the priest, doubly sad in its mute answer to
the heartlessly selfish query of Cain. No one, not even the
Church, was the keeper of these benighted brothers. He alone
had constituted himself their shepherd. And as they learned
to love him, to confide their simple wants and childish hopes
to him, he came to realize the immense ascendency which the
priests of Colombia possess over the simple understanding of
the people. An ascendency hereditary and dominant, capable
of utmost good, but expressed in the fettering of initiative
and action, in the suppression of ambition, and the quenching
of every impulse toward independence of thought. How he
longed to lift them up from the drag of their mental encompassment!
Yet how helpless he was to afford them the needed
lustration of soul which alone could accomplish it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do little more than try to set them a standard of
thought,&rdquo; he would muse, as he looked out from the altar over
the camellia-like faces of his adult children when he conducted
his simple Sunday services. &ldquo;I can only strive to
point out the better things of this life&ndash;&ndash;to tell them of the
wonders of invention, of art, of civilization&ndash;&ndash;I can only relate
to them tales of romance and achievement, and beautiful
stories&ndash;&ndash;and try to omit in the recital all reference to the evil
methods, aims, and motives which have manifested in those
dark crimes staining the records of history. The world calls
them historical incident and fact. I must call them &lsquo;the mist
that went up from the ground and watered the face of the
earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; had progressed during his years in Simit&iacute;. It had
been hard&ndash;&ndash;only he could know how hard!&ndash;&ndash;to adapt himself
to the narrow environment in which he dwelt. It had been
hard to conform to these odd ways and strange usages. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page220' name='book2_page220'></a>220</span>
he now knew that the people&rsquo;s reserve and shyness at first was
due to their natural suspicion of him. For days, even weeks,
he had known that he was being weighed and watched. And
then love triumphed.</p>
<p>It is true, the dull staring of the natives of this unkempt
town had long continued to throw him into fits of prolonged
nervousness. They had not meant to offend, of course. Their
curiosity was far from malicious. But at hardly any hour of
the day or night could he look up from his work without seeing
dark, inquisitive faces peering in through the latticed
window or the open door at him, watchful of the minutest
detail of his activity. He had now grown used to that. And
he had grown used to their thoughtless intrusion upon him
at any hour. He had learned, too, not to pale with nausea
when, as was their wont of many centuries, the dwellers in
this uncouth town relentlessly pursued their custom of expectorating
upon his floor immediately they entered and stood
before him. He had accustomed himself to the hourly intrusion
of the scavenger pigs and starving dogs in his house.
And he could now endure without aching nerves the awful
singing, the maudlin wails, the thin, piercing, falsetto howls
which rose almost nightly about him in the sacred name of
music. For these were children with whom he dwelt. And
he was trying to show them that they were children of God.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s education was progressing marvelously. Already
Jos&egrave; had been obliged to supplement his oral instruction
with texts purchased for her from abroad. Her grasp of
the English language was his daily wonder. After two years
of study she spoke it readily. She loved it, and insisted that
her conversations with him should be conducted wholly in it.
French and German likewise had been taken up; and her
knowledge of her own Castilian tongue had been enriched by
the few books which he had been able to secure for her from
Spain.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s anomalous position in Simit&iacute; had ceased to cause
him worry. What mattered it, now that he had endeared himself
to its people, and was progressing undisturbed in the training
of Carmen? He performed his religious duties faithfully.
His people wanted them. And he, in turn, knew that upon his
observance of them depended his tenure of the parish.</p>
<p>And he wanted to remain among them, to lead them, if
possible, at least a little way along what he was daily seeing
to be the only path out of the corroding beliefs of the human
mind. He knew that his people&rsquo;s growth would be slow&ndash;&ndash;how
slow might not his own be, too! Who could say how unutterably
slow would be their united march heavenward! And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page221' name='book2_page221'></a>221</span>
yet, the human mind was expanding with wonderful rapidity
in these last days. What acceleration had it not acquired since
that distant era of the Old Stone Man, when through a hundred
thousand years of darkness the only observable progress was a
little greater skill in the shaping of his crude flint weapons!</p>
<p>To Padre Diego&rsquo;s one or two subsequent curt demands that
Carmen be sent to him, Jos&egrave; had given no heed. And perhaps
Diego, absorbed in his political activities as the confidential
agent of Wenceslas, would have been content to let his claim
upon the child lapse, after many months of quiet, had not
Don Jorge inadvertently set the current of the man&rsquo;s thought
again in her direction.</p>
<p>For Don Jorge was making frequent trips along the Magdalena
river. It was essential to his business to visit the various
riverine towns and to mingle freely with all grades of people,
that he might run down rumors or draw from the inhabitants
information which might result in valuable clues anent buried
treasure. Returning one day to Simit&iacute; from such a trip, he
regaled Jos&egrave; with the spirited recital of his experience on a
steamboat which had become stranded on a river bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the old tub at last broke loose.
Then we saw that its engines were out of commission; and so
the captain let her drift down to Banco, where we docked. I
was forced, not altogether against my will, to put up with
Padre Diego. <i>Caramba</i>! The old fox! But I had much
amusement at his expense when I twitted him about his
daughter Carmen, and his silly efforts to get possession of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; shook with indignation. &ldquo;Good heaven, friend!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;why can you not let sleeping dogs alone? Diego is not
the man to be bearded like that! Would that you had kept
away from the subject! And what did you say to him about
the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, man! I only told him how beautiful she was,
and how large for her few years. <i>Bien</i>, I think I said she was
the most beautiful and well-formed girl I had ever seen. But
was there anything wrong in telling the truth, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; bitterly, as he turned away; &ldquo;you meant
no harm. But, knowing the man&rsquo;s brutal nature, and his assumed
claim on the girl, why could you not have foreseen
possible misfortune to her in dwelling thus on her physical
beauty? <i>Hombre</i>, it is too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; said Don Jorge soothingly, &ldquo;nothing can come
of it. Bien, you take things so hard!&rdquo; But when Don Jorge
again set out for the mountains he left the priest&rsquo;s heart filled
with apprehension.</p>
<p>A few weeks later came what Jos&egrave; had been awaiting, another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page222' name='book2_page222'></a>222</span>
demand upon him for the girl. Failure to comply with
it, said Diego&rsquo;s letter, meant the placing of the case in the
hands of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities for action.</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s face grew hard when he read the note. &ldquo;There is
a way, Padre. Let my woman take the girl and go up the
Boque river to Rosa Maria, the clearing of Don Nicol&aacute;s. It is
a wild region, where tapirs and deer roam, and where hardly
a man has set foot for centuries. The people of Boque will
keep our secret, and she can remain hidden there until&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rosendo, that will not do,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;, shaking his
head in perplexity. &ldquo;The girl is developing rapidly, and such
a course would result in a mental check that might spell infinite
harm. She and Do&ntilde;a Maria would die to live by themselves
up there in that lonely region. What about her studies?
And&ndash;&ndash;what would I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you go too, Padre,&rdquo; suggested Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>amigo</i>, for that would cause search to be instituted by
the Bishop, and we certainly would be discovered. But, to take
her and flee the country&ndash;&ndash;and the Church&ndash;&ndash;how can I yet?
No, it is impossible!&rdquo; He shook his head dolefully, while his
thoughts flew back to Seville and the proud mother there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, let us increase our contributions to Don
Wenceslas. Let us send him from now on not less than one
hundred <i>pesos oro</i> each month. Will not that keep him quiet,
no matter what Diego says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; assented Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;At any rate, we will try it.&rdquo;
They still had some three thousand <i>pesos</i> gold left.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, some days later, as they sat together
in the parish house, &ldquo;what do you think Diego wants of the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; hesitated. &ldquo;I think, Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began. But could
even a human mind touch such depths of depravity? And yet&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
think,&rdquo; he continued slowly, &ldquo;that Diego, having seen her,
and now speculating on her future beauty of face and form&ndash;&ndash;I
think he means to place her in a convent, with the view of
holding her as a ready substitute for the woman who now lives
with him&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios</i>! And that is my own daughter!&rdquo; cried Rosendo,
springing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;true, Rosendo. And, if I mistake not, Diego also
would like to repay the score he has against you, for driving
him from Simit&iacute; and holding the threat of death over him these
many years. He can most readily do this by getting Carmen
away from you&ndash;&ndash;as he did the other daughter, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo came and stood before the priest. His face was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page223' name='book2_page223'></a>223</span>
strained with fearful anxiety. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said in a low voice,
&ldquo;I shall end this matter at once. I go to Banco to-morrow to
kill Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall do nothing of the kind!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, seizing his
hand. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo, it would mean your own death, or
lifelong imprisonment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of that, Padre?&rdquo; said the old man with awful
calmness. &ldquo;I have nothing that is not hers, even to my life.
Gladly would I give it for her. Let me die, or spend my remaining
days in the prison, if that will save her. Such a price
for her safety would be low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, Fernando, the town constable, entered.
He saluted the men gravely, and drew from his pocket
a document to which was attached the Alcalde&rsquo;s official seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he said with much dignity, as if the majesty of
his little office weighed upon him, &ldquo;I am commanded by Se&ntilde;or,
the Alcalde, to exercise the authority reposing in him and place
Don Rosendo Ariza under arrest. You will at once accompany
me to the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i>,&rdquo; he added, going up to the astonished Rosendo
and laying a hand upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest! Me! <i>Hombre</i>! what have I done?&rdquo; cried the old
man, stepping back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, <i>amigo</i>, I do not find it my duty to tell you. The
Se&ntilde;or Alcalde hands me the document and commands me to
execute it. As for the cause&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, you must ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, the first to recover from his astonishment,
&ldquo;let us go to him at once.&rdquo; He at any rate had now an opportunity
to confront Don Mario and learn what plans the man had
been devising these many months.</p>
<p>The Alcalde received the men in his little <i>patio</i>, scowling
and menacing. He offered them no greeting when they confronted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave; in a trembling voice, &ldquo;why have
you put this indignity upon our friend, Rosendo? Who orders
his arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask, rather, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; replied the Alcalde, full of
wrath, &ldquo;what alone saves you from the same indignity.
Only that you are a priest, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, <i>nada m&aacute;s</i>! His arrest
is ordered by Padre Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, if I may beg the favor?&rdquo; pursued Jos&egrave;, though
he well knew the sordid motive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? <i>Caramba</i>! Why lay the hands of the law upon
those who deprive a suffering father of his child! <i>Bien</i>,
<i>Fernando</i>,&rdquo; turning to the constable, &ldquo;you have done well.
Take your prisoner to the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Rosendo, drawing back. &ldquo;No, Don Mario, I
will not go to the jail! I will&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page224' name='book2_page224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; shouted the Alcalde, his face purple. &ldquo;I set
your trial for to-morrow, in the early morning. But this
night you will spend in the jail! <i>Hombre!</i> I will see if I am
not Alcalde here! And look you, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, if there is any
disturbance, I will send for the government soldiers! Then
they will take Rosendo to the prison in Cartagena! And that
finishes him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew that, if Diego had the support of the Bishop,
this was no idle threat. Rosendo turned to him in helpless
appeal. &ldquo;What shall I do, Padre?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is best that you go to the jail to-night, Rosendo,&rdquo; said
Jos&egrave; with sinking heart. &ldquo;But, Don Mario,&rdquo; turning menacingly
to the Alcalde, &ldquo;mark you, his trial takes place in the
morning, and he shall be judged, not by you alone, but by his
fellow-townsmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not said so, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; returned Don Mario curtly,
with a note of deep contempt in his voice.</p>
<p>As in most small Spanish towns, the jail was a rude adobe
hut, with no furnishings, save the wooden stocks into which
the feet of the hapless prisoners were secured. Thus confined,
the luckless wight who chanced to feel the law&rsquo;s heavy
hand might sit in a torturing position for days, cruelly tormented
at night by ravenous mosquitoes, and wholly dependent
upon the charity of the townsfolk for his daily rations,
unless he have friends or family to supply his needs. In the
present instance Don Mario took the extra precaution of
setting a guard over his important prisoner.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;, benumbed by the shock and bewildered by the sudden
precipitation of events, accompanied Rosendo to the jail and
mutely watched the procedure as Fernando secured the old
man&rsquo;s bare feet in the rude stocks. And yet, despite the situation,
he could not repress a sense of the ridiculous, as his
thought dwelt momentarily on the little <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i> which
these child-like people were so continually enacting in their
attempts at self-government. But it was a play that at times
approached dangerously near to the tragic. The passions of
this Latin offshoot were strong, if their minds were dull and
lethargic, and when aroused were capable of the most despicable,
as well as the most grandly heroic deeds. And in
the present instance, when the fleeting sense of the absurd
passed, Jos&egrave; knew that he was facing a crisis. Something
told him that resistance now would be useless. True, Rosendo
might have opposed arrest with violence, and perhaps
have escaped. But that would have accomplished nothing for
Carmen, the pivot upon which events were turning. Jos&egrave; had
reasoned that it were better to let the Alcalde play his hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page225' name='book2_page225'></a>225</span>
first, in the small hope that as the cards fell he might more
than match his opponent&rsquo;s strength with his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, do not worry,&rdquo; said Rosendo reassuringly. &ldquo;It
is for her sake; and we shall have to know, as she does, that
everything will come out right. My friends will set me free
to-morrow, when the trial takes place. And then&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he drew
the priest down to him and whispered low&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we will leave
Simit&iacute; and take to the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; bent his heavy steps homeward. Arriving at Rosendo&rsquo;s
house, he saw the little living room crowded with
sympathetic friends who had come to condole with Do&ntilde;a
Maria. That placid woman, however, had not lost in any degree
her wonted calm, even though her companions held forth
with much impassioned declamation against the indignity
which had been heaped upon her worthy consort. He looked
about for Carmen. She was not with her foster-mother, nor
did his inquiry reveal her whereabouts. He smiled sadly, as
he thought of her out on the shales, her customary refuge
when storms broke. He started in search of her; but as he
passed through the <i>plaza</i> Ma&ntilde;uela Cortez met him. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;is the little Carmen to go to jail, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stopped short. &ldquo;Ma&ntilde;uela&ndash;&ndash;why do you say that?&rdquo;
he asked hurriedly, his heart starting to beat like a trip-hammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Padre, I saw the constable, Fernando, take her
into Don Mario&rsquo;s house some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; uttered an exclamation and started for the house of
the Alcalde. Don Mario stood at the door, his huge bulk
denying the priest admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario!&rdquo; panted Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Carmen&ndash;&ndash;you have her
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fernando, who had been sitting just within the door, rose
and came to his chief&rsquo;s side. Jos&egrave; felt his brain whirling.
Fernando stepped outside and took his arm. The Alcalde&rsquo;s
unlovely face expanded in a sinister leer. &ldquo;It is permissible
to place even a priest in the stocks, if he becomes <i>loco</i>,&rdquo; he
said significantly.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; tightened his grip upon himself. Fernando spoke
quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was necessary to take the girl in custody, too, Padre.
But do not worry; she is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you have no right to take her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, calm yourself. What right had you
to separate her from her father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diego is not her father! He lies! And, Don Mario, you
have no authority but his&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page226' name='book2_page226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; calmly interrupted the Alcalde.
&ldquo;I have a much higher authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stared dully at him. &ldquo;Whose, then?&rdquo; he muttered,
scarce hearing his own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop&rsquo;s, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; answered Don Mario, with a
cruel grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop! But&ndash;&ndash;the old man&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, but the Bishop is fairly young, you know.
That is, the new one&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new one!&rdquo; cried the uncomprehending Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, the new Bishop&ndash;&ndash;formerly Se&ntilde;or
Don Wenceslas Ortiz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; beat the air feebly as his hand sought his damp brow.
His confused brain became suddenly stagnant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; put in Fernando gently, pitying the
priest&rsquo;s agony. &ldquo;You had not heard the news. Don Mario
received letters to-day. The old Bishop of Cartagena died
suddenly some days ago, and Don Wenceslas at once received
the temporary appointment, until the vacancy can be permanently
filled. There is talk of making Cartagena an archbishopric,
and so a new bishop will not be appointed until
that question is settled. Meanwhile, Don Wenceslas administers
the affairs of the Church there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; stammered the stunned priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; interrupted Don Mario, laughing
aloud; &ldquo;the good Don Wenceslas no doubt has learned of
the beautiful Carmen, and he cannot permit her to waste her
loveliness in so dreary a place as Simit&iacute;. And so he summons
her to Cartagena, in care of his agent, Padre Diego, who
awaits the girl now in Banco to conduct her safely down the
river. At least, this is what Padre Diego writes me. <i>Bien</i>,
it is the making of the girl, to be so favored by His Grace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; staggered and would have fallen, had not Fernando
supported him. Don Mario turned into his house. But as he
went he spitefully hurled back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, whom have you to blame but yourself?
You keep a child from her suffering father&ndash;&ndash;you give
all your time to her, neglecting the other poor children of
your parish&ndash;&ndash;you send Rosendo into the mountains to search
for La Libertad&ndash;&ndash;you break your agreement with me, for you
long ago said that we should work together&ndash;&ndash;is it not so?
You find gold in the mountains, but you do not tell me. <i>Na</i>,
you work against me&ndash;&ndash;you oppose my authority as Alcalde&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
you opposed even the authority of the good Bishop&ndash;&ndash;may
he rest with the Saints! You have not made a good
priest for Simit&iacute;, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>&ndash;&ndash;<i>na</i>, you have made a very bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page227' name='book2_page227'></a>227</span>
one! And now you wonder that the good Don Wenceslas
takes the girl from you, to bring her up in the right way.
<i>Caramba</i>! if it is not already too late to save her from your
bad teachings!&rdquo; His voice steadily rose while he talked, and
ended in a shrill pipe.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; made as if to reach him; but Fernando held him back.
The Alcalde got quickly within the house and secured the
door. &ldquo;Go now to your home, Padre,&rdquo; urged Fernando; &ldquo;else
I shall call help and put you in the stocks, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will enter that house! I will take the child from
him!&rdquo; shouted Jos&egrave; desperately, struggling to gain the Alcalde&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Padre!&rdquo; cried Fernando, holding to the
frenzied man. &ldquo;The little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;she is not in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;there! Then where is she, Fernando?&ndash;&ndash;for God&rsquo;s
sake tell me!&rdquo; appealed the stricken priest. Great beads of
perspiration stood upon his face, and tears rolled down his
drawn cheeks.</p>
<p>Fernando could not but pity him. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; he said
gently; &ldquo;come away. I give you my word that the girl is not
in the house of the Alcalde. But I am not permitted to say
where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will search every house in Simit&iacute;!&rdquo; cried the priest
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, you would not find her. Come, I will go home
with you.&rdquo; He took Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm again and led him, blindly
stumbling, to the parish house.</p>
<p>By this time the little town was agog with excitement.
People ran from house to house, or gathered on the street
corners, discussing the event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; shrilled one wrinkled beldame, &ldquo;but Simit&iacute;
was very quiet until the <i>Cura</i> came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;say, rather, until that wicked
little hada was brought here by Rosendo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, she is an <i>hada</i>!&rdquo; put in a third; &ldquo;she cured Juanita
of goitre by her charms! I saw it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! she works with the evil one. I myself saw her
come from the old church on the hill one day! <i>Bien</i>, what
was she doing? I say, she was talking with the bad angel
which the blessed Virgin has locked in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have seen her coming from the cemetery. She
talks with the buzzards that roost on the old wall, and they
are full of evil spirits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she brought the plague two years ago&ndash;&ndash;who knows?&rdquo;
piped another excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe</i>? But it was not the real plague, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page228' name='book2_page228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, and that proves that she caused it, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, <i>se&ntilde;ora</i>, she cast a spell on the town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sat in his little house like one in a dream. Fernando
remained with him. Do&ntilde;a Maria had gone to the jail to see
Rosendo. Juan had returned that morning to Bodega Central,
and L&aacute;zaro was at work on the plantation across the lake.
Jos&egrave; thought bitterly that the time had been singularly well
chosen for the <i>coup</i>. Don Mario&rsquo;s last words burned through
his tired brain like live coals. In a sense the Alcalde was
right. He had been selfishly absorbed in the girl. But he
alone, excepting Rosendo, had any adequate appreciation of
the girl&rsquo;s real nature. To the stagnant wits of Simit&iacute; she was
one of them, but with singular characteristics which caused
the more superstitious and less intelligent to look upon her
as an uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.</p>
<p>Moreover, Jos&egrave; had duped Don Mario with assurances of
co&ouml;peration. He had allowed him to believe that Rosendo was
searching for La Libertad, and that he should participate in
the discovery, if made. Had his course been wholly wise,
after all? He could not say that it had.</p>
<p>But&ndash;&ndash;God above! it was all to save an innocent child from
the blackest of fates! If he had been stronger himself, this
never could have happened. Or, perhaps, if he had not allowed
himself to be lulled to sleep by a fancied security bred
of those long months of quiet, he might have been awake and
alert to meet the enemy when he returned to the attack. Alas!
the devil had left him for a season, and Jos&egrave; had laid down
&ldquo;the shield of faith,&rdquo; while he lost himself in the intellectual
content which the study of the new books purchased with his
ancestral gold had afforded. But evil sleeps not; and with a
persistency that were admirable in a better cause, it returned
with unbated vigor at the moment the priest was off his
guard.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dawn broke upon a sleepless night for Jos&egrave;. The Alcalde
had sent word that Fernando must remain with the priest,
and that no visits would be permitted to Rosendo in the jail.
Jos&egrave; had heard nothing from Carmen, and, though often during
the long night he sought to know, as she would, that God&rsquo;s
protection rested upon her; and though he sought feebly to
prove the immanence of good by knowing no evil, the morning
found him drawn and haggard, with corroding fear gnawing
his desolate heart. Fernando remained mute; and Do&ntilde;a
Maria could only learn that the constable had been seen leading
the girl into Don Mario&rsquo;s house shortly after Rosendo&rsquo;s
arrest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page229' name='book2_page229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>At an early hour the people, buzzing with excitement, assembled
for the trial, which was held in the town hall, a long,
empty adobe house of but a single room, with dirt floor, and
a few rough benches. The Alcalde occupied a broken chair
at one end of the room. The trial itself was of the simplest
order: any person might voice his opinion; and the final
verdict was left to the people.</p>
<p>In a shaking voice, his frame tremulous with nervous agitation,
Rosendo recounted the birth of the child at Badillo,
and the manner of her coming into his family. He told of
Diego&rsquo;s appointment to Simit&iacute;, and of the loss of his own
daughter. Waxing more and more energetic as his recital
drew out, he denounced Diego as the prince of liars, and as
worthy of the violent end which he was certain to meet if
ever that renegade priest should venture near enough for him
to lay his hands upon him. The little locket was produced,
and all present commented on the probable identity of the
girl&rsquo;s parents. Many affected to detect a resemblance to Diego
in the blurred photograph of the man. Others scouted the
idea. Don Mario swore loudly that it could be no other.
Diego had often talked to him, sorrowfully, and in terms of
deepest affection, about the beautiful woman whose love he
had won, but whom his vows of celibacy prevented from making
his lawful wife. The Alcalde&rsquo;s recital was dramatic to a
degree, and at its close several excitedly attempted to address
the multitude at the same time.</p>
<p>Oratory flowed on an ever rising tide, accompanied by
much violent gesticulation and expectoration by way of emphasis.
At length it was agreed that Diego had been, in times
past, a bad man, but that the verbal proofs which he had
given the Alcalde were undoubtedly valid, inasmuch as the
Bishop stood behind them&ndash;&ndash;and Don Mario assured the people
that they were most certainly vouched for by His Grace. The
day was almost carried when the eloquent Alcalde, in glowing
rhetoric, painted the splendid future awaiting the girl, under
the patronage of the Bishop. How cruel to retain her in
dreary little Simit&iacute;, even though Diego&rsquo;s claim still remained
somewhat obscure, when His Grace, learning of her talents,
had summoned her to Cartagena to be educated in the convent
for a glorious future of service to God! Ah, that a like beautiful
career awaited all the children of Simit&iacute;!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; at length forced himself before the people and begged
them to listen to him. But, when he opened his mouth, the
words stumbled and halted. For what had he to say? To
tell these people that he was striving to educate the girl away
from them was impossible. To say that he was trying to save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page230' name='book2_page230'></a>230</span>
her from the Church would be fatal. And to reiterate that
Diego&rsquo;s claim was a fabrication, added nothing of value to
the evidence, for what did he know of the child&rsquo;s parentage?
He feebly begged them to wait until Diego&rsquo;s claim had been
either corroborated or annulled. But no; they had the Bishop&rsquo;s
corroboration, and that sufficed. &ldquo;And, <i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; cried Don
Mario, interrupting the priest in a loud voice, &ldquo;if we oppose
the Bishop, then will he send the government soldiers to us&ndash;&ndash;and
you know what&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cielo</i>, yes!&rdquo; came from the multitude in one voice.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank down thoroughly beaten. His hands were tied.
The case now rested with her God.</p>
<p>The people drew apart in little groups to discuss the matter.
Don Mario&rsquo;s beady eyes searched them, until he was
certain of the way the tide was flowing. Then he rose and
called for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, <i>amigos y amigas</i>,&rdquo; he began with immense dignity;
&ldquo;what say you if we sum up the case as follows: The proofs
have the support of the Bishop, and show that the girl is the
daughter of Padre Diego. Rosendo is guilty of having kept
her from her own father, and for that he should be severely
punished. Let him be confined in the jail for six months, and
be forced to pay to us a fine of one thousand <i>pesos oro</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! but he has no such sum,&rdquo; cried the people
with mouths agape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, I say he can get it!&rdquo; retorted the Alcalde, looking
meaningly at Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;And he should pay it for depriving the
child of a father&rsquo;s love and the religious instruction which he
would have given her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; jumped to his feet. &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; he cried, playing his
last card. &ldquo;Will you not remember that more than that
amount is due Rosendo for the care of the child? Who will
repay him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whimsical, fickle people broke into excited exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Cura</i> is right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Rosendo pay no fine&ndash;&ndash;he has no gold, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut down the sentence, Don Mario. We do not like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde saw that he had gone a bit too far. &ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>,
then,&rdquo; he amended. &ldquo;We will cancel both the fine and Padre
Diego&rsquo;s debt to Rosendo, and the sentence shall be reduced to&ndash;&ndash;what
say you all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month in the jail, Don Mario, no more,&rdquo; suggested one.</p>
<p>An exclamation of approval from the crowd drowned the
protest which Jos&egrave; sought vainly to voice. Rosendo rose
quickly; but Fernando and others seized him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page231' name='book2_page231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, it is approved,&rdquo; bawled the Alcalde, waving his thick
arms. &ldquo;Take the prisoner to the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i>, <i>Se&ntilde;or Polic&iacute;a</i>,&rdquo; turning
to the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the girl, Se&ntilde;or the Alcalde&ndash;&ndash;when will you send her
to her father?&rdquo; called some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Don Mario, she must be taken to Padre Diego at
once,&rdquo; piped a woman&rsquo;s shrill voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; shouted the Alcalde, following his words with a
long, coarse laugh, &ldquo;I was wise enough to know what you
would decide, and sent the girl down the river last night!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 25</h2>
</div>
<p>The candles and smoky oil lamps of Banco threw a fitful
shimmer out upon the great river, casting huge, spectral
shadows across its muddy, swirling waters, and seeming
rather to intensify the blackness that lay thick and menacing
upon its restless bosom. Rivermen who follow their hazardous
calling along the Magdalena do not lightly risk the dangers
of travel by night in their native canoes, when at any moment
a false stroke, a sudden crash against a tossing forest tree,
and a cry through the inky blackness, might sound to the
straining ears of hushed listeners on the distant banks the
elements of another of the mighty river&rsquo;s grim nocturnal
tragedies.</p>
<p>But on the night following the trial of Rosendo in distant
Simit&iacute; a canoe stole like a thing ashamed through the heavy
shadows along the river&rsquo;s margin, and poked its blunt nose
into the ooze at the upper edge of the town. Its two scantily
clad <i>bogas</i>, steaming with perspiration and flecked with mud
from the charged waters, sprang lightly from the frail craft
and quickly made it fast to one of the long stilts upon which
a ramshackle frame house rested. Then they assisted the
third occupant of the canoe, a girl, to alight; and together
they wended their way up the slippery bank and toward the
town above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, <i>compadre</i>!&rdquo; ejaculated one of the men, stumbling
into a deep rut, &ldquo;it is well you know where we go.
<i>Hombre</i>! but I travel no more on the river by night. And,
<i>compadre</i>, we had best ask Padre Diego to offer a candle to
the Virgin for our safe arrival, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man chuckled. &ldquo;To be sure, friend Julio. Don
Diego has much influence with virgins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>! I like not his dirty work.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page232' name='book2_page232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, amigo</i>, what would you? You are well paid; and
besides, you score against that baby-faced priest, Jos&egrave;, who
drove you out of Simit&iacute; because you were not married to your
woman. You cannot complain, <i>compadre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> I have yet to see the color of the <i>pesos</i>. I
do not much trust your Padre Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, amigo</i>, a bit of rum will put new life into your soaked
gizzard. <i>Cierto</i>, this trip down the river was a taste of purgatory;
but you know we may as well get used to it here, for
when we <i>pobres</i> are dead who will buy Masses to get us out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; muttered the other sullenly, as he stumbled
on through the darkness, &ldquo;but if we have no money the priests
will let us burn forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl went along with the men silently and without complaint,
even when her bare feet slipped into the deep ruts in
the trail, or were painfully bruised and cut by the sharp stones
and bits of wood that lay in the narrow path. Once she fell.
The man addressed as Julio assisted her to her feet. The
other broke into a torrent of profane abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, Ricardo,</i>&rdquo; interrupted Julio, &ldquo;hold your foolish tongue
and let the girl alone! You and I have cursed all the way
from Simit&iacute;, but she has made no complaint. She shames
me. <i>Caramba</i>, I wish I were well out of this business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later they struck one of the main thoroughfares.
Then the men stopped to draw on their cotton shirts
and trousers before entering the town. The road was better
here, and they made rapid progress. The night was far spent,
and the streets were deserted. In the main portion of the
town ancient Spanish lamps, hanging uncertainly in their
sconces against old colonial houses, threw a feeble light into
the darkness. Before one of the better of these houses Julio
and the girl were halted by their companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is here that the holy servant of God
lives. <i>Caramba</i>, but may his <i>garraf&oacute;n</i> be full!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the open door and mounted the stone steps.
On the floor above they paused in the rotunda, and Ricardo
called loudly. A side door opened and a young woman appeared,
holding a lighted candle aloft. Ricardo greeted her
courteously. &ldquo;<i>El Se&ntilde;or Padre, se&ntilde;orita Ana?</i>&rdquo; he said, bowing
low. &ldquo;You will do us the favor to announce our arrival,
no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stared uncomprehendingly at the odd trio.
&ldquo;The Padre is not here,&rdquo; she finally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios y diablo!</i>&rdquo; cried Ricardo, forgetting his courtesy.
&ldquo;But we have risked our skins to bring him the brat, and he
not here to receive and reward us! <i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page233' name='book2_page233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Ricardo, he is out with friends to-night&ndash;&ndash;he may
return at any moment. Who is the girl? And why do you
bring her here?&rdquo; She stepped forward, holding the candle
so that its light fell full upon her face. As she did this the
girl darted toward her and threw herself into the woman&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anita!&rdquo; she cried, her voice breaking with emotion,
&ldquo;Anita&ndash;&ndash;I am Carmen! Do you not know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman fell back in astonishment. &ldquo;Carmen! What!
The little Carmen, my father&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anita, I am padre Rosendo&rsquo;s Carmen&ndash;&ndash;and yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana clasped the girl in her arms. &ldquo;<i>Santa Maria</i>, child!
What brings you here, of all places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ricardo stepped forward to explain. &ldquo;As you may see,
se&ntilde;orita, it is we who have brought her here, at the command
of her father, Padre Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;orita. And, since you say he is not in, we must
wait until he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stood speechless with amazement. Carmen
clung to her, while Ricardo stood looking at them, with a
foolish leer on his face. Julio drew back into the shadow of
the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, se&ntilde;orita</i>,&rdquo; said Ricardo, stepping up to the child
and attempting to take her arm, &ldquo;we will be held to account
for the girl, and we must not lose her. <i>Caramba!</i> For then
would the good Padre damn us forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen shrank away from him. Julio emerged swiftly
from the shadow and laid a restraining hand on Ricardo. The
woman tore Carmen from his grasp and thrust the girl behind
herself. &ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, friend Ricardo, we are all responsible for
her,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;But you are tired and hungry&ndash;&ndash;is it
not so? Let me take you to the <i>cocina</i>, where you will find
roast pig and a bit of red rum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes dilated. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> my throat
is like the ashes of purgatory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the woman, holding Carmen tightly by
the hand and leading the way down the steps to the kitchen
below. Arriving there, she lighted an oil lamp and hurriedly
set out food and a large <i>garraf&oacute;n</i> of Jamaica rum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, <i>compadre</i>, is a part of your reward. And we will
now wait until Padre Diego arrives, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the men ate and drank voraciously, interpolating
their actions at frequent intervals with bits of vivid comment
on their river trip, the woman cast many anxious glances
toward the steps leading to the floor above. From time to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page234' name='book2_page234'></a>234</span>
time she replenished Ricardo&rsquo;s glass, and urged him to drink.
The man needed no invitation. Physical exhaustion and short
rations while on the river had prepared him for just what the
woman most desired to accomplish, and as glass after glass of
the fiery liquor burned its way down his throat, she saw his
scant wit fading, until at last it deserted him completely,
and he sank into a drunken torpor. Then, motioning to Julio,
who had consumed less of the rum, she seized the senseless
Ricardo by the feet, and together they dragged him out into
the <i>patio</i> and threw him under a <i>platano</i> tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;orita&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began Julio in remonstrance, as thoughts
of Diego&rsquo;s wrath filtered through his befuddled brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, <i>hombre</i>!&rdquo; she commanded, turning upon him.
&ldquo;If you lay a hand upon this child my knife shall find your
heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;my pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did Padre Diego say he would give you?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three <i>pesos oro</i>&ndash;&ndash;and rations,&rdquo; replied the man thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, then, and I will bring you the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still retaining Carmen&rsquo;s hand, she mounted the steps, listening
cautiously for the tread of her master. Reaching the rotunda
above, she drew Carmen into the room from which she
had emerged before, and, bidding her conceal herself if Diego
should arrive, took her wallet and hastily descended to where
the weaving Julio waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, handing him the
money. &ldquo;Now do you go&ndash;&ndash;at once! And do not remain in
Banco, or Padre Diego will surely make you trouble. Your
life is not safe here now. Go!&rdquo; She pointed to the door; and
Julio, impressed with a sense of his danger, lost no time in
making his exit.</p>
<p>Returning to Carmen, the woman seated herself and drew
the girl to her. &ldquo;Carmen, child!&rdquo; she cried, trembling, as her
eyes searched the girl. &ldquo;Tell me why you are here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Anita dear,&rdquo; murmured the girl, nestling
close to the woman and twining an arm about her neck; &ldquo;except
that day before yesterday the Alcalde put padre Rosendo
into the jail&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anita dear. And then, when I was going to see him,
Fernando ran out of Don Mario&rsquo;s house and told me I must go
in and see the Alcalde. Julio Gomez and this man Ricardo
were there talking with Don Mario in the <i>patio</i>. Then they
threw a <i>ruana</i> over me and carried me out through the <i>patio</i>
and around by the old church to the Boque trail. When we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page235' name='book2_page235'></a>235</span>
got to the trail they made me walk with them to the Inanea
river, where they put me into a canoe. They paddled fast,
down to the Boque river; then to the Magdalena; and down
here to Banco. They did not stop at all, except when steamboats
went by&ndash;&ndash;oh, Anita, I never saw a steamboat before!
What big, noisy things they are! But Padre Jos&egrave; had often
told me about them. And when the big boats passed us they
made me lie down in the canoe, and they put the <i>ruana</i> over
me and told me if I made any noise they would throw me into
the river. But I knew if I just kept still and knew&ndash;&ndash;really
<i>knew</i>&ndash;&ndash;that God would take care of me, why, He would. And,
you see, He did, for He brought me to you.&rdquo; A tired sigh
escaped her lips as she laid her head on the woman&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;oh, <i>Santa Maria</i>!&rdquo; moaned the woman, &ldquo;you are
not safe here! What can I do?&ndash;&ndash;what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Anita dear, you can know that God is here, can&rsquo;t
you? I knew that all the way down the river. And, oh, I am
so glad to see you! Why, just think, it is eight years since you
used to play with me! And now we will go back to Simit&iacute;,
will we not, Anita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray to the Virgin to help us, child! You may have influence
with her&ndash;&ndash;I have none, for my soul is lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Anita dear, that is not true! You and I are both
God&rsquo;s children, and He is right here with us. All we have to
do is to know it&ndash;&ndash;just really <i>know</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, tell me, quick&ndash;&ndash;Diego may be here any moment&ndash;&ndash;why
did he send Ricardo for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl became very serious. &ldquo;Anita dear, Padre Diego
says I am his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;his daughter&ndash;&ndash;that he is my father. But&ndash;&ndash;is it really
so, Anita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i>&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;What a beast!&ndash;&ndash;what
a beast! He saw you in Simit&iacute; when he was last there&ndash;&ndash;and
you are now a beautiful&ndash;&ndash;No, child, you are not his
daughter! The wretch lies&ndash;&ndash;he is a sink of lies! He is rotten
with sin! Oh, <i>Dios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Anita dear, he is not a beast&ndash;&ndash;we must love
him, for he is God&rsquo;s child, too,&rdquo; said Carmen, patting the
woman&rsquo;s wet cheek with her soft hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He!&ndash;&ndash;God&rsquo;s child!&rdquo; She broke into a shrill of laughter.
&ldquo;<i>Carita</i>, he is Satan himself! You do not know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that what you think you see is God&rsquo;s child,
Anita dear; but that what you think you see stands for God&rsquo;s
child, and isn&rsquo;t real. And if we know that, why, we will see
the real child of God&ndash;&ndash;the real man&ndash;&ndash;and not what you call
a beast.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page236' name='book2_page236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>Ana apparently did not hear. Her thought was with the
future. Carmen looked about the room. &ldquo;Oh, Anita,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, &ldquo;what a beautiful place, and what beautiful things
you have!&rdquo; She rubbed the tile floor with her bare foot.
&ldquo;Why, Anita dear, it is just like the palaces Padre Jos&egrave; has
told me about!&rdquo; She walked around the room, touching the
various toilet articles on the dresser, passing her hands carefully
over the upholstered chairs, and uttering exclamations of
wonder and delight. &ldquo;Anita&ndash;&ndash;Anita dear! Why, it is a palace!
Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked up with a wan smile. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>, they
are nothing. They are all cheap trinkets&ndash;&ndash;nothing compared
with what there is in the big world beyond us. You poor dear,
you have lived all your life in miserable little Simit&iacute;, and you
haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea of what there is in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Anita dear, Simit&iacute; is beautiful,&rdquo; the girl protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; The woman laughed aloud. &ldquo;My dear, simple
little girl! You have seen only this poor room, and you
think it wonderful. I have been to Barranquilla and Cartagena
with Padre Diego, and have seen houses a thousand times
more beautiful than this. And yet, even those are nothing to
what there is in the world outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen went to the bed and passed her hand over the
white counterpane. &ldquo;Anita&ndash;&ndash;why, is this&ndash;&ndash;is this your&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, it is my bed. You have never seen a real
bed, poor little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the child&rsquo;s eyes were wide with wonder&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it is so
soft&ndash;&ndash;you sink way into it&ndash;&ndash;oh, so soft&ndash;&ndash;like the heron&rsquo;s feathers!
I didn&rsquo;t sleep at all in the canoe&ndash;&ndash;and I am so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed lamb!&rdquo; cried the woman, springing up and
clasping the girl in her arms. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;what can I do? When
he returns, he may come right up here! <i>Santa Maria</i>, help
me!&ndash;&ndash;what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anita&ndash;&ndash;let me sleep in your bed&ndash;&ndash;it is so soft&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
looking down dubiously at her muddy feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind them, child.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s face had set in
grim determination. She went to the dresser and took out a
small stiletto, which she quickly concealed in the bosom of
her dress. &ldquo;Get right in, just as you are! I will take care of
Diego, if he comes! <i>Santa Maria</i>, I will&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anita dear,&rdquo; murmured the girl, sinking down between
the white sheets, &ldquo;you and I will just <i>know</i> that God is everywhere,
and that He will take care of us, and of Padre Diego
too.&rdquo; With a sigh of contentment the child closed her eyes.
&ldquo;Anita dear,&rdquo; she whispered softly, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t He good to bring
me right to you? And to-morrow we will go back to Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page237' name='book2_page237'></a>237</span>
to padre Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;and Padre Jos&egrave;&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and Cantar-las-horas&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&rsquo;t seen him for such a long time&ndash;&ndash;such
a long&ndash;&ndash;long&ndash;&ndash;Anita dear, I&ndash;&ndash;love&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child dropped asleep, just as a heavy step fell outside
the door. Ana sprang up and extinguished the lamp, then
went quickly out into the rotunda. Padre Diego was standing
on the top step, puffing and weaving unsteadily. The woman
hurried to him and passed an arm about his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a tone of feigned solicitation. &ldquo;I
feared you had met with an accident! My heart beats like
the patter of rain! Why do you stay out so late and cause me
worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bloated face of the man leered like a Jack-o&rsquo;-lantern.
&ldquo;Spiritual retreat, my love&ndash;&ndash;spiritual retreat,&rdquo; he muttered
thickly. &ldquo;Imbibing the spirits, you know.&rdquo; He laughed heavily
at his coarse joke.</p>
<p>The woman gave him a look of inexpressible disgust. &ldquo;But
you are home safe, at any rate,&rdquo; she said in a fawning voice;
&ldquo;and my fear is quieted. Come now, and I will help you into
bed. Not in there!&rdquo; she cried, as he lurched toward the door
of the room where Carmen lay; &ldquo;in your own room to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swayed to and fro before her, as she stood with her
back against the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nombre de Dios</i>!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but you grow daily more
unkind to your good Padre! <i>Bien</i>, it is well that I have a
fresh little housekeeper coming!&rdquo; He made again as if to
enter the room. The woman threw her arms about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she appealed, &ldquo;have you ceased to love your
Anita? She would spend this night alone; and can you not
favor her this once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; he croaked in peevish suspicion, &ldquo;but I think
you have a paramour in there. <i>Bien</i>, I will go in and shrive
his wicked soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to tell you!&rdquo; cried the desperate woman, her
hand stealing to the weapon concealed in her dress. &ldquo;Pepito
came this evening with the case of <i>Oporto</i> which you ordered
long ago from Spain. I put it in your study, for I knew you
would want to sample it the moment you returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; he cried, turning upon her, &ldquo;why do you not
tell me important things as soon as I arrive? I marvel that
you did not wait until morning to break this piece of heavenly
news! <i>Bien</i>, come to the study, and you shall open a bottle
for me. <i>Dios</i>! but my throat is seared with Don Antonio&rsquo;s
vile rum! My parched soul panteth for the wine of the gods
that flows from sunny Spain! <i>Caramba</i>, woman, give yourself
haste!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page238' name='book2_page238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>Suffering himself to be led by her, he staggered across the
rotunda and into the room where long before he had entertained
for a brief hour Don Jorge and the priest Jos&egrave;. Ana
quickly broke the neck of a bottle of the newly arrived wine
and gave him a generous measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God in heaven!&rdquo; murmured the besotted priest, sinking
into a chair and sipping the beverage; &ldquo;it is the nectar of
Olympus&ndash;&ndash;triple distilled through tubes of sunlight and perfumed
with sweet airs and the smiles of voluptuous <i>houris</i>!
Ah, Lord above, you are good to your little Diego! Another
sip, my lovely Ana&ndash;&ndash;and bring me the cigarettes. And come,
fat lass, do you sit beside me and twine your graceful arms
about my neck, while your soft breath kisses my old cheek!
Ah, <i>Dios</i>, who would not be human! <i>Caramba</i>! the good God
may keep His heaven, if He will but give me the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana drew his head against her bosom and murmured hypocritical
words of endearment in his ear, while she kept his
glass full. Diego babbled like a child. He nodded; struggled
to keep awake; and at length fell asleep with his head on her
shoulder. Then she arose, and, assured that he would be
long in his stupor, extinguished the light and hurried to her
own room.</p>
<p>Carmen was sleeping peacefully. The woman bent over
her with the lighted candle and looked long and wistfully.
&ldquo;Ah, <i>Santa Maria</i>!&rdquo; she prayed, &ldquo;if you will but save her, you
may do what you will with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears flowed freely down her cheeks as she turned to the
door and threw the bolt. Coming back to the bed, she again
bent over the sleeping girl. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen</i>!&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;how beautiful! Like an angel! <i>Dios m&iacute;o</i>&ndash;&ndash;and that beast,
he has seen her, and he would&ndash;&ndash;ah, <i>Dios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going again to the dresser, she took from a drawer a sandalwood
rosary. Then she returned to the bed and knelt beside
the child. &ldquo;Blessed Virgin,&rdquo; she prayed, while her hot tears
fell upon the beads, &ldquo;I am lost&ndash;&ndash;lost! Ah, I have not told my
beads for many years&ndash;&ndash;I cannot say them now! <i>Santa Virgen</i>,
pray for me&ndash;&ndash;pray for me&ndash;&ndash;and if I kill him to-morrow, tell
the blessed Saviour that I did it for the child! Ah, <i>Santa
Virgen</i>, how beautiful she is&ndash;&ndash;how pure&ndash;&ndash;what hair&ndash;&ndash;she is
from heaven&ndash;&ndash;<i>Santa Virgen</i>, you will protect her?&rdquo; She kissed
the cross repeatedly. &ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios</i>&ndash;&ndash;she is so beautiful, so
pure&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen moved slightly, and the woman rose hastily from
her knees. &ldquo;Anita dear,&rdquo; murmured the child, &ldquo;Jesus waked
Lazarus&ndash;&ndash;out of his&ndash;&ndash;sleep. Anita, why do you not come?
I am waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page239' name='book2_page239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, yes! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios m&iacute;o</i>!&rdquo; she murmured when
Carmen again slept, &ldquo;I am too wicked to sleep with so pure an
angel!&ndash;&ndash;no, I can not! I must not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spread a light shawl upon the tile floor near the window
and lay down upon it, drawing a lace <i>mantilla</i> over her face to
protect it from the mosquitoes. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen</i>&rdquo;, she murmured
repeatedly, &ldquo;pray the blessed Saviour to protect her
to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;pray for her, <i>Madre de Dios</i>&ndash;&ndash;pray for her!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The piercing shriek of a steamboat whistle roused the
woman just as the first harbingers of dawn spread over the
river a crimson flush that turned it into a stream of blood.
The child was asleep. Ana bent over her and left a kiss on
her forehead. Then she stole out of the room and into the
study. Padre Diego lay sunk in his chair like a monster toad.
The woman threw him a look of utter loathing, and then
hastily descended into the <i>patio</i>. Ricardo lay under the
<i>platano</i> tree, sleeping heavily. She roused him with a kick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, man!&rdquo; she cried, shaking him by the shoulder. &ldquo;Padre
Diego sends you this money, and bids you go. He is well satisfied
with your work.&rdquo; She held out a roll of <i>pesos</i>.</p>
<p>The man, after much vigorous persuasion, got heavily to
his feet. &ldquo;<i>Caramba, se&ntilde;orita</i>!&rdquo; he muttered in a dazed voice.
&ldquo;That last <i>tragito</i>&ndash;&ndash;it was a bit too much, no? But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
I would see the good Padre. <i>Caramba</i>, my poor head! What
rum! But, se&ntilde;orita, do me the great favor to ask the good
Padre to see me one little moment. I must deliver this letter
to him.&rdquo; He fumbled in his wallet and drew out an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not see you, Ricardo. He&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; ejaculated the man loudly, as his senses returned.
&ldquo;But I believe there is something wrong here! <i>Bien</i>,
now I shall see the Padre! I am responsible to him!&rdquo; He
pushed the woman aside and entered the house.</p>
<p>Ana started after him, and seized his arm. A scuffle ensued,
and Ricardo&rsquo;s voice was loud and shrill as they reached the
stairs. The woman clung to him desperately. &ldquo;Ricardo&ndash;&ndash;anything
you ask&ndash;&ndash;double the amount, if you will go! Leave the
house&ndash;&ndash;I will tell the Padre&ndash;&ndash;I will give him the letter&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, but I will see him myself!&rdquo; shouted the lightheaded
Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios y diablo</i>!&rdquo; A heavy voice rolled down from above.
&ldquo;<i>Bien, enamorada</i>, is this the paramour whom you hid in your
room last night? <i>Caramba</i>, you might have chosen a handsomer
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana sank down with a moan and buried her face in her
hands. Diego heavily descended the stairs. &ldquo;Ha, Ricardo!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page240' name='book2_page240'></a>240</span>
he exclaimed, recognizing the man. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, so it is you! And
the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Padre,&rdquo; cried the man excitedly. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita
Ana, she made me drunk last night. I brought the girl&ndash;&ndash;I
waited for you, but the se&ntilde;orita&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, I understand!&rdquo; replied Diego, turning to the
woman.</p>
<p>Ana had risen and was making for the stairs. Diego sprang
to her and seized her by the wrist. With her free hand she
drew the stiletto from her bosom and raised it to strike. Ricardo
saw the movement, and threw himself upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios</i>!&rdquo; cried Diego, as Ricardo felled the woman and
wrenched the weapon from her grasp. &ldquo;My pretty angel, you
have the venom of a serpent! Sly wench! did you think to
deceive your doting Padre? But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios nos guarde</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen, awakened by the noise, had left her bed, and now
stood at the head of the stairs, looking with dilated eyes at the
strange scene being enacted below.</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the group. Ana lay on the ground, her
eyes strained toward the girl. Ricardo bent over her, awaiting
his master&rsquo;s command. He knew now that she had forever
lost her power over the priest. Diego stood like a statue, his
eyes riveted upon Carmen. The girl looked down upon them
from the floor above with an expression of wonder, yet without
fear.</p>
<p>Diego was the first to find his voice. &ldquo;Ah, my pretty one!&rdquo;
he wheedled. &ldquo;My lovely daughter! At last you come to your
lonely padre! Wait for me, <i>hermosissima</i>!&rdquo; He puffed painfully
up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&ndash;&ndash;run!&ndash;&ndash;run! Don&rsquo;t let him come near you&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;
screamed Ana in a voice of horror. Ricardo clapped his hand
heavily over her mouth.</p>
<p>But the child did not move. Diego reached her and seized
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carissima</i>!&rdquo; he panted, feasting his eyes upon her, while a
thrill passed through his coarse frame. &ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios</i>, but
you have grown beautiful! Don Mario was right&ndash;&ndash;you are
surely the most voluptuous object in human form that has
ever crossed my path. <i>Bien</i>, the blessed God is still good to his
little Diego!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started away with her, but was detained by the loud
voice of Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, my pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto, hombre</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Diego. &ldquo;I was about to forget.
But&ndash;&ndash;a father&rsquo;s joy&ndash;&ndash;ah! <i>Bien</i>, come to me to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>, but to-day&ndash;&ndash;now! I have risked my life&ndash;&ndash;and
I have a wife and babes! You will pay me this minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page241' name='book2_page241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, ugly beast, but I will consign you to hell! <i>Maldito</i>!
get you gone! There are more convenient seasons than
this for your business!&rdquo; And, still holding tightly to the girl&rsquo;s
hand, he led her into the study.</p>
<p>The woman turned upon Ricardo with the fury of a tiger.
&ldquo;See now what you have done!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;This will
cost your life, for you have put into his dirty hands the soul of
an angel, and he will damn it! <i>Santa Virgen</i>! If you had
only taken the money I brought you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demon-tongue, I will take it now!&rdquo; He snatched the roll
of bills from her hand and bolted through the door. With a
low moan the woman sank to the ground, while oblivion drew
its sable veil across her mind.</p>
<p>Reaching the study, Diego pushed Carmen into the room
and then followed, closing the door after him and throwing the
iron bolt. Turning about, he stood with arms akimbo upon
his bulging hips and gazed long and admiringly at the girl as
she waited in expectant wonder before him. A smile of satisfaction
and triumph slowly spread over his coarse features.
Then it faded, and his heavy jowls and deep furrows formed
into an expression, sinister and ominous, through which lewdness,
debauchery, and utter corruption looked out brazenly,
defiantly, into the fair, open countenance of the young girl before
him. A sense of weariness and dull pain then seemed to
follow. He shook his heavy head and passed a hand across his
brow, as if to brush aside the confusion left by the previous
night&rsquo;s potations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios</i>!&rdquo; he muttered, falling heavily into a chair,
&ldquo;but had I known you were here, little rosebud, I should have
tried to keep sober.&rdquo; He reached out to grasp her; but she
eluded him and went quickly to the open window, where she
stood looking down into the street below. The morning sunlight,
streaming into the room, engulfed her in its golden flood
and transmuted the child of earth into a creature divinely radiant,
despite the torn gown and stains of river travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, car&iacute;s&iacute;ma</i>,&rdquo; the man wheedled in a small, caressing
voice, &ldquo;where is your greeting to your glad padre? <i>Dios m&iacute;o</i>!&rdquo;
he muttered, his eyes roving over her full figure, &ldquo;but the Virgin
herself was never more lovely! Come, daughter,&rdquo; he
purred, extending his arms; &ldquo;come to a father&rsquo;s heart that now,
praise the Saints! shall ache no more for its lost darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl faced about and looked at him for a few moments.
What her glance conveyed, the man was utterly incapable of
understanding. Then she drew up a chair that stood near the
window, and sinking into it, buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, my smile of heaven! but why weep?&rdquo; chirped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page242' name='book2_page242'></a>242</span>
Diego, affecting surprise. &ldquo;Is it thus you celebrate your homecoming?
Or are these, perchance, fitting tears of joy? <i>Bien</i>,
your padre&rsquo;s doting heart itself weeps that its years of loneliness
are at last ended.&rdquo; He held the sleeve of his gown to his
eyes and sniffed affectedly.</p>
<p>The girl looked up quickly. &ldquo;I am not weeping,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, and what then?&rdquo; he pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just knowing,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;that I was not
afraid&ndash;&ndash;that God was everywhere, even right here&ndash;&ndash;and that
He would not let any harm come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego&rsquo;s eyes widened. Then he burst into a coarse laugh.
&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>! and you ask Him to protect you from your adoring
father! Come here, little wench. You are in your own home.
Why be afraid?&rdquo; He again held out his arms to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid&ndash;&ndash;now,&rdquo; she answered softly. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;I do
not think God will let me come to you. If you were really my
father, He would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s mouth gaped in astonishment. A fleeting sense
of shame swept through his festering mind. Then the lustful
meanness of his corrupted soul welled up anew, and he
laughed brutally. The idea was delightfully novel; the girl
beautifully audacious; the situation piquantly amusing. He
would draw her out to his further enjoyment. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he observed
parenthetically, &ldquo;I judge you are on quite familiar terms
with God, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; she replied, profoundly serious.</p>
<p>The joke was excellent, and he roared with mirth. &ldquo;<i>Bueno,
pues</i>!&rdquo; he commented, reaching over and uncorking with shaking
hand the bottle that stood on the table. Then, filling a glass,
&ldquo;Suppose you thank Him for sending his little Diego this estimable
wine and your own charming self, eh? Then tell me
what He says.&rdquo; Whereat he guffawed loudly and slapped his
bulging sides.</p>
<p>The girl had already bowed her head again in her hands. A
long pause ensued. Diego&rsquo;s beady eyes devoured the beautiful
creature before him. Then he waxed impatient. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, little
Passion flower,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;if you have conveyed to Him
my infinite gratitude, perhaps He will now let you come to
me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked up. A faint smile hovered upon her lips.
&ldquo;I have thanked Him, Padre&ndash;&ndash;for you and for me,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;for you, that you really are His child, even if you don&rsquo;t know
it; and for me that I know He always hears me. That was
what the good man Jesus said, you know, when he waked
Lazarus out of the death-sleep. Don&rsquo;t you remember? And so
I kept thanking Him all the way down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page243' name='book2_page243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>Diego&rsquo;s eyes bulged as if they would pop from his head,
and his mouth fell open wide, but no sound issued therefrom.
The girl went on quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not afraid on the river, Padre. And I was not afraid
to come in here with you. I knew, just as the good man Jesus
did at the tomb of Lazarus, that God had heard me&ndash;&ndash;He just
couldn&rsquo;t be God if He hadn&rsquo;t, you know. And then I remembered
what the good man said about not resisting evil; for, you
know, if we resist evil we make it real&ndash;&ndash;and we never, <i>never</i>
can overcome anything real, can we? So I resisted evil with
good, just as Jesus told us to do. I just <i>knew</i> that God was
everywhere, and that evil was unreal, and had no power at all.
And so the <i>bogas</i> didn&rsquo;t hurt me coming down the river. And
you&ndash;&ndash;you will not either, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped and smiled sweetly at him. Then, very seriously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, one reason why I was not afraid to come in here
with you was that I thought God might want to talk to you
through me, and I could help you. You need help, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man settled back in his chair and stared stupidly at
her. His face expressed utter consternation, confusion, and
total lack of comprehension. Once he muttered under his
breath, &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! she is surely an <i>hada</i>!&rdquo; But Carmen did
not hear him. Absorbed in her mission, she went on earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Padre, we are all channels through which God
talks to people&ndash;&ndash;just like the <i>asequia</i> out there in the street
through which the water flows. We are all channels for divine
love&ndash;&ndash;so Padre Jos&egrave; says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest sat before her like a huge pig, his little eyes
blinking dully, and his great mouth still agape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are never afraid of real things, Padre, you know; and
so I couldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the real &lsquo;you,&rsquo; for that is a child of
God. And the other &lsquo;you&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t real. We are only afraid of our
wrong thoughts. But such thoughts are not really ours, you
know, for they don&rsquo;t come from God. But,&rdquo; she laughed softly,
&ldquo;when I saw you coming up the steps after me this morning&ndash;&ndash;well,
lots of fear-thoughts came to me&ndash;&ndash;why, they just seemed
to come pelting down on me like the rain. But I wouldn&rsquo;t listen
to them. I turned right on them, just as I&rsquo;ve seen Cucumbra
turn on a puppy that was nagging him, and I said, &lsquo;Here, now,
I know what you are; I know you don&rsquo;t come from God; and
anything that doesn&rsquo;t come from God isn&rsquo;t really anything at
all!&rsquo; And so they stopped pelting me. The good man Jesus
knew, didn&rsquo;t he? That&rsquo;s why he said so often, &lsquo;Be not afraid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused again and beamed at him. Her big eyes sparkled,
and her face glowed with celestial light. Diego raised a heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page244' name='book2_page244'></a>244</span>
arm and, groping for the bottle, eagerly drained another glass
of wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that wine makes you happy, don&rsquo;t you, Padre?&rdquo;
she observed, watching him gulp down the heavy liquor. &ldquo;But
it doesn&rsquo;t. It just gives you what Padre Jos&egrave; calls a false
sense of happiness. And when that false sense passes away&ndash;&ndash;for
everything unreal has just <i>got</i> to pass away&ndash;&ndash;why, then
you are more unhappy than you were before. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished Diego now regained his voice. &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>,
girl!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;will you rein that runaway tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; she replied evenly, &ldquo;for it is God who is talking
to you. Don&rsquo;t you hear Him? You ought to, for you are a
priest. You ought to know Him as well as the good man Jesus
did. Padre, can you lay your hands on the sick babies and
cure them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man squirmed uncomfortably for a moment, and then
broke into another brutal laugh. &ldquo;Sick babies! <i>Caramba</i>! but
we find it easier to raise new babies than to cure sick ones!
But&ndash;&ndash;little <i>hada</i>! <i>Hombre</i>! do <i>hadas</i> have such voluptuous
bodies, such plump legs! <i>Madre de Dios</i>, girl, enough of your
preaching! Come to me quick! I hunger for you! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; she answered quietly, &ldquo;I do not want to come
to you. But I want to talk to you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios y diablo</i>! enough of your gab! <i>Caramba</i>! with a
Venus before me do you think I yearn for a sermon? <i>Hombre</i>!
delay it, delay it&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;you do not see <i>me.</i> You are
looking only at your bad thoughts of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! my thoughts, eh?&rdquo; His laugh resembled the snort of
an animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre&ndash;&ndash;and they are <i>very</i> bad thoughts, too&ndash;&ndash;they
don&rsquo;t come from God, and you are <i>so</i> foolish to let them use
you the way you do. Why do you, Padre? for you don&rsquo;t have
to. And you know you see around you only the thoughts that
you have been thinking. Why don&rsquo;t you think good thoughts,
and so see only good things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Mary bless my soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed in mock surprise.
&ldquo;Can it be that I don&rsquo;t see a plump little witch before me, but
only my bad thoughts, eh? Ha! ha! <i>Caramba</i>! that is good!
<i>Bien</i>, then,&rdquo; he coaxed, &ldquo;come to your poor, deluded padre and
let him learn that you are only a thing of thought, and not the
most enchanting little piece of flesh that ever caused a Saint
to fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat silent before him. Her smile had fled, and in
its place sadness and pity were written large upon her wistful
face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page245' name='book2_page245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my little bundle of thought,&rdquo; he coaxed, holding out
his fat, hairy arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; the girl answered firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, then, still afraid, eh?&rdquo; he taunted, with rising anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre; to be afraid would mean that I didn&rsquo;t understand
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Then come to me and prove that you do understand
Him, eh?&rdquo; he suggested eagerly. &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! why do you sit
there like a mummy? Are you invoking curses on the bald
pate of your desolate father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre; I am thanking God all the time that He is here,
and that He will not let you hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s lust-inflamed eyes narrowed and the expression
on his evil face became more sinister. &ldquo;<i>Maldita</i>!&rdquo; he growled,
&ldquo;will you come hither, or must I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She shook her head slowly, and her heavy curls
glistened in the sunlight. &ldquo;No, Padre, God will not let me
come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Panting and cursing softly, the man got slowly to his feet.
&ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios</i>!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;then we will see if your God
will let me come to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose and stood hesitant. Her lips moved rapidly,
though no sound came from them. They were forming the
words of the psalmist, &ldquo;In God have I put my trust: I will not
be afraid what man can do unto me.&rdquo; It was a verse Jos&egrave; had
taught her long since, when his own heart was bursting with
apprehension.</p>
<p>Diego stumbled heavily toward the child. She turned quickly
as if to flee. He thrust out his hand and clutched her dress.
The flimsy calico, frayed and worn, tore its full length, and
the gown fell to the floor. She stopped and turned to face the
man. Her white body glistened in the clear sunlight like a
marble statue.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Por el amor de Dios</i>!&rdquo; ejaculated the priest, straightening
up and regarding her with dull, blinking eyes. Then, like a
tiger pouncing upon a fawn, he seized the unresisting girl in
his arms and staggered back to his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba! Caramba</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed, holding her with one
arm about her waist, and with his free hand clumsily pouring
another glass of wine. &ldquo;Only a thing of thought, eh? <i>Madre
de Dios! Bien</i>, pretty thought, drink with me this thought of
wine!&rdquo; He laughed boisterously at his crude wit, and forced
the glass between her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;am not afraid&ndash;&ndash;I am not afraid,&rdquo; she whispered, drinking.
&ldquo;It cannot hurt me&ndash;&ndash;nor can you. God <i>is</i> here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt you!&rdquo; he panted, setting down the glass and mopping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page246' name='book2_page246'></a>246</span>
his hot brow, as he settled back into the chair again. &ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!
who hurts when he loves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;do&ndash;&ndash;not&ndash;&ndash;love&ndash;&ndash;me, Padre!&rdquo; she gasped under his
tight clutch. &ldquo;You have&ndash;&ndash;only a wrong thought&ndash;&ndash;of me&ndash;&ndash;of
love&ndash;&ndash;of everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>&ndash;&ndash;but you love me, pretty creature, is it not so?&rdquo; he
mocked, holding up her head and kissing her full on the
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I love the <i>real</i> &lsquo;you&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;for that is God&rsquo;s image,&rdquo; she
murmured, struggling to hold her face away from his fetid
breath. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;I do not&ndash;&ndash;love the way that image is&ndash;&ndash;is translated&ndash;&ndash;in
your human mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; he threw himself back and gave noisy vent to
his risibility. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita m&iacute;a</i>! What grand language! Where
did you learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment the girl seemed to forget that she was in
the fell clutches of a demon incarnate. Her thought strayed
back to little Simit&iacute;, to Cucumbra, to Cantar-las-horas, to&ndash;&ndash;ah,
was <i>he</i> searching for her now? And would he come?&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Padre Jos&egrave;; he taught me,&rdquo; she whispered sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave;! <i>Maldito</i>! The curse of God blast him, the
monkey-faced <i>mozo! Caramba</i>! but he will teach you no more!
You have a new master now to give you a few needed lessons,
<i>se&ntilde;orita m&iacute;a</i>, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Diego!&rdquo; her tense voice checked further expression
of his low thought. &ldquo;You have no power to curse anything!
You have no power to harm me, or to teach me anything! God
<i>is</i> here! He <i>will</i> protect me! He keeps all them that love
Him!&rdquo; She gasped again as his clutch tightened about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless, my lily. <i>Caramba</i>! your skin is like the velvet!&rdquo;
He roughly drew the girl up on his knees. &ldquo;To be sure
He will protect you, my <i>mariposa.</i> And He is using me as the
channel, you see&ndash;&ndash;just as you said a few moments ago, eh?&rdquo;
His rude laugh again echoed through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not&ndash;&ndash;using you&ndash;&ndash;at all!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Evil thoughts
are&ndash;&ndash;are using you. And all&ndash;&ndash;they can do&ndash;&ndash;is to kill themselves&ndash;&ndash;and
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Madre Maria</i>! Is such a sad fate in store for me, my
beautiful <i>hada</i>?&rdquo; He chuckled and reached out again for the
bottle. &ldquo;Another little thought of wine, my love. It&rsquo;s only a
thought, you know. Ha! ha! I must remember to tell Don
Antonio of this!&ndash;&ndash;<i>Maldita</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His clumsy movement had upset the bottle. Struggling to
save its contents, he relaxed his hold on Carmen. Like a flash
she wormed her supple body out under his arm, slid to the
floor, and gained the window.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page247' name='book2_page247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios y diablo! Maldita! Maldita</i>!&rdquo; shrilled Diego, aflame
with wrath. &ldquo;Cursed wench! when I lay these hands again
on you&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Struggling to his feet, he made for the girl. But at the
first step the light rug slid along the smooth tiles beneath his
uncertain tread. He threw out an arm and sought to grasp
the table. But as he did so, his foot turned under him. There
was a sharp, snapping sound. With a groan the heavy man
sank to the floor.</p>
<p>For a moment Carmen stood as if dazed. Diego lay very
still. Then the girl picked up her torn dress and approached
him carefully. &ldquo;It was his bad thoughts,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;he
slipped on them; they threw him! I knew it&ndash;&ndash;I just <i>knew</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing to one side, she gained the door, threw back the
bolt, and hurried out into the rotunda. Crouched on the floor,
the stiletto clasped in her hand, sat Ana, her face drenched
with tears, and her chest heaving. When she saw the girl
she sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen! Ah, <i>Dios</i>! your dress!&ndash;&ndash;<i>Madre Maria</i>! I
could not save you; I could not break through the heavy door;
but I can punish him!&rdquo; She burst into a flood of tears and
started into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Anita!&rdquo; cried the girl, throwing herself into the woman&rsquo;s
arms. &ldquo;He is punished! He did not hurt me&ndash;&ndash;God would
not let him! Look! Anita, look!&rdquo; pointing to the body on the
floor.</p>
<p>The woman stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; she whispered
in awed tones, &ldquo;did God strike him dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Anita&ndash;&ndash;but come! No!&rdquo; clinging to the
woman&rsquo;s skirt; &ldquo;Anita dear, do not go in there! Leave him!
Come away with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes were wild, her hair loose and disheveled.
&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but we will make sure that the beast
is dead before we go! And if we leave this blade in his heart,
it may be a warning to others of his kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Anita&ndash;&ndash;no! God will not let you kill him! You must
not! Your murder-thoughts will kill you if you do! Come!
Listen&ndash;&ndash;it is a steamboat whistle! Oh, Anita&ndash;&ndash;if it is going
up the river&ndash;&ndash;we can take it&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ana hesitated. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;leave him? He may&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Anita, yes; leave him with God!&rdquo; pleaded the girl
excitedly. &ldquo;Come away, Anita&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where, child?&rdquo; asked the bewildered woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Simit&iacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;! Never! Why&ndash;&ndash;why, my father would kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Anita dear; he loves you; he prays for you; he wants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page248' name='book2_page248'></a>248</span>
you! Oh, Anita, come! It is right&ndash;&ndash;it is just what God has
planned, I know! Pin my dress together, and then hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman moved as if in a cloud. Mechanically she descended
the stairs and left the house, her hand tightly clasped
by Carmen. Dully she suffered herself to be led hurriedly to
the river. A boat, up-bound, was just docking. The captain
stood leaning over the rail and shouting his commands. Ana
recognized him. It was Captain Julio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Loado sea Dios</i>!&rdquo; murmured the weeping woman, hurrying
up the gang plank with the child. She hastened past the
astonished passengers to the captain and drew him to one
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;Rosendo Ariza&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;of Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;leave
her at Badillo&ndash;&ndash;they will take her over&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; interrupted the captain tenderly. &ldquo;Is it
not time for you to go home, too?&rdquo; He laid a hand on her
shoulder and looked down into her streaming eyes. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
he said quietly. And, leading them down the deck, he opened
the door of a vacant cabin and bade them enter. &ldquo;You can
tell me your story when we are under way,&rdquo; he said, smiling
as he closed the door. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he muttered, his brow clouding
as he strode off. &ldquo;I have been looking for this for some time.
But&ndash;&ndash;the child&ndash;&ndash;Ariza&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;ah, the priest Diego! I think I see&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>!
But we will not tarry long here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the big boat, her two long funnels
vomiting torrents of smoke and sparks, thrust her huge wheel
into the thick waters and, swinging slowly out into mid-stream,
turned her flat nose toward the distant falls of Tequendama.
In one of her aft cabins a woman lay on a cot, weeping hysterically.
Over her bent a girl, with a face such as the masters
have sought in vain. The tenderly whispered words might
have been the lingering echo of those voiced in the little moonlit
death-chamber of Cartagena long agone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anita dear, He is with us, right here. And His arms are
wide open. And He says, &lsquo;Anita, come!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_26' id='CHAPTER_26'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 26</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre dear, why are you so surprised that Padre
Diego did not hurt me? I would have been much more
surprised if he had. You are always so astonished when
evil doesn&rsquo;t happen&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you ever look for good? Why, I
don&rsquo;t ever look for anything else! How could I when I know
that God is everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page249' name='book2_page249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>Jos&egrave; strained her closer to himself. &ldquo;The sense of evil&ndash;&ndash;it
overwhelms me at times, <i>carita</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre dear, why don&rsquo;t you know right then that it is
nothing? If you did, it would fade away, and only good would
overwhelm you.&rdquo; She nestled closer to the man and clasped
her arms more tightly about his neck. &ldquo;Why, Padre,&rdquo; she
resumed, &ldquo;I was not a bit surprised when Captain Julio came
and told us we were near Bodega Central, and that he could
see you and Juan and L&aacute;zaro sitting on the steps of the inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, we were resting for a moment. If a down-river
boat came by we were going to take it. If not, we expected
to go in the canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, what did you intend to do in Banco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, child&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juan and L&aacute;zaro have knives. I saw them. Padre&ndash;&ndash;have
you one, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&ndash;&ndash;<i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, God never fights with knives. Anita had a
knife; but God wouldn&rsquo;t let her use it. He always has better
ways than that. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to Padre Diego,
except that he fell over his wicked thoughts. You know,
Padre dear, somewhere in the Bible you read to me that &lsquo;With
him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to
help us, and to fight our battles.&rsquo; I thought of that when
Padre Diego had his arm around me and held me so tight that
I could hardly breathe. It was only an arm of flesh, after, all,
and it couldn&rsquo;t hold me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; interrupted Juan, coming up from the boat,
&ldquo;if we are to reach Simit&iacute; to-night we must start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bueno</i>, then let us set out,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;, rising. A
muffled sob reached his ears. He turned to the woman huddled
in the shadow of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Ana,&rdquo; he said cheerily; &ldquo;to-night you will again be
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre&ndash;&ndash;I do not go with you. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anita!&rdquo; In an instant Carmen&rsquo;s arms were around her.
&ldquo;When padre Rosendo sees us, you and me, why&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Car&iacute;sima</i>!&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s tears flowed fast while she
hugged the girl to her bosom. &ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;he would drive me
from his house! No&ndash;&ndash;let me stay here. I will get work in the
<i>posada</i>, perhaps. Or Captain Julio will take me to Honda on
his next trip, and get me a place&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must ask him to get a place for us both,&rdquo; interrupted
Carmen, sitting calmly down beside her. &ldquo;And
think, Anita, how sad padre Rosendo will be when he sees the
men come back without us!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page250' name='book2_page250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen! I shall throw myself into the river!&rdquo; cried the
sorrowing woman, rising. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, Anita,&rdquo; returned the girl quickly; &ldquo;it is nothing&ndash;&ndash;just
zero&ndash;&ndash;and you can&rsquo;t drown it! If it would do any good
we would both jump into the river&ndash;&ndash;that is, if God told us to&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t
we? But it doesn&rsquo;t help any to die, you know, for
then we would have it all to do over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, laying a hand on the woman&rsquo;s shoulder,
&ldquo;you do not understand her&ndash;&ndash;neither do I, wholly. But if she
tells you to go with us to Simit&iacute;, why, I think I would go. I
would leave it all with her. You may trust her influence with
Rosendo. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and led her, weeping, but no longer resisting,
down to the canoe. Carmen followed, dancing like an
animated sunbeam. &ldquo;What fun, oh, what fun!&rdquo; she chirped,
clapping her hands. &ldquo;And just as soon as we get home we
will go right up to the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i> and let padre Rosendo out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, chiquita</i>,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, shaking his head mournfully;
&ldquo;we have no power to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, God has,&rdquo; returned the girl, nothing daunted.</p>
<p>Juan pushed the heavily laden canoe from its mooring,
and set its direction toward Simit&iacute;. Silence drew over the little
group, and the hours dragged while the boat crept slowly along
the margin of the great river. The sun had passed its meridian
when the little craft turned into the <i>ca&ntilde;o.</i> To Jos&egrave; the change
brought a most grateful relief. For, though his long residence
in Simit&iacute; had somewhat inured him to the intense heat of
this low region, he had not yet learned to endure it with the
careless indifference of the natives. Besides, his mind was
filled with vivid memories of the horrors of his first river trip.
And he knew that every future experience on the water would
be tinged by them.</p>
<p>In the shaded <i>ca&ntilde;o</i> the sunlight, sifting through the interlocking
branches of ancient palms and <i>caobas</i>, mellowed and
softened into a veil of yellow radiance that flecked the little
stream with splashes of gold. Juan in the prow with the pole
labored in silence. At times he stopped just long enough to
roll a huge cigar, and to feast his bright eyes upon the fair
girl whom he silently adored. L&aacute;zaro, as <i>patron</i>, sat in the
stern, saturnine and unimpassioned. The woman, exhausted
by the recent mental strain, dozed throughout the journey.
Carmen alone seemed alive to her environment. Every foot of
advance unfolded to her new delights. She sang; she chirped;
she mimicked the parrots; she chattered at the excited monkeys.
It was with difficulty that Jos&egrave; could restrain her when
her sharp eyes caught the glint of brilliant Passion flowers and
orchids of gorgeous hue clinging to the dripping trees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page251' name='book2_page251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;they are in us, you know. They
are not out there at all! We see our thoughts of them&ndash;&ndash;and
lots of people wouldn&rsquo;t see anything beautiful about them at
all, just because their thoughts are not beautiful. Padre, we
see&ndash;&ndash;what you said to me once&ndash;&ndash;we see our interpretations of
God&rsquo;s ideas, don&rsquo;t we? That is what I told Padre Diego. But&ndash;&ndash;well,
he will just <i>have</i> to see some day, won&rsquo;t he, Padre dear?
But now let us talk in English; you know, I haven&rsquo;t spoken it
for such a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; gazed at her in rapt silence. What a rare interpretation
of the mind divine was this child! But he wondered why
one so pure and beautiful should attract a mind so carnal as
that of Diego. And yet&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;it is again that law. Good always stirs
up its suppositional opposite. And the most abundant good
and the greatest purity stir up the most carnal elements of the
human mind. All history shows it. The greater the degree
of good, the greater the seeming degree of evil aroused. The
perfect Christ stirred the hatred of a world. Carmen arouses
Diego simply because of her purity. Yet she knows that he
can not harm her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes met the girl&rsquo;s, and she answered his unspoken
thought in the tongue which she was fast adopting. &ldquo;We <i>have</i>
to love him, you know, Padre dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love whom? Diego?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course. We can&rsquo;t help loving him. Oh, not
the &lsquo;him&rsquo; that the human mind looks at, but the real &lsquo;him,&rsquo; you
know&ndash;&ndash;the &lsquo;him&rsquo; that is God&rsquo;s image. And you know there
just isn&rsquo;t any other &lsquo;him,&rsquo; now is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above!&rdquo; murmured Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;if I could but keep my
thought as straight as she does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre dear, your thought <i>is</i> straight. You know,
God&rsquo;s thought is the only thought there really is. Any other
thought has the minus sign, and so it is zero. If we will always
think of the real Padre Diego, and love that, why, the unreal
one will fade away from our thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose, <i>chiquita</i>, that if we love him we will
make him repent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child pondered the question for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, what did you tell me once about the word &lsquo;repent&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes from the Greek word &lsquo;<i>metanoia</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she reflected; &ldquo;but what did you say that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I told you it meant a complete and radical change
of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes brightening.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; waited expectantly. It was heaven to have this girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page252' name='book2_page252'></a>252</span>
before him and to drink in the na&iuml;ve expressions of her active
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, when John the baptiser said, &lsquo;Repent, for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand,&rsquo; did he mean to tell the people
that they must have a complete change of thought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; laughed. And then he grew serious. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;I have no doubt he meant just that. For you have
taught me that there can be no salvation without such a complete
and radical change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said with quick emphasis; &ldquo;for God is mind, you
know. And His thought is the only real thought there is or
can be. The thoughts of mortals are the opposites of His
thoughts, and so they are illusions, and, like all lies, must
pass away. If people want to be immortal, they must think
as God thinks, for He is immortal. They must stop thinking
that there is any power but God. They must stop letting in
thoughts of sickness, of sin, of wickedness, and all those things
that in English you call &lsquo;discord.&rsquo; God says in the Bible, &lsquo;As
the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my thoughts
higher than your thoughts.&rsquo; Well, God is immortal and perfect.
And if we want to be like Him we must think His
thoughts. For our thoughts become&ndash;&ndash;things. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;I see, <i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;sometimes very
clearly&ndash;&ndash;and then again I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>do</i> see!&rdquo; she insisted, getting up on her knees and
facing him. &ldquo;And you see as God sees! And if you hold this
thought always, why, it will&ndash;&ndash;it will be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Externalized; is that what you are trying to say?&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just that. Jesus said, &lsquo;As a man thinketh in his
heart, so is he.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Carmen&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash; What you say is doubtless true in
essence&ndash;&ndash;but I think you have not grasped it all&ndash;&ndash;there are so
many gaps that your simple little system of religion does not
fill in&ndash;&ndash;so many great questions that you do not answer. I
see, in part&ndash;&ndash;and then, again, I don&rsquo;t see at all. And when
you were stolen away from Simit&iacute; I saw nothing but the evil&ndash;&ndash;and
it nearly killed me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl studied him for a few moments. The man had
always been an enigma to her. She could not understand a
nature that soared into the spiritual empyrean one moment,
and in the next fell floundering into the bottomless pit of
materialism. The undulating curve which marked the development
of the Rinc&oacute;n mind was to her a thing incomprehensible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she said at length, a little sadly. &ldquo;When you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page253' name='book2_page253'></a>253</span>
look at the first chapter in the Bible and read there how God
made everything, and man in His image, in the image of Mind,
you see, and are very happy. But when you go on to the
second chapter and read how the Lord God&ndash;&ndash;not God, but the
<i>Lord</i> God&ndash;&ndash;made a man of dirt, and how this dirt man listened
to his false thoughts and fell, why, then you are unhappy.
Don&rsquo;t you see any difference between them? Can&rsquo;t you see
that one is a story of the real creation; and the other is the
human mind&rsquo;s interpretation of the creation&ndash;&ndash;an interpretation
made according to the way the human mind thinks the
creating <i>ought</i> to have been in matter? You told me this
yourself. And the second chapter shows how far the human
mind can go&ndash;&ndash;it shows how limited it is. The human mind
couldn&rsquo;t get any farther than that&ndash;&ndash;couldn&rsquo;t make a man out
of anything but dirt. It couldn&rsquo;t understand the spiritual
creation. And so it made a creation of its own. It couldn&rsquo;t
understand God; and so it made a Lord God, just like itself.
Can&rsquo;t you see? Padre dear, can&rsquo;t you? And if you see, can&rsquo;t
you <i>stick</i> to it and <i>live</i> it, until all the unreal passes away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; smiled into her earnest little face. &ldquo;I will never cease
to try, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we were talking about loving
Diego, weren&rsquo;t we? Yes, you are right, we must try to love
him, for the good Jesus said we must love our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if we love everybody, then we haven&rsquo;t any enemies.
You can&rsquo;t love a real enemy&ndash;&ndash;and so there aren&rsquo;t any real ones.
We see in other people only what is in our own thought. If
we see evil as real, why, then we will see bad men and women
all around us, for we only look at our thoughts. But, if we
look only at God&rsquo;s thoughts&ndash;&ndash;Padre dear, I didn&rsquo;t see anything
but God&rsquo;s thought when Padre Diego had me in his arms. I
knew it wasn&rsquo;t real, but was just the human way of looking
at things. And I knew that love was the great principle of
everything, and that it just couldn&rsquo;t fail, any more than the
principle of algebra could fail to solve my problems. Well,&rdquo;
she concluded with a little sigh, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little girl, you must be patient, very patient, with
your blundering old Padre Jos&egrave;. He is groping for the light&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant, throwing the canoe into imminent danger of
upsetting, the impulsive girl had hurled herself into his lap
and clasped her arms about his neck. Juan and L&aacute;zaro by
a quick and skillful effort kept the craft upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre dear!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say a word
that would make you unhappy&ndash;&ndash;Padre dear, I love you so!
Padre, look at your little girl, and tell her that you love her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clasped her fiercely. &ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I
must not&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;<i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;I adore you!&rdquo; He buried his
face in her shoulder.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page254' name='book2_page254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>Juan made a wry mouth as he looked at the girl in the
priest&rsquo;s arms. Then he suggested that a separation would more
evenly balance the boat. Carmen laughed up at him, but
slipped down into the keel and sat with her head propped
against Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him with twinkling
eyes, &ldquo;I heard L&aacute;zaro say a little while before we started that
he had lived many years in Simit&iacute;, and that it had always
been very quiet until you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ay de m&iacute;!</i>&rdquo; sighed Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;I can readily believe that the
whole world was quiet until I entered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, perhaps you had to come into it to shake it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if ever you go out into
it, with your radical views regarding God and man; and if the
stupid old world will give ear to you, there will be such a
shaking up as it has never experienced since&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;I am not going out into
the world. I shall stay in Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at her, tenderly, wistfully. And then,
while her words still echoed through his mind, a great sigh
escaped him.</p>
<p>Dusk had closed in upon them when the canoe emerged
into the quiet lake. Huge vampire bats, like demons incarnate,
flouted their faces as they paddled swiftly toward the distant
town. Soft evening calls drifted across the placid waters from
the slumbering jungle. Carmen&rsquo;s rich voice mingled with
them; and Juan and L&aacute;zaro, catching the inspiration, broke
into a weird, uncanny boating song, such as is heard only
among these simple folk. As they neared the town the song
of the <i>bogas</i> changed into a series of loud, yodelling halloos;
and when the canoe grated upon the shaly beach, Do&ntilde;a Maria
and a score of others were there to welcome the returned
travelers.</p>
<p>At the sight of Ana, a murmur ran through the crowd.
Do&ntilde;a Maria turned to the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Anita, madre dear,&rdquo; Carmen quickly announced, as
she struggled out of Do&ntilde;a Maria&rsquo;s arms and took the confused
Ana by the hand.</p>
<p>The light of recognition came into Do&ntilde;a Maria&rsquo;s eyes.
Quietly, and without demonstration, she went to the shrinking
woman and, taking the tear-stained face in her hands, impressed
a kiss upon each cheek. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; she said in a low,
tender voice, &ldquo;we have waited long for you, daughter. And
now let us go home.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The glow of dawn had scarce begun to creep timidly across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page255' name='book2_page255'></a>255</span>
the arch of heaven when Fernando knocked at the portal of
Rosendo&rsquo;s house and demanded the custody of Carmen. Jos&egrave;
was already abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Fernando,&rdquo; demanded the priest, &ldquo;what new
outrage is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable flushed with embarrassment. &ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre, a
thousand pardons&ndash;&ndash;but it is the order of the Alcalde, and I
only obey. But&ndash;&ndash;you may knock me down,&rdquo; he added eagerly,
&ldquo;and then I can return to him and say that I could not take the
girl, even by force!&rdquo; The honest fellow, ashamed of his mission,
hung his head. Jos&egrave; seized his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fernando!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what say the people of Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are with you, Padre. They would demand Rosendo&rsquo;s
release, if there were proof that the girl&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, then! we have the proof,&rdquo; broke in Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Rosendo
knows of our return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the guard informed him this morning. The Alcalde,
you know, permits no one to approach the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does he know that Ana is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guard did not tell him, for fear of exciting the old
man. <i>Hombre!</i> I think there is no one in town who would
venture to tell Rosendo that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien pues</i>, Fernando, I think the time has come! Go
quietly back and summon every one to a meeting in the town
hall at once. Tell them&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, I shall know what to tell them. But,&rdquo; anxiously,
&ldquo;Don Mario has the power to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have a greater power,&rdquo; quickly replied the priest,
his thought dwelling on Carmen.</p>
<p>An hour later the town hall was a babel of clacking tongues.
Men, women and children hurried, chattering, to and fro, exchanging
diverse views and speculating eagerly on the probable
outcome of the meeting. Jos&egrave; stood before them, with Carmen&rsquo;s
hand clasped tightly in his. Don Mario, purple and
trembling with rage, was perched upon a chair, vainly trying
to get the ear of the people.</p>
<p>In the midst of the hubbub a hush fell suddenly over the
concourse. All heads turned, and all eyes fastened upon Ana,
as she entered the room and moved timidly toward Jos&egrave;. The
people fell back to make a passage for her. Her shoulders
were bent, and her face was covered with a black <i>mantilla</i>.</p>
<p>Don Mario, as his glance fell upon her, again attempted to
address the multitude. A dozen voices bade him cease. A
strong arm from behind pushed him from the chair. His
craven heart began to quake, and he cast anxious glances toward
the single exit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page256' name='book2_page256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Gently removing the <i>mantilla</i> from the face of the woman,
Jos&egrave; turned her toward the people. &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; he said in a
loud, penetrating voice, &ldquo;behold the work of Diego!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for the effect which he knew would be made
upon this impressionable people. Then, when the loud murmur
had passed, he drew Carmen out before him and, pointing
to her, said dramatically, &ldquo;And shall we also throw this innocent
child to the wolf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assembly broke into a roar. Fists were shaken under
the Alcalde&rsquo;s nose, and imprecations were hurled at him from
all sides. Don Mario drew his soiled handkerchief and mopped
his steaming brow. Then his voice broke out in a shriek:
&ldquo;The soldiers&ndash;&ndash;this day I shall summon them&ndash;&ndash;it is a riot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> He speaks truth!&rdquo; cried a voice from the
crowd. The babel commenced anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers! <i>Caramba!</i> Let Diego have his child!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Maldita!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says it is not his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ana. Clasping Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm to steady herself, she had
turned to confront the excited assembly.</p>
<p>Silence descended upon them all. Jos&egrave; held up his hand.
A sob escaped the woman. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priest Diego had a child&ndash;&ndash;a girl. Her name&ndash;&ndash;it was&ndash;&ndash;Carmen.
The child is&ndash;&ndash;dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> girl, how know you that?&rdquo; shrilled a woman&rsquo;s
excited voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, because I&ndash;&ndash;was&ndash;&ndash;its&ndash;&ndash;mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pandemonium burst upon the room at the woman&rsquo;s words.
Don Mario started for the door, but found his way blocked.
&ldquo;Diego had other children!&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;and this girl is one
of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; cried Ana in a loud voice. &ldquo;I have lived with
him eight years! I know from his own lips that I speak the
truth! See what he has done to me! Would I lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i>! Release Rosendo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will write to the President at Bogot&aacute;! Don Mario
must be removed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> Such an Alcalde!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him send for the soldiers, if he wishes to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the <i>c&aacute;rcel</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a unit the fickle people streamed from the room and
started for the jail. Don Mario was borne along on the heaving
tide. Jos&egrave; and Carmen followed; but Ana fell back and
returned to the house of Rosendo.</p>
<p>The guard at the jail, seeing the concourse approaching,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page257' name='book2_page257'></a>257</span>
threw down his <i>machete</i> and fled. Rosendo&rsquo;s eyes were big
with speculation, though his heart beat apprehensively. The
people jammed into the small hut until it swayed and threatened
to collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to the lock&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! the guard has it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! bring a <i>barra</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan quickly produced a long iron bar, and with a few
lusty efforts sprung the stocks. A dozen hands lifted the
cramped Rosendo out and stood him upon his feet. Carmen
squirmed through the crowd and threw herself into his arms.</p>
<p>Then, with shouts and gesticulations, a triumphal procession
quickly formed, and the bewildered and limping Rosendo
was escorted down the main street of the town and across the
<i>plaza</i> to his home. At the door of the house Jos&egrave; turned and,
holding up a hand, bade the people quietly disperse and leave
the liberated man to enjoy undisturbed the sacred reunion with
his family. With a parting shout, the people melted quickly
away, and quiet soon reigned again over the ancient town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, pausing before his door to
clasp anew the priest&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;you have not told me what has
caused this. Was it the little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short. Glancing in at the door, his eyes had
fallen upon Ana. To Jos&egrave;, hours seemed suddenly compressed
into that tense moment.</p>
<p>Slowly Rosendo entered the house and advanced to the
shrinking woman. Terror spread over her face, and she
clutched her throat as the big man stalked toward her. Then,
like a flash, Carmen darted in front of her and faced Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Anita, padre dear,&rdquo; she said, looking up into his set
face, and clasping his hand in both of hers. &ldquo;She has come
home again. Aren&rsquo;t we glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo seemed not to see the child. His voice came cold
and harsh. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, outcast, is your lover with you, that I may
strangle him, too?&rdquo; He choked and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; cried Carmen, putting both her hands against
him. &ldquo;See! Those bad thoughts nearly strangled you! Don&rsquo;t
let them get in! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, girl!&rdquo; snarled the angry man, still addressing the
cowering woman. &ldquo;Did you tire of him, that you now sneak
home? Or&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; as Ana rose and stood before him,
&ldquo;you come here that your illegal brat may be born! Not under
my roof! <i>Santa Maria!</i> Never! Take it back to him! Take
it back, I say!&rdquo; he shouted, raising his clenched fist as if to
strike her.</p>
<p>Carmen turned swiftly and threw herself upon the woman.
Looking over her shoulder, she addressed the raging man:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page258' name='book2_page258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo! this is not your house! It is God&rsquo;s! He
only lets you have it, because He is good to you! Shame on
you, for daring to drive Anita away&ndash;&ndash;your own little girl!&rdquo;
Her voice rose shrill, and her words cut deep into the old man&rsquo;s
embittered heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, padre Rosendo!&rdquo; quickly flowed the scorching
words. &ldquo;If God were like you He would drive you from
the house, too! Are you so much better than the good Jesus
that you can drive away a woman who sins? Shame on you,
padre! Are you better than the good father who was so glad
to see his prodigal son? If God were to punish you for your
sins, would He even let you live? Did He not set you free this
very morning? And do you now thank Him by driving your
little girl from her own home? Do you know that it was Anita
who made you free, and who brought me here? God used her
to do that. And is this the way you thank Him? Then you
will lose us both, for we will not stay with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; stepped up and took Rosendo&rsquo;s arm. Carmen turned
about and continued her scoriation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo, if the good, pure God was willing to use
Anita to save me from Padre Diego and bring me back to you,
are you so wicked and so ungrateful that you throw His love
back in His face? Shame on you, padre! Shame! Shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; cried Rosendo, tears bursting from his eyes.
&ldquo;She has fouled my name&ndash;&ndash;it was a good name, though my
parents were slaves&ndash;&ndash;it was a good name&ndash;&ndash;and she blackened
it&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Rosendo, there are only two names that have never
been blackened! Your human name is nothing&ndash;&ndash;it is zero&ndash;&ndash;it
counts for foolishness with God! You yourself are making
your name blacker now than Anita ever did! She repents, and
comes to her father; and he is so much more wicked than she
that he drives her out!&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, Carmen, child!&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Come, Rosendo;
go into the parish house! Carmen, go with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen hesitated. Then a smile lighted up her face, and
she reached up and took Rosendo&rsquo;s hand. Together they
passed silently out and into the priest&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Ana sank to the floor, where she buried her face in her
hands and wept violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Ana,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, tenderly stroking the unhappy
woman&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;Wait. They will soon return. And you shall
remain here, where you belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour passed. Then Jos&egrave;, wondering, went quietly
to the door of his house and looked in. Rosendo sat at the
table, with Carmen on his knees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page259' name='book2_page259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And, padre,&rdquo; the child was saying, &ldquo;the good Jesus told
the woman not to sin any more; and she went away happy.
Padre, God has told Anita not to sin any more&ndash;&ndash;and she has
come to us to be happy. We are going to make her so, aren&rsquo;t
we? Padre Diego couldn&rsquo;t hurt me, you know, for God
wouldn&rsquo;t let him. And he hasn&rsquo;t hurt Anita&ndash;&ndash;God wouldn&rsquo;t
let him keep her&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t let her stay with him. Don&rsquo;t you
see, padre? And we have got to be like Him&ndash;&ndash;we <i>are</i> like Him,
really. But now we have got to show it, to prove it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s head was bent over the girl. Neither of them
saw Jos&egrave;. The child went on with increased animation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, padre dear, God sends us Anita&rsquo;s little baby for us to
love and protect. Oh, padre, if the little one is a boy, can&rsquo;t we
call it Jos&egrave;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; heard the old man murmur brokenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;padre, if it is a girl&ndash;&ndash;what shall we call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s arm tightened about her. &ldquo;We&ndash;&ndash;we will call it&ndash;&ndash;Carmencita,&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>The girl clapped her hands. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, padre, that
God sends us Anita&rsquo;s baby so that Padre Diego shall not have
it? And now let&rsquo;s go and tell her so, right away!&rdquo; she cried,
jumping down.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; slipped quickly back and stood beside the woman when
Carmen and Rosendo entered the room. The old man went
directly to his daughter, and, taking her in his brawny arms,
raised her from the floor and strained her to his breast. Tears
streamed down his swart cheeks, and the words he would utter
choked and hung in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; whispered the delighted child, &ldquo;shall I tell her
our names for the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned and stole softly from the room. Divine Love
was there, and its dazzling effulgence blinded him. In the
quiet of his own chamber he sought to understand the
marvelous goodness of God to them that serve Him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 27</h2>
</div>
<p>The reversal of a life-current is not always effected suddenly,
nor amid the din of stirring events, nor yet in an
environment that we ourselves might choose as an appropriate
setting. It comes in the fullness of time, and amid such
scenes as the human mind which undergoes the transformation
may see externalized within its own consciousness by the
working of the as yet dimly perceived laws of thought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page260' name='book2_page260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>Perhaps some one, skilled in the discernment of mental
laws and their subtle, irresistible working, might have predicted
the fate which overtook the man Jos&egrave;, the fulsome details
of which are herein being recounted. Perhaps such a
one might say in retrospect that the culmination of years of
wrong thinking, of false beliefs closely cherished, of attachment
to fear, to doubt, and to wrong concepts of God, had been
externalized at length in eddying the man upon this far verge
of civilization, still clinging feebly to the tattered fragments of
a blasted life. But it would have been a skilled prognostician,
indeed, who could have foreseen the renewal of this wasted
life in that of the young girl, to whom during the past four
years Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n had been transferring his own unrealized
hopes and his vast learning, but without the dross of inherited
or attached beliefs, and without taint of his native
vacillation and indecision of mind.</p>
<p>For what he had been striving to fit her, he knew not. But
in a vaguely outlined way he knew that he was being used as
a tool to shape in some degree the mental development of this
strange girl. Nor, indeed, as the years passed, did she continue
to seem so strange to him. On the contrary, he now
thought it more marvelous by far that the world, after nineteen
centuries of Christianity, did not think and act more as
did this girl, whose religious instruction he knew to have been
garnered at the invisible hand of God. That she must some
day leave him, despite her present earnest protestations, he
felt to be inevitable. And the thought pierced his soul like a
lance. But he could not be certain that with maturity she
would wish to remain always in the primitive environment in
which she had been nurtured. Nor could he, even if she were
willing, immolate her upon the barb of his own selfishness.</p>
<p>As for himself, the years had but seemed to increase the
conviction that he could never leave the Church, despite his
anomalous position and despite his renewed life&ndash;&ndash;unless, indeed,
she herself cast him forth. Each tenderly hopeful letter
from his proud, doting mother only added to this conviction
by emphasizing the obstacles opposing such a course. Her
declining years were now spent among the mental pictures
which she hourly drew upon the canvas of her imagination,
pictures in which her beloved son, chastened and purified, had
at length come into the preferment which had always awaited
loyal scions of the house of Rinc&oacute;n. Hourly she saw the day
draw nearer when he should be restored to her yearning arms.
Each dawn threw its first rays upon his portrait, which hung
where her waking eyes might open upon it. Each night the
shadow cast by the candle which always burned beneath it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page261' name='book2_page261'></a>261</span>
seemed to her eager sight to crown that fair head with a
bishop&rsquo;s mitre&ndash;&ndash;a cardinal&rsquo;s hat&ndash;&ndash;aye, at times she even saw
the triple crown of the Vicar of Christ resting upon those raven
locks. Jos&egrave; knew this. If her own pen did not always correctly
delineate her towering hopes, his astute uncle did not fail
to fill in whatever hiatus remained. And the pressure of filial
devotion and pride of race at times completely smothered within
him the voice of Truth which Carmen continually sounded,
and made him resolve often that on the day when she should
leave him he would bury his head in the lap of Mother Church
and submit without further resistance to the sable veil of assumed
authority which he knew she would draw across his
mind. Convincing as were the proofs which had come to him
of the existence of a great demonstrable principle which the
Christ had sought to make a dull world recognize, nevertheless
he had as yet failed to rise permanently above the mesmerism
of human belief, which whispered into his straining ears that
he must not strive to progress beyond his understanding, lest,
in the attempt to gain too rapidly, he lose all. To sink into
the arms of Mother Church and await the orderly revelation of
Truth were less dangerous now than a precipitate severance
of all ties and a launching forth into strange seas with an
untried compass.</p>
<p>The arguments to which he listened were insidious. True,
they reasoned, he had seemed to see the working of mental
law in his own restoration to health when he had first come to
Simit&iacute;. He had seemed to see Rosendo likewise restored. But
these instances, after all, might have been casual. That Carmen
had had aught to do with them, no one could positively
affirm. True, he had seen her protected in certain unmistakable
ways. But&ndash;&ndash;others were likewise protected, even where
there had been no thought of an immanent, sheltering God.
True, the incident of the epidemic in Simit&iacute; two years before
had impressed upon him the serious consequences of fear,
and the blighting results of false belief. He had profited by
that lesson. But he could not hope suddenly to empty his
mentality of its content of human thought; nor did wisdom
advise the attempt. He had at first tried to rise too rapidly.
His frequent backsliding frightened and warned him.</p>
<p>Thus, while the days sped by, did the priest&rsquo;s thought ebb
and flow. As morn broke, and the gallant sun drove the cowardly
shadows of night across the hills, his own courage rose,
and he saw in Carmen the pure reflection of the Mind which
was in Christ Jesus. As night fell, and darkness slunk back
again and held the field, so returned the legion of fears and
doubts that battled for his soul. Back and forth in the arena
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page262' name='book2_page262'></a>262</span>
of his consciousness strove the combatants, while he rushed
irresolutely to and fro, now bearing the banner of the powers
of light, now waving aloft, though with sinking heart, the
black flag of the carnal host. For a while after his arrival in
Simit&iacute; he had seemed to rise rapidly into the consciousness
of good as all-in-all. But the strain which had been constantly
upon him had prevented the full recognition of all that Carmen
saw, and each rise was followed by a fall that left him for long
periods immersed in despair.</p>
<p>Following the return of Carmen and the ripple of excitement
which her abduction had spread over the wonted calm
of Simit&iacute;, the old town settled back again into its accustomed
lethargy, and Jos&egrave; and the girl resumed their interrupted
work. From Ana it was learned that Diego had not voiced
the command of Wenceslas in demanding the girl; and when
this became known the people rose in a body to her support.
Don Mario, though he threatened loudly, knew in his heart
he was beaten. He knew, likewise, that any further hostile
move on his part would result in a demand by the people for
his removal from office. He therefore retired sulking to the
seclusion of his <i>patio</i>, where he sat down patiently to await
the turn of events.</p>
<p>Rosendo, his great heart softened toward his erring daughter,
again rejoiced in the reunion of his broken family circle.
But his soul burned within him as, day after day, he saw Ana
move silently about like a sorrow incarnate. At times, when
perchance he would come upon her huddled in a corner and
weeping quietly, he would turn away, cursing deeply and
swearing fulsome vengeance upon the lecherous beast who
had wrought her ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he one day said to Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;I shall kill him&ndash;&ndash;I know
it. The girl&rsquo;s suffering is breaking my heart. He is like an evil
cloud hanging always over my family. I hate him! I hate
him, as the devil hates the light! And I shall kill him. Be
prepared.&rdquo; And Jos&egrave; offered no remonstrance, for the case
lay not in his hands.</p>
<p>Carmen again entered upon her interrupted studies with
ardent enthusiasm. And her first demand was that she be
allowed to plunge into a searching study of the Bible. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;it is a wonderful book! Why&ndash;&ndash;do the people
in the world know what a book this is? For if they did, they
would never be sick or unhappy again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew not how to answer her. And there was no need
that he should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; Her eyes were aflame with holy light. &ldquo;See!
Here it is&ndash;&ndash;the whole thing! &lsquo;Let the wicked forsake his way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page263' name='book2_page263'></a>263</span>
and the unrighteous man his <i>thoughts</i>.&rsquo; But&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t the people
know what that means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>chiquita</i>, and what does it mean?&rdquo; he asked indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;the unrighteous man is the man who thinks wrong
thoughts&ndash;&ndash;thoughts of power opposed to God&ndash;&ndash;thoughts of sin,
of sickness, of accidents, and all sorts of evil things&ndash;&ndash;beliefs
that these things are real, and that God made or caused them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, and you think the Bible speaks truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre! how can you ask that? Why, it says right here
that it is given by inspiration! That means that the men or
women who wrote it thought God&rsquo;s thoughts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That He wrote it, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but that those who wrote it were&ndash;&ndash;well, were cleaner
window-panes than other people&ndash;&ndash;that they were so clean that
the light shone through them better than it did through
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think now about Jesus?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as you once said, that he was the very cleanest
window-pane of all!&rdquo; she quickly replied.</p>
<p>From that hour the Bible was the girl&rsquo;s constant companion.
Daily she pored over it, delighted, enraptured. Jos&egrave; marveled
at her immediate spiritual grasp. Instead of the world&rsquo;s manner
of looking upon it as only a collection of beautiful promises
and admonitions, she saw within it the statement of a principle
that offered itself as a mighty tool with which to work
out humanity&rsquo;s every-day problems here and now. From the
first she began to make out little lists of collated scriptural
verses, so arranging them that she could read in them a complete
expression of an idea of God. These she would bring to
Jos&egrave; and, perching herself upon his lap, would expound them,
to her own great delight and the wonder of the man who
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Padre,&rdquo; she said, holding up one of these lists, &ldquo;it says
that &lsquo;in that day&rsquo; whatever we ask of him will be given to us.
Well, &lsquo;that day&rsquo; means when we have washed our window-panes
clean, and the light shines through so clear that we can
ask in His name. It means when we have stopped saying
that two and two are seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; Jos&egrave; interpolated, &ldquo;asking in his character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;for then we will be just like him. And
then whatever we ask &lsquo;believing&rsquo; will be given to us, for believing&rsquo;
will then be &lsquo;understanding,&rsquo; will it not? When we
know&ndash;&ndash;really <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;that we have things, why&ndash;&ndash;why, we have
them, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page264' name='book2_page264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>She did not wait for his reply, but went on enthusiastically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Padre, in order to be like him we have got to
&lsquo;seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;His
right-thinking. Well, Jesus said the kingdom of God was
within us. Of course it is, for it is all a question of right-thinking.
When we think right, then our right thoughts will
be&ndash;&ndash;what you said&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Externalized,&rdquo; he supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We will see them all around us, instead of seeing,
as we do now, a lot of jumbled-up thoughts of good and evil
which we call people and things. They will all be good then.
And then will be the time when &lsquo;God shall wipe away all tears.&rsquo;
It is, as you say in English, &lsquo;up to us&rsquo; to bring this about. It
is not for God to do it at all. Don&rsquo;t you see that He has already
done His part? He has made everything, and &lsquo;behold it was
very good.&rsquo; Well, He doesn&rsquo;t have to do it all over again, does
He? No. But we have got to wash our windows clean and let
in the light that comes from Him. That light comes from Him
all the time, just as the beams come from the sun, without
ever stopping. We never have to ask the sun to shine, do we?
And neither do we have to ask God to be good to us, nor tell
Him what we think He ought to do for us. We only have to
<i>know</i> that He is good, to us and to everything, all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, we must be truly baptised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what it means to be baptised, Padre&ndash;&ndash;just washing
our window-panes so clean that the light will come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that light, little one, is truth. It certainly is a new
way of looking at it, at least, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, it is the <i>only</i> way,&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, I would not say that you were mistaken, Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre, for we can prove it. And, look here,&rdquo; she continued,
referring to her list. &ldquo;If the kingdom of heaven is
within us, then everything that comes to us in life comes from
within, and not from without. And so, things never happen,
do they? Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he replied seriously, &ldquo;that from the mouths of babes
and sucklings comes infinite wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre dear, wisdom is God&rsquo;s light, and it comes
through any one who is clean. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference
how old or young that person is. Years mean nothing but&ndash;&ndash;but
zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say that, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, is God old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He is always the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are really like Him?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page265' name='book2_page265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The real &lsquo;we&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the unreal &lsquo;we&rsquo; is already zero. Didn&rsquo;t you yourself
say that the human, mortal man was a product of false thought,
thought that was the opposite of God&rsquo;s thought, and so no
thought at all? Didn&rsquo;t you say that such thought was illusion&ndash;&ndash;the
lie about God and what He has made? Then isn&rsquo;t the
human &lsquo;we&rsquo; zero?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;<i>chiquita</i>, it is often hard for me to see anything
but this sort of &lsquo;we,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned the man dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre!&rdquo; she entreated, &ldquo;why will you not try to look
at something else than the human man? Look at God&rsquo;s man,
the image of infinite mind. You have <i>got</i> to do it, you know,
some time. Jesus said so. He said that every man would have
to overcome. That means turning away from the thoughts
that are externalized as sin and sickness and evil, and looking
only at God&rsquo;s thoughts&ndash;&ndash;and, what is more, <i>sticking to them</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; dubiously, &ldquo;I suppose we must some time overcome
every belief in anything opposed to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but need that make you unhappy? It is just because
you still cling to the belief that there is other power than God
that you get so discouraged and mixed up. Can&rsquo;t you let go?
Try it! Why, I would try it even if a whole mountain fell on
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jos&egrave; could but clasp the earnest girl in his arms and
vow that he would try again as never before.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meantime, while Jos&egrave; and his little student-teacher were
delving into the inexhaustible treasury of the Word; while the
peaceful days came into their lives and went out again almost
unperceived, the priest Diego left the bed upon which he had
been stretched for many weeks, and hobbled painfully about
upon his scarcely mended ankle. While a prisoner upon his
couch his days had been filled with torture. Try as he might,
he could not beat down the vision which constantly rose before
him, that of the beautiful girl who had been all but his. He
cursed; he raved; he vowed the foulest vengeance. And then
he cried piteously, as he lay chained to his bed&ndash;&ndash;cried for something
that seemed to take human shape in her. He protested
that he loved her; that he adored her; that without her he was
but a blasted cedar. His nurses fled his bedside. His physician
stopped his ears. Only Don Antonio was found low enough in
thought to withstand the flow of foul language which issued
from the baffled Diego&rsquo;s thick lips while he moved about in
attendance upon the unhappy priest&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Then came from the acting-Bishop, Wenceslas, a mandate
commissioning Diego upon a religio-political mission to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page266' name='book2_page266'></a>266</span>
interior city of Medellin. The now recovered priest smiled
grimly when he read it. Then he summoned Ricardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare yourself, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for a work of the Lord.
I go into the interior. You accompany me as far as Badillo,
where we disembark for stinking Simit&iacute;. And, <i>amigo</i>, do you
secure a trustworthy companion. The work may be heavy.
Meantime, my blessing and absolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he sat down and despatched a long letter to Don
Mario.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 28</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; one morning shortly thereafter, as
the old man entered the parish house for a little chat,
&ldquo;a Decree has been issued recently by the Sacred Congregation
of the Holy Office whereby, instead of the cloth
scapulary which you are wearing, a medal may be substituted.
I have received several from Cartagena. Will you exchange
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, Padre&ndash;&ndash;but,&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;is the new one just
as&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, <i>amigo</i>. It carries the same indulgences. See,&rdquo;
exhibiting the medal. &ldquo;The Sacred Heart and the blessed Virgin.
But I have arranged it to wear about the neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo knelt reverently and crossed himself while Jos&egrave;
hung the new scapulary over his head. The old man beamed
his joy. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, rising, &ldquo;but I believe this
one will keep off more devils than that old cloth thing you made
for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rosendo!&rdquo; admonished Jos&egrave;, repressing a smile, &ldquo;did
I not bless that one before the altar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, Padre, and I beg a thousand pardons. It was the
blessing, wasn&rsquo;t it? Not the cloth. But this one,&rdquo; regarding
it reverently, &ldquo;this one&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, this one,&rdquo; put in Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;carries the blessing of
His Grace, acting-Bishop Wenceslas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a Bishop is always very holy, is he not, Padre?&rdquo;
queried Rosendo. &ldquo;It makes no difference who he is, for the
office makes him holy, is it not so, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, without doubt,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;, his thought reverting
to the little Maria and the babe which for four years he had
been supporting in distant Cartagena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre,&rdquo; remonstrated Rosendo, catching the insinuation,
&ldquo;we must not speak ill of the Bishop, lest he be a Saint to-morrow!
But, Padre,&rdquo; he went on, changing the topic, &ldquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page267' name='book2_page267'></a>267</span>
came to tell you that Don Luis has given me a contract to cut
wood for him on the island. A quantity, too. <i>Hombre!</i> I shall
earn much money by its terms. I set out to-morrow morning
before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; reflected. The man&rsquo;s words aroused within him a
faint suspicion. Don Luis and the Alcalde were boon companions.
Jos&egrave; wondered if in this commission he could see the
gloved hand of Don Mario. But he gave no hint of his thought
to Rosendo.</p>
<p>The next morning, long before sun-up, a mist lay thick over
the valley, so thick that Rosendo, as he made his way down to
the lake, scarce could distinguish the road ahead of him. The
dry season had passed, and the rains were now setting in. As
he hurried along, the old man mused dubiously on the contract
which Don Luis had made with him. To cut wood in the rainy
season!&ndash;&ndash;but, after all, that was no concern of his. And yet&ndash;&ndash;why
had Padre Jos&egrave; grown suddenly quiet when he learned of
the contract yesterday? His bare feet fell softly upon the
shales, and he proceeded more cautiously as he neared the
water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; he muttered, striving to penetrate the mist;
&ldquo;only a <i>loco</i> ventures out on the lake in such weather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached the boat, and placed in it the rope and axe
which he had brought. Then, still troubled in thought, he sat
down on the edge of the canoe and dropped into a puzzled
meditation.</p>
<p>Suddenly through the fog he heard a sound. Somebody was
approaching. A fisherman, perhaps. But fishermen do not go
out on the lake in dense fogs, he remembered. The tread
sounded nearer. He waited, speculating. Then through the
mist loomed the thick body of a man. Straining his eyes, Rosendo
recognized Padre Diego.</p>
<p>With a bound the old man was upon his feet. His thick
arm shot out like a catapult; and his great fist, meeting Diego
squarely upon the temple, felled him like an ox.</p>
<p>For a moment Rosendo stood over the prostrate priest, like
a lion above its prey. Then he reached into the canoe and drew
out the axe. Holding it aloft, he stood an instant poised above
the senseless man; then with a mighty swing he whirled about
and hurled it far out into the lake. He seemed suddenly bereft
of his senses. Incoherent muttering issued from his trembling
lips. He looked about in bewilderment. A thought seemed
to impress him. He took the rope from the boat and quickly
bound Diego hand and foot. This done, he picked up the unconscious
priest and tossed him into the canoe as if he had
been a billet of wood. Jumping in after him, he hastily pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page268' name='book2_page268'></a>268</span>
off from the shore and paddled vigorously in the direction of
the island. Why he was doing this he had not the faintest
idea.</p>
<p>It was all the work of a few seconds; yet when his reason
came again Rosendo found himself far out in the thick fog,
and his prisoner moaning softly as consciousness slowly returned.
The sense of direction which these sons of the jungle
possess is almost infallible, and despite the watery cloud which
enveloped him, the old man held his course undeviatingly toward
the distant isle, into the low, muddy shore of which his
boat at length forced its way under the impulse of his great
arms.</p>
<p>The island, a low patch a few acres in extent, lay far out
in the lake like a splotch of green paint on a plate of glass. Its
densely wooded surface, rising soft and oozy only a few feet
above the water, was destitute of human habitation, but afforded
a paradise for swarms of crawling and flying creatures,
which now scattered in alarm at the approach of these early
visitors coming so unexpectedly out of the heavy fog.</p>
<p>When the canoe grounded, Rosendo sprang out and pulled
it well up into the mud. Then he lifted the priest out and staggered
into the thick brush, where he threw his burden heavily
upon the ground. Leaving his prisoner for a moment, he
seized his <i>machete</i> and began to cut back into the brush. A
grunt of satisfaction came from his lips. Returning to the now
conscious Diego, he grasped the rope which bound him and
dragged him along the newly opened trail into a little clearing
which lay beyond. There he propped him up against a huge
cedar. As he did this, Diego&rsquo;s mouth opened wide and a piercing
scream issued. &ldquo;Ricardo&ndash;&ndash;help!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>The cry echoed dismally across the desolate island. In an
instant Rosendo was upon him, with his knife clutched in his
fist. &ldquo;Repeat that, <i>cayman</i>,&rdquo; he cried furiously, &ldquo;and this finds
your wicked heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The craven Diego shook with fear; but he fell silent before
the threat of the desperate man into whose hands he had so
unwittingly fallen.</p>
<p>Rosendo stepped back and stood before his captive, regarding
him uncertainly. Diego&rsquo;s quick intuition did not fail to
read the old man&rsquo;s perplexity; and his own hope revived accordingly.
It was a pretty trick, this of Rosendo&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;but, after
all, he would not dare too much. Diego gradually became easier
in mind. He even smiled unctuously at his captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, amigo</i>,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;is this your customary
reception to visitors in your village? <i>Caramba!</i> but what will
the good Bishop say when he learns that you have thus mistreated
his trusted agent?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page269' name='book2_page269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>Rosendo stood before him like a statue. His thought was
confused, and it moved slowly. In the cries of the disturbed
birds he seemed now to hear the warning voice of Carmen. In
the watery vapor that rolled over him he seemed to feel the
touch of her soft, restraining hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, compadre</i>,&rdquo; purred Diego, &ldquo;would it not be well for
you to loosen this bit of thread, that we may make our way
back to the village? <i>Caramba!</i> but it cuts sore&ndash;&ndash;and I am soft,
my friend, for I have been ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s wrath flared up anew. &ldquo;What made you ill,
<i>cayman</i>?&rdquo; he shouted, drawing nearer to the shrinking Diego
and shaking a great fist in his face. &ldquo;What made you ill, buzzard?
<i>Caramba!</i> I would that your illness had carried you
off and saved me the task of sending you down to purgatory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego became thoroughly alarmed again. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;<i>caro
amigo</i>, let us reason together! Ah, <i>compadre</i>&ndash;&ndash;loosen
but a little this rope which cuts into my tender skin as your
bitter words do into my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, vulture, but you will drown more quickly thus!&rdquo; retorted
Rosendo, his huge frame trembling with agitation.</p>
<p>Diego&rsquo;s heart stopped. Then he sought to collect himself.
He was in a desperate plight. But the man before him was an
ignorant <i>peon</i>. It was not the first time that he had set his
own wit against another&rsquo;s brute strength. The ever-present
memory of the girl became more vivid. It glowed before him.
What was it she had said? &ldquo;You see only your thoughts of
me&ndash;&ndash;and they are very bad!&rdquo; Was he seeing now only his
own bad thoughts? But she had said they were unreal. And
this episode&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre!</i> he would not be afraid. His thought
was vastly more powerful than that of a simple <i>peon</i>! He
smiled again at his fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; he resumed gently, &ldquo;if you had wished to
drown me, why did you bring me here? But&ndash;&ndash;ah, well, I have
long been prepared to go. I have been sadly misunderstood&ndash;&ndash;disbelieved&ndash;&ndash;persecuted!
Ah, friend Rosendo, if you could
know what I do&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, it is of no consequence now.
Come, then, good fellow, despatch me quickly! I have made
my peace with God.&rdquo; Diego ceased talking and began to murmur
prayers.</p>
<p>Rosendo stared at him in amazement. The wind was being
taken from his sails. Diego noted the effect, and resumed his
speech. His voice was low and soft, and at times great tears
rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo, friend, I wish to go. I weary of life. There is
no stain upon my soul. And yet, I grieve that you must tarnish
yours with my blood. But,&rdquo; his eyes brightening and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page270' name='book2_page270'></a>270</span>
tone becoming more animated, &ldquo;Rosendo, I will pray the blessed
Virgin for you. When I am with her in paradise I will ask her
to beg the gentle Saviour to forgive you. <i>Bien</i>, good friend, we
shall all be together in heaven some day.&rdquo; He started his
orisons again, and soon was praying like a locomotive: &ldquo;<i>Ora
pro nobis! Santa Maria, ora pro nobis!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and sighed gently. Rosendo stood stupidly before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;I must say this before I die&ndash;&ndash;I came to Simit&iacute; to
see you. I was approaching the boat to hold converse with
you. But, you struck me&ndash;&ndash;there, <i>qu&eacute; importa</i>! And yet&ndash;&ndash;it
was about the gentle Ana, your beautiful daughter&ndash;&ndash;But,
wait, Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;God above! hear me through&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo had started again toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good friend, hear me first, then kill me quickly, for I
much desire to go to my home above!&rdquo; Diego spoke rapidly.
The impression must be made upon Rosendo at once, or all was
lost. The wily priest knew the <i>peon</i> mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, good friend, you have misunderstood me. But I forgive
you. I&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;you will keep my secret, will you
not? Bien, I have left the Church. I am no longer a priest.
It was for good reasons that God took me from the priesthood
for other work in His field. <i>Bien</i>, the bonds of celibacy removed,
behold! my first thought is for my beautiful Ana. I
came to ask you for her hand. I would render legitimate her
unborn child. I would return to her the peace which she lost
when we became so deeply enamored of each other. Rosendo,
I have come to Simit&iacute; to lay my life before you&ndash;&ndash;to yield it to
the mother of my child&ndash;&ndash;to offer it in future service as a recompense
for the unhappiness which, the Virgin knows, I did not
willingly bring upon her, or you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s head was now in a whirl. His eyes protruded,
and his mouth was agape. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the little Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! friend,&rdquo; said Diego sadly, shaking his head, while he
quickly grasped the cue, &ldquo;I have ceased my endeavors to make
you believe that she is my child. <i>Caramba!</i> I can only leave
it to the blessed Virgin to restore her to me when we have
both passed the portals of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still claim to be her father? You&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caro amigo</i>,&rdquo; returned Diego gently, &ldquo;in these last moments
I see in her the beautiful image of her blessed mother, who was
taken from me long before I met and loved your Ana. But I
despair of enforcing my claim. I await now the reunion which
death alone can effect. And so, friend, be quick! But do not
make me suffer. Drown me not, I pray you, but rather open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page271' name='book2_page271'></a>271</span>
an artery and let me fall gently asleep here beneath this noble
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light came into Rosendo&rsquo;s troubled eyes. A cunning smile
lurked about his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien pues</i>, it shall be as you wish, vulture,&rdquo; he replied in
a tone which again struck terror to Diego&rsquo;s heart. He drew his
knife and approached the horrified priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; shrieked Diego, shrinking back against the
tree. &ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i> you do not intend&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, vampire?&rdquo; returned Rosendo, the sardonic smile
spreading across his grim features. &ldquo;Did you not ask it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre</i>! Back!&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! Back!&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;God
above! But would you go down to hell with murder on your
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, carrion! I kill the body. But you go down with a
load of murdered souls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;God!&ndash;&ndash;it means hell for eternity to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, dog-meat,&rdquo; calmly replied Rosendo. &ldquo;But hell
will be heaven to me as I sit forever and hourly remind you of
the suffering Ana and the beautiful Carmen, whom you tried
to ruin! Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; Diego saw that he had lost. Wild thoughts
flashed through his mind with lightning speed. Desperation
lent them wings. A last expedient came to him. He fixed his
beady eyes upon Rosendo and muttered: &ldquo;Coward! coward!
you bind a sick man and stick him like a pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo hesitated. Diego quickly followed up his slight
advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We give a deer, a tapir, a jaguar, a chance for its life. We
fear them not. But you&ndash;&ndash;coward, you are afraid of a sick man!
And a priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo could bear the taunt no longer. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;what would you?&rdquo; He leaped to the sitting man and at
a stroke severed his bonds. Diego got slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, spew of the vampire! you have now a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diego extended his empty hands, palms up. He smiled
significantly. Rosendo caught the insinuation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> take the knife! <i>Hombre!</i> but I will kill you
with my bare hands!&rdquo; He threw the long knife to Diego, who
stooped and picked it up.</p>
<p>Stepping quickly back, holding the weapon firmly clenched
before him, the priest slowly circled Rosendo, as if looking for
an opening. An evil smile played constantly over his heavy
face, and his little eyes glittered like diamonds. Rosendo stood
like a rock, his long arms hanging at his side.</p>
<p>Then, with a shrill, taunting laugh, Diego turned suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page272' name='book2_page272'></a>272</span>
and plunged into the newly-cut trail toward the lake. In an
instant he was lost in the fog.</p>
<p>For a moment Rosendo stood dumb with amazement. Then
he sprang after the priest. But it was too late. Diego had
reached the canoe, leaped quickly in, and pushed off. Rosendo
saw the mist swallow him. He was left a prisoner, without a
boat, and with two miles of shrouded water stretching between
him and the town!</p>
<p>A low moan burst from him. He had been tricked, outwitted;
and the evil genius which for years had menaced his
happiness was heading straight toward the town, where his
accomplice, Ricardo, awaited. What would they do, now that
he was out of the way? The thought seared his brain. Great
beads of water, distilled from his agony, burst through his
pores. The Juncal river lay off to the west, and at a much less
distance than Simit&iacute;. He might swim to it and secure a canoe
at the village. But&ndash;&ndash;the lake was alive with crocodiles!</p>
<p>Chagrin and apprehension overwhelmed him, and he burst
into a flood of bitter tears. He threw himself upon the ground,
and tossed and moaned in despair. The fog thickened. A
twilight darkness settled over the waters. Nature&ndash;&ndash;God himself&ndash;&ndash;seemed
to conspire with Diego.</p>
<p>Rosendo suddenly rose to his feet. He drew the new medal
scapulary around in front of him and kissed it, reverently crossing
himself. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen</i>,&rdquo; he prayed, &ldquo;help me&ndash;&ndash;it is for
the child!&rdquo; Then, taking between his teeth the knife which
Diego had dropped, he rushed into the water and struck out
for the distant village of Juncal.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Late that afternoon, while the tropical rain was descending
in torrents, Rosendo staggered into the parish house, where
Carmen and Jos&egrave; were absorbed in their work. &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; he
gasped, &ldquo;<i>Loado sea Dios!</i>&rdquo; as his eyes fell upon the girl. Then
he sank to the floor in utter exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo! what is it?&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, bending over him in apprehension,
while Carmen stood lost in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Diego&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; cried Rosendo, raising himself up on his
elbow. &ldquo;Has he been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre Diego!&rdquo; cried both Jos&egrave; and the girl in astonishment.
Instinctively Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arm went about the child. Rosendo
dragged himself to a chair and sank limply into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Padre, he will come. He is in Simit&iacute;. He is no
longer a priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the story came out, bit by bit. Jos&egrave; listened in horror.
Carmen&rsquo;s face was deeply serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, concluding his dramatic and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page273' name='book2_page273'></a>273</span>
disconnected recital, &ldquo;I plowed through the water&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba!</i>
I knew not at what moment I should feel the jaws of a cayman
seize upon me! But the Virgin had heard my prayer. I must
offer a candle this night. But I did not land at Juncal. It was
some half league farther west. <i>Bien</i>, I was then glad, for had
I appeared in the village, all would have said that I had murdered
Diego! And so I struck out along the trail that skirts
the lake, and followed it around until I came here. <i>Caramba</i>!
but see how my feet are cut! And the rain&ndash;&ndash;H<i>ombre</i>! it beat
me down&ndash;&ndash;I fell again and again! And then, the fear that I
was too late&ndash;&ndash;<i>Ah, Dios</i>! But she is safe&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! the Virgin
be praised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; anxiously, &ldquo;where can Diego&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here, <i>Caramba</i>! in Simit&iacute;! <i>Hombre</i>! but I shall set
out at once and search every house! And he shall do well if
he escape this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But dusk was falling; and the old man, his strength sapped,
listened not unwillingly to Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s better counsel. With the
coming of night the rain ceased, and the clouds rolled up and
slipped down behind the mountains, leaving the moon riding
in splendor across the infinite blue. Then Jos&egrave;, leaving Carmen
with Rosendo, walked to and fro through the streets of
the old town, listening and watching. He wandered down to
the lake. He climbed the hill where stood the second church.
He thought he caught the gleam of a light within the old edifice.
He crept nearer. There were men inside. Their voices
sounded ghostly to his straining ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, friend Ricardo, he set out before dawn, and is not
yet returned. I fear he has either abandoned us, or has walked
into our good Rosendo&rsquo;s jaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, bleating calf!&rdquo; cried the other petulantly.
&ldquo;It is more likely that he and Don Mario lie pickled in
rum under the palms of the Alcalde&rsquo;s <i>patio</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; waited to hear no more. He hurried down through the
main street and past the house of Don Mario. The door stood
open, and he could see the portly figure of the official outlined
against the back wall. It was evident that Diego was not there.
He returned in perplexity to his house and sat far into the
night, musing on the strange incident.</p>
<p>With the coming of the new day Rosendo appeared with
fresh suggestions. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is nothing to
do now but take the girl and flee to the Boque river and to the
<i>hacienda</i> of Don Nicol&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; related his experience of the previous night. Rosendo
whistled softly. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but this is a mystery!
And&ndash;&ndash;but here comes Juan.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page274' name='book2_page274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>The lad entered excitedly. &ldquo;Your canoe, Don Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;as
I started out on the lake to fish I saw it, far in the distance. I
brought it in. There was neither pole nor paddle in it. And
it was half full of water. It must have drifted all night. Did
it break away from its mooring, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo looked at Jos&egrave;. The latter replied quickly: &ldquo;That
is the most reasonable supposition, Juan. But Rosendo is very
grateful to you for securing it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the lad had gone, Rosendo sat with bowed head,
deeply perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pole and paddle, Padre, were left on the island. I
took them out when we landed. Diego pushed off without
them. He&ndash;&ndash;the boat&ndash;&ndash;it must have drifted long. But&ndash;&ndash;did he
land? Or&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and scratched his head. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said, looking
up suddenly with an expression of awe upon his face, &ldquo;do
you suppose&ndash;&ndash;do you think that the Virgin&ndash;&ndash;that she&ndash;&ndash;made
him fall from the canoe into the lake&ndash;&ndash;and that a <i>cayman</i> ate
him? <i>Ca-ram-ba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; did not vouchsafe a reply. But his heart leaped with
a great hope. Rosendo, wrapped in profound meditation, wandered
back to his house, his head bent, and his hands clasped
tightly behind his back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 29</h2>
</div>
<p>The rainy season dragged its reeking length through the
Simit&iacute; valley with fearful deliberation. Jos&egrave; thought that
he should never again see the sun. The lake steamed like
a cauldron. Great clouds of heavy vapor rolled incessantly upward
from the dripping jungle. The rain fell in cloud-bursts,
and the narrow streets of the old town ran like streams in a
freshet.</p>
<p>Then, one day, Rosendo abruptly announced, &ldquo;Padre, the
rains are breaking. The dry season is at hand. And the little
Carmen is fourteen years old to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave the priest a shock. He had been six years in Simit&iacute;!
And Carmen was no longer a child. Youth ripens quickly into
maturity in these tropic lands. The past year had sped like a
meteor across an evening sky, leaving a train of mingled light
and darkness. Of Diego&rsquo;s fate Jos&egrave; had learned nothing. Ricardo
and his companion had disappeared without causing even
a ripple of comment in Simit&iacute;. Don Mario remained quiet for
many weeks. But he often eyed Jos&egrave; and Rosendo malignantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page275' name='book2_page275'></a>275</span>
through the wooden grill at his window, and once he ordered
Fernando to stop Rosendo and ply him with many and pointed
questions. The old man was noncommittal, but he left a dark
suspicion, which was transmitted to the receptive mind of the
Alcalde. Acting-Bishop Wenceslas likewise was growing apprehensive
as the weeks went by, and both Jos&egrave; and Don Mario
were the recipients of letters of inquiry from him regarding the
whereabouts of the priest Diego. In the course of time came
other letters from Cartagena, and at length an order for a most
scrutinizing search to be made for the Bishop&rsquo;s confidential
agent.</p>
<p>It was of no avail. Rosendo&rsquo;s oft-repeated testimony revealed
nothing. The citizens of Simit&iacute; had not seen the man.
The Alcalde had nothing but his suspicions to offer. And these
might have fallen harmlessly upon the acting-Bishop&rsquo;s well
occupied thought, had it not been for the complicating influence
of certain other events. The first of these was the exhaustion
of the gold which Jos&egrave; and Carmen had discovered in the
old church. The other was the outbreak of the religio-political
revolution which Diego had predicted some six years before,
and which, in these latter days, Don Jorge, on his infrequent
journeys through Simit&iacute; had repeatedly announced as inevitable
and imminent. Their combined effect was such as to wrest
Carmen away from Jos&egrave;, and to set in a new direction the currents
of their lives.</p>
<p>For some time past Jos&egrave; had patched with growing anxiety
the shrinking of his gold supply, and had striven to lessen the
monthly contributions to Cartagena, meanwhile trying to
know that the need now looming daily larger before him would
be met. He had not voiced his apprehension to Carmen. But
he and Rosendo had discussed the situation long and earnestly,
and had at length resolved that the latter should again return
to Guamoc&oacute; to wash the Tigu&iacute; sands.</p>
<p>The old man sighed, but he uttered no protest. Yet each
day Jos&egrave; thought he grew quieter. And each day, too, he
seemed to become more tender of his sad-faced daughter, Ana,
and of the little grandson who had come into his humble home
only a few weeks before. He delayed his preparations for
specious reasons which Jos&egrave; knew cost him much effort to
invent. He clung to Carmen. He told his rosary often before
the church altar, and with tears in his eyes. And at night he
would come to Jos&egrave; and beg him to read from the Bible and
explain what he thought the Saviour had really meant to convey
to the humble fishermen of Galilee.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart was wrung. But at last the day arrived when
he had nothing to send to Cartagena beyond the mere pittance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page276' name='book2_page276'></a>276</span>
which the poor members of his little parish contributed. But
this he sent as usual. The next month he did the same. Then
came a letter from Wenceslas, requesting an explanation. And
then it was that Jos&egrave; realized that in his excess of zeal he had
fallen into his own trap. For, having established the custom of
remitting a certain amount to the Bishop each month, he must
not resent now the implication of dishonesty when the remittances
fell off, or ceased altogether. He took the letter to Rosendo.
&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre,&rdquo; said the latter slowly, &ldquo;the time has
come. I set out for Guamoc&oacute; at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the days that followed, Jos&egrave; could frame no satisfactory
reply to Wenceslas, and so the latter wrote to the Alcalde. Don
Mario eagerly seized the proffered opportunity to ingratiate
himself into ecclesiastical favor. Rosendo was again in the
hills, he wrote, and with supplies not purchased from him.
Nor had he been given even a hint of Rosendo&rsquo;s mission,
whether it be to search again for La Libertad, or not. There
could be no doubt, he explained in great detail, of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s connivance
with Rosendo, and of his unauthorized conduct in the
matter of educating the girl, Carmen, who, he made no doubt,
was the daughter of Padre Diego&ndash;&ndash;now, alas! probably cold in
death at the violent hands of the girl&rsquo;s foster-father, and with
the priest Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s full approbation. The letter cost the portly
Don Mario many a day of arduous labor; but it brought its
reward in another inquiry from Cartagena, and this time a request
for specific details regarding Carmen.</p>
<p>Don Mario bestrode the clouds. He dropped his customary
well-oiled manner, and carried his head with the air of a conqueror.
His thick lips became regnant, imperious. He treated
his compatriots with supercilious disdain. And to Jos&egrave; he
would scarce vouchsafe even a cold nod as they passed in the
street. Again he penned a long missive to Cartagena, in which
he dilated at wearisome length upon the extraordinary beauty of
the girl, as well as her unusual mental qualities. He urged immediate
action, and suggested that Carmen be sent to the convent
in Mompox.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Wenceslas mused long over the Alcalde&rsquo;s letters. Many
times he smiled as he read. Then he sent for a young clerical
agent of the See, who was starting on a mission to Bogot&aacute;, and
requested that he stop off a day at Badillo and go to Simit&iacute; to
report on conditions in that parish. Incidentally, also, to gather
what data he might as to the family of one Rosendo Ariza.</p>
<p>In due course of time the agent made his report. The parish
of Simit&iacute; stood in need of a new <i>Cura</i>, he said. And the girl&ndash;&ndash;he
found no words to describe or explain her. She must be seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page277' name='book2_page277'></a>277</span>
The Church had need of prompt action, however, to secure her.
To that end, he advised her immediate removal to Cartagena.</p>
<p>Again Wenceslas deliberated. Aside from the girl, to whom
he found his thought reverting oftener than he could wish in
that particular hour of stress, his interest in Simit&iacute; did not extend
beyond its possibilities as a further contributor to the
funds he was so greatly needing for the furtherance of his
complex political plans. As to the Alcalde&ndash;&ndash;here was a possibility
of another sort. That fellow might become useful. He
should be cultivated. And at the same time warned against
precipitate action, lest he scatter Rosendo&rsquo;s family into flight,
and the graceful bird now dwelling in the rude nest escape the
sharp talons awaiting her.</p>
<p>He called for his secretary. &ldquo;Send a message to Francisco,
our Legate, who is now in Bogot&aacute;. Bid him on his return journey
stop again at Simit&iacute;. We require a full report on the
character of the Alcalde of that town.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meantime, Jos&egrave; did not permit his mental torture to interfere
with Carmen&rsquo;s education. For six years now that had
progressed steadily. And the results? Wonderful, he thought&ndash;&ndash;and
yet not wholly attributable to his peculiar mode of tutelage.
For, after all, his work had been little more than the
holding of her mind unwarped, that her instinctive sense of
logic might reach those truthful conclusions which it was bound
to attain if guided safely past the tortuous shifts of human
speculation and undemonstrable theory. To his great joy, these
six years had confirmed a belief which he had held ever since
the troublous days of his youth, namely, that, as a recent writer
has said, &ldquo;adolescent understanding is along straight lines, and
leaps where the adult can only laboriously creep.&rdquo; There had
been no awful hold of early teaching to loosen and throw off;
there were no old landmarks in her mind to remove; no tenacious,
clinging effect of early associations to neutralize. And,
perhaps most important of all, the child had seemed to enter
the world utterly devoid of fear, and with a congenital faith,
amounting to absolute knowledge, in the immanence of an
omnipotent God of love. This, added to her eagerness and
mental receptivity, had made his task one of constant rejoicing
in the realization of his most extravagant dreams for her.</p>
<p>As a linguist, Carmen had become accomplished. She spoke
English fluently. And it was only a matter of practice to give
her a similar grasp of French, Italian, and German. As for
other instruction, such knowledge of the outside world as he
had deemed wise to give her in these six years had been seized
upon with avidity and as quickly assimilated. But he often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page278' name='book2_page278'></a>278</span>
speculated curiously&ndash;&ndash;sometimes dubiously&ndash;&ndash;upon the great
surprises in store for her should she ever leave her native
village. And yet, as often as such thought recurred to him he
would try to choke it back, to bar his mind against it, lest the
pull at his heartstrings snap them asunder.</p>
<p>Often as he watched her expanding so rapidly into womanhood
and exhibiting such graces of manner, such amiability of
disposition, such selfless regard for others, combined with a
physical beauty such as he thought he had never before gazed
upon, a great yearning would clutch his soul, and a lump would
rise in his throat. And when, as was so often the case, her
arms flew impulsively about his neck and she whispered words
of tender endearment in his ear, a fierce determination would
seize him, and he would clutch her to himself with such vehemence
as to make her gasp for breath. That she might marry
he knew to be a possibility. But the idea pierced his soul as
with a sword, and he thought that to see her in the arms of
another, even the man of her choice, must excite him to murder.
One day, shortly after her fourteenth birthday, she came to him
and, perching herself as was her wont upon his knees, and
twining her arms about his neck, said, with traces of embarrassment,
&ldquo;Padre dear, Juan&ndash;&ndash;he asked me to-day to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; caught his breath. His ears rang. She&ndash;&ndash;marry a peon
of Simit&iacute;! To be sure, Juan had often reminded him of the
request he had made for her hand long ago. But Jos&egrave; had not
considered the likelihood of the lad&rsquo;s taking his question directly
to her. And the girl&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you reply?&rdquo; he asked thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;I told him that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>chiquita</i>; you told him&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo; His voice trembled.</p>
<p>She flushed, still hesitating. He held her back from him and
looked squarely into her wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told him, <i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;well, Padre dear, I told him that&ndash;&ndash;that I might never
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sighed. &ldquo;And do you think, little girl, that you will
always hold to that resolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre, unless&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>chiquita</i>, unless&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you marry, too, Padre,&rdquo; she said, dropping her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I marry! I&ndash;&ndash;a priest! But&ndash;&ndash;what has that to do
with it, girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;oh, Padre dear&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you see? For then I would
marry&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She buried her face in his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said, dully wondering.</p>
<p>Her arms tightened about his neck. &ldquo;You,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page279' name='book2_page279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>It was the first expression of the kind that had ever come
from her lips. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart thumped violently. The Goddess of
Fortune had suddenly thrown her most precious jewel into his
lap. Joy welled up in flood tides from unknown depths within.
His eyes swam. Then&ndash;&ndash;he remembered. And thick night fell
upon his soul.</p>
<p>Minutes passed, and the two sat very quiet. Then Carmen
raised her head. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say anything.
I know you love me. And you will not always be a
priest&ndash;&ndash;not always,&rdquo; shaking her beautiful curls with suggestive
emphasis.</p>
<p>Why did she say that? He wondered vaguely. The people
called her an <i>hada</i>. He sometimes thought they had reason to.
And then he knew that she never moved except in response to
a beckoning hand that still, after all these years, remained invisible
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said in low response, &ldquo;I fear&ndash;&ndash;I fear that can
never be. And even if&ndash;&ndash;ah, <i>chiquita</i>, I am so much older than
you, little girl&ndash;&ndash;almost seventeen years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not want to marry me, even if you could, Padre?&rdquo;
she queried, looking wistfully into his eyes, while her own grew
moist.</p>
<p>He clutched her to him again. &ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; he cried wildly,
&ldquo;you little know&ndash;&ndash;you little know! But&ndash;&ndash;child, we must not
talk of these things! Wait&ndash;&ndash;wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre dear,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;just say that you <i>do</i> love
me that way&ndash;&ndash;just say it&ndash;&ndash;your little girl wants to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God above! She, pleading that he would say he loved her!
His head sank upon his breast. He silently prayed that his
tortured soul might burst and let his wasted life ebb into
oblivion while his pent-up misery poured out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; he cried with the despair of the lost. &ldquo;I love
you&ndash;&ndash;love you&ndash;&ndash;love you! Nay, child, I adore you! God!
That I might hold you thus forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached up quickly and kissed him. &ldquo;Some day, Padre
dear,&rdquo; she murmured softly, &ldquo;you will stop thinking that two
and two are seven. Then everything good will come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank back in his arms and nestled close to him, as if she
longed to enter his empty heart and fill the great void with her
measureless love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;your little girl will wait
for you&ndash;&ndash;yes, she will wait.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was some days later that Rosendo, after returning almost
empty handed from the hills, came to Jos&egrave; and said, &ldquo;Padre,
I have sold my <i>hacienda</i> to Don Luis. I need the money to purchase
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page280' name='book2_page280'></a>280</span>
supplies and to get the papers through for some denouncements
which I have made in Guamoc&oacute;. I knew that Don Mario
would put through no papers for me, and so I have asked
L&aacute;zaro to make the transaction and to deliver the titles to me
when the final papers arrive. I have a blank here to be filled
out with the name and description of a mineral property. I&ndash;&ndash;what
would be a good name for a mine, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask that, Rosendo?&rdquo; queried Jos&egrave; in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Padre, I want a foreign name&ndash;&ndash;one not known,
here. Give me an American one. Think hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; reflected. &ldquo;There is a city, a great city, that I have
often heard about, up in the States,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>He took up the little atlas which he had received long since
with other books from abroad. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is called
Chicago. Call your property the Chicago mine, Rosendo. It is
a name unknown down here, and there can no confusion arise
because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; Rosendo muttered, trying to twist his tongue
around the word, &ldquo;it is certain that no one else will use that
name in Guamoc&oacute;! But that makes my title still more secure,
no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, when the full significance of the
old man&rsquo;s announcement had finally penetrated, &ldquo;you have sold
your <i>finca</i>! And to acquire title to property that you can never
sell or work! Why, man! do you realize what you have done?
You are impoverished! What will you do now? And what
about Carmen? for we have nothing. And the sword that hangs
above us may fall any day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, Padre, it is for her sake that I have done it. Say no
more. It will work out in some way. I go back to-morrow.
But, if the titles should come from Cartagena during my
absence&ndash;&ndash;and, Padre, if anything should happen to me&ndash;&ndash;for the
love of the Virgin do not let them out of your hands! They
are for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Rosendo departed not on the morrow. He remained to
mingle his tears with those of the sorrowing Ana. For the
woman, whose heart had been lighter since the arrival of her
babe, had come to the priest that day to have the child
christened. And so, before the sun might fill the <i>plaza</i> with
its ardent midday heat, Rosendo and his family repaired to the
church. There before the altar Jos&egrave; baptised the little one and
gave it his own name, thus triumphantly ushering the pagan
babe into the Christian Catholic world. The child cried at the
touch of the baptismal water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; commented Rosendo, &ldquo;the devil has gone out of him,
driven out by the holy water.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page281' name='book2_page281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>But, as Jos&egrave; leaned over the babe and looked into its dark
eyes, his hand stopped, and his heart stood still. He raised his
head and bent a look of inquiry upon the mother. She returned
the look with one that mutely voiced a stifled fear and confirmed
his own. &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;What is it?
Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a candle from the altar and passed it before the
child&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre! He sees! <i>Santa Virgen!</i> Do not tell me&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios
m&iacute;o</i>!&rdquo; The mother&rsquo;s voice rose to a wail, as she snatched her
babe away.</p>
<p>A loud exclamation escaped Rosendo. Do&ntilde;a Maria stood
mute; but Jos&egrave; as he looked at her divined her thought and read
therein a full knowledge of the awful fact that she had never
voiced to the heart-broken mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; cried the perplexed Rosendo. &ldquo;Maria!&rdquo; turning
in appeal to his wife. &ldquo;Speak, some one! <i>Santa Virgen</i>, speak!
Ana, what ails the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned his head aside. Carmen crowded close to the
weeping Ana. Do&ntilde;a Maria took Rosendo&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The babe, Rosendo,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;was born&ndash;&ndash;blind.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 30</h2>
</div>
<p>The &ldquo;revolutionist&rdquo; of Latin America is generally only the
disgruntled politician. His revolution is seldom more
than a violent squabble among greedy spoilsmen for
control of the loose-jointed administration. But the great
Mosquera Revolution which burst into flame in New Granada
in 1861 was fed with fuel of a different nature. It demonstrated,
if demonstration were necessary, that the Treaty of Westphalia
did not write <i>finis</i> to the history of bloodshed in the name of
Christ; that it had but banked the fires of religious animosity,
until the furnace should be transferred from the Old World to
the New, where the breath of liberty would again fan them into
vigorous activity.</p>
<p>The Mosquera War tore asunder Church and State; but left
unhappy Colombia prone and bleeding. It externalized a
mighty protest of enlightenment against Rome&rsquo;s dictates in
temporal affairs. And, as has before happened when that
irresistible potentiality, the people, has been stirred into action,
the Church was disestablished, its property confiscated, and its
meddling, parasitical clergy disenfranchised.</p>
<p>But then, too, as almost invariably occurs when the masses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page282' name='book2_page282'></a>282</span>
find that they have parted with cherished prejudices and effete
customs, and have adopted ideas so radical as to lift them a
degree higher in the scale of progress, they wavered. The
Church was being humiliated. Their religion was under
contempt. The holy sacrament of marriage was debased to a
civil ceremony. Education was endangered by taking it out of
the hands of the pious clergy. Texts unauthorized by Holy
Church were being adopted. Where would this radical modernism
end? The alarm spread, fanned by the watchful agents
of Rome. Revolt after revolt occurred. And twenty years of
incessant internecine warfare followed.</p>
<p>Fear and prejudice triumphed. A new Constitution was
framed. And when it was seen that Roman Catholicism was
therein again declared to be the national religion of the
Republic of Colombia; when it was noted that the clergy,
obedient to a foreign master, were to be readmitted to participation
in government affairs; when it was understood that a
national press-censorship was to be established, dominated by
Holy Church; and when, in view of this, the great religio-political
opponent was seen laying down her weapons and
extending her arms in dubious benediction over the exhausted
people, the masses yielded&ndash;&ndash;and there was great rejoicing on
the banks of the Tiber over the prodigal&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>When Wenceslas Ortiz was placed in temporary control of
the See of Cartagena he shrewdly urged the Church party to
make at least a pretense of disbanding as a political organization.
The provinces of Cundinamarca and Panam&aacute; were again
in a state of ferment. Congress, sitting in Bogot&aacute;, had before it
for consideration a measure vesting in the President the power
to interfere in certain states or provinces whenever, in his
opinion, the conservation of public order necessitated such
action. That this measure would be passed, Wenceslas could
not be sure. But that, once adopted, it would precipitate the
unhappy country again into a sanguinary war, he thought he
knew to a certainty. He had faced this same question six
years before, when a similar measure was before Congress.
But then, with a strong Church party, and believing the passage
of the law to be certain, he had yielded to the counsel of
hot-headed leaders in Cartagena, and approved the inauguration
of hostilities.</p>
<p>The result had been a <i>fiasco</i>. Congress dropped the measure
like a hot plate. The demands of the &ldquo;revolutionists&rdquo; were
quickly met by the federal government. The <i>causae belli</i>
evaporated. And Wenceslas retired in chagrin to the solitude
of his study, to bite his nails and wonder dubiously if his party
were strong enough to insure his appointment to the See of
Cartagena in the event of the then aged occupant&rsquo;s demise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page283' name='book2_page283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>It was this hasty judgment of Wenceslas and his political
associates which had delayed further consideration of the
objectionable measure for six years. But the interim had seen
his party enormously strengthened, himself in control of the
See, and his preparations completed for turning the revolt,
whenever it should come, to his own great advantage. He had
succeeded in holding the Church party aloof from actual participation
in politics during the present crisis. And he was now
keeping it in constant readiness to throw its tremendous influence
to whichever side should offer the greatest inducements.</p>
<p>Time passed. The measure dragged. Congress dallied; and
then prepared to adjourn. Wenceslas received a code message
from his agent in Bogot&aacute; that the measure would be laid on
the table. At the same time came a sharp prod from New
York. The funds had been provided to finance the impending
revolution. The concessions to be granted were satisfactory.
Why the delay? Had the Church party exaggerated its influence
upon Congress?</p>
<p>Wenceslas stormed aloud. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen!</i>&rdquo; he muttered,
as he paced angrily back and forth in his study. &ldquo;A curse upon
Congress! A curse&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped still. In the midst of his imprecations an idea
occurred to him. He went to his <i>escritorio</i> and drew out the
Legate&rsquo;s recent report. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;that pig-headed
Alcalde. And the good little Jos&egrave;. They may serve. <i>Bien</i>,
we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he summoned his secretary and dictated telegrams to
Bogot&aacute; and New York, and a long letter to the Alcalde of
Simit&iacute;. These finished, he called a young acolyte in waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a message to the Governor,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Say to
His Excellency that I shall, call upon him at three this afternoon,
to discuss matters of gravest import.&rdquo; Dismissing his
secretary, he leaned back in his chair and dropped into a
profound revery.</p>
<p>Shortly before the hour which he had set for conference
with the Departmental Governor, Wenceslas rose and went to
his <i>escritorio</i>, from which he took a paper-bound book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he commented aloud. &ldquo;&lsquo;Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest.&rsquo; <i>Bien</i>, I was correct in my surmise that I
should some day have use for this little volume. Poor, misguided
Rinc&oacute;n! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, I think it will do&ndash;&ndash;I think it will
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile played over his handsome, imperious face. Then
he snapped the book shut and took up his hat. At the door
he hesitated a moment, with his hand on the knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Alcalde were not such a fool, it would be impossible,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page284' name='book2_page284'></a>284</span>
he mused. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the combination&ndash;&ndash;the isolation of Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;the
imbecility of Don Mario&ndash;&ndash;the predicament of our little
Jos&egrave;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre</i>! it is a rare situation, and it will work. It <i>must</i>
work&ndash;&ndash;<i>cielo</i>! With the pig-headed Alcalde seizing government
arms to suppress the Church party as represented by the
foolish Jos&egrave;, and with the President sending federal troops to
quell the disturbance, the anticlericals will rise in a body
throughout the country. Then Congress will hastily pass the
measure to support the President, the Church party will swing
into line with the Government&ndash;&ndash;and the revolution will be on.
Simit&iacute; provides the setting and the fuel; I, the torch. I will
cable again to Ames when I leave the Governor.&rdquo; He swung
the door open and went briskly out.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Padre, I am crushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Rosendo who spoke. He and Jos&egrave; were sitting out
in the gathering dusk before the parish house on the evening
of the day that Ana&rsquo;s babe had been christened. The old man&rsquo;s
head was sunk upon his breast, and he rocked back and forth
groaning aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be brave, Rosendo,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave; tenderly. &ldquo;We
have gone through much, you and I, since I came to Simit&iacute;.
But&ndash;&ndash;we have believed it to be in a good cause. Shall we
surrender now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, after it all, to have her babe come into the
world blind! God above! The poor child&ndash;&ndash;the poor child!
Padre, it is the last thing that I can endure. My ambition is
gone. I cannot return now to Guamoc&oacute;. Let come what
may, I am done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, drawing his chair closer to the old
man, and laying a hand on his, &ldquo;we have fought long and hard.
But, if I mistake not, the greatest struggle is yet to come. The
greatest demand upon your strength and mine is still to be
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo raised his head. &ldquo;What mean you, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; spoke low and earnestly. &ldquo;This: Juan returned from
Bodega Central this evening. He reports that several large
boxes are there, consigned to Don Mario, and bearing the
government stamp. He found one of them slightly broken, and
he peered within. What think you it contained? Rifles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo stared at the priest dumbly. Jos&egrave; went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not intend to tell you this until morning. But it is
right that you should hear it now, that your courage may rise
in the face of danger. What think you? The federal government
is sending arms to Simit&iacute; to establish a base here at the
outlet of the Guamoc&oacute; region, and well hidden from the Magdalena
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page285' name='book2_page285'></a>285</span>
river. This town is to become a military depot, unless
I mistake the signs. And danger no longer threatens, but is at
our door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ca-ram-ba</i>!&rdquo; Rosendo rose slowly and drew himself up to
his full height. &ldquo;War!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no question about it, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;
gravely. &ldquo;And I have no reason to doubt the truth of Diego&rsquo;s
prophecy, that this time it will be one to be reckoned with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>! And Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her into the hills, Rosendo. Start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s thought was dwelling on his last talk with the girl.
Again he felt her soft arms about his neck, and her warm
breath against his cheek. He felt her kiss, and heard again her
words, the sweetest, he thought, that had ever echoed in
mortal ears. And then he thought of his mother, of his office,
of the thousand obstacles that loomed huge and insurmountable
between him and Carmen. He passed a hand across his brow
and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain here, Rosendo. I am weary, unutterably weary.
I welcome, not only the opportunity for service which this
war may bring, but likewise the hope of&ndash;&ndash;death. If I could
but know that she were safe&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! Think you she would leave you here, Padre?
No!&rdquo; Did Rosendo&rsquo;s words convey aught to the priest that he
did not already know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Rosendo, I shall not go,&rdquo; he returned bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then neither do we, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, sitting again.
&ldquo;The child, Carmen&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;Padre, she loves you with a love
that is not of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Morning found the old man&rsquo;s conviction still unshaken.
Jos&egrave; sought the quiet of his cottage to reflect. But his meditations
were interrupted by Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she began, sparkling like a mountain rill in the
sunlight as she seated herself before him. &ldquo;Pepito&ndash;&ndash;Anita&rsquo;s
babe&ndash;&ndash;he is not blind, you know.&rdquo; Her head bobbed vigorously,
as was her wont when she sought to give emphasis to her
dramatic statements.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; smiled, and resigned himself to the inevitable. He
had been expecting this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre, have you been thankful that he isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t what, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind. You know, Padre Diego thought he couldn&rsquo;t see
the reality. He looked always at his bad thoughts. And so
the not seeing, and the seeing of only bad things, were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page286' name='book2_page286'></a>286</span>
both&ndash;&ndash;externalized, and the babe came to us without sight. That is,
without what the human mind calls sight. And now,&rdquo; she went
on excitedly, &ldquo;you and I have just <i>got</i> to know that it isn&rsquo;t so!
The babe sees. God&rsquo;s children all see. And I have thanked Him
all morning that this is so, and that you and I see it. Don&rsquo;t
we, Padre dear? Yes, we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;I suppose so,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; abstractedly, his thought
still occupied with the danger that hung over the little town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose so! You <i>know</i> so, Padre! There isn&rsquo;t any &lsquo;suppose&rsquo;
about it! Now look: what makes sight? The eye? No.
The eye is made <i>by</i> the sight. The human mind just gets it
twisted about. It thinks that sight depends upon the optic
nerve, and upon the fleshly eye. But it isn&rsquo;t so. It is the sight
that externalizes the &lsquo;meaty&rsquo; eye. You see, the sight is within,
not without. It is mental. God is all-seeing; and so, sight is
eternal. Don&rsquo;t you see? Of course you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; did not reply. Yes, he did see. But what he saw was
the beautiful, animated girl before him. And the thought that
he must some day be separated from her was eating his heart
like a canker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; went on the girl, without waiting for his
reply, &ldquo;if a mortal&rsquo;s mental concept of sight is poor, why, he
will manifest poor eyes. If the thought-concept were right,
the manifestation would be right. Wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; suddenly returned to the subject under discussion.
&ldquo;By that I suppose you mean, <i>chiquita</i>, that the babe&rsquo;s thought,
or concept, of sight was all wrong, and so he came into the
world blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Padre,&rdquo; she quickly replied. &ldquo;The babe had
nothing to do with it, except to seem to manifest the wrong
thoughts of its father, or mother, or both. Or perhaps it manifests
just simply bad thoughts, without the bad thoughts belonging
to anybody. For, you know, we none of us really <i>have</i>
such thoughts. And such thoughts don&rsquo;t really exist. They
are just a part of the one big lie about God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the babe sees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely; the real babe is a child of God, and sees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the human babe doesn&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;what you call the human babe is only
your mental concept of the babe. And you see that mental
concept as a blind one. Now <i>un-see</i> it. Look at it in the right
way. See only God&rsquo;s child, with perfect sight. And, Padre,
after a while <i>you will see that babe seeing things, just as we do</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; she exclaimed, as he sat looking
fixedly at her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that if you have the right thought
about the babe, and hold to it, and put out every thought that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page287' name='book2_page287'></a>287</span>
says it is blind, why, your right thought will be externalized in
a mental concept of a babe that sees? Don&rsquo;t you know that
that is exactly what Jesus did? He didn&rsquo;t affect the real man
at all. But he did change the mental concepts which we call
human beings. And we can do the same, if we only know it,
and follow him, and spiritualize our thought, as he did, by
putting out and keeping out every thought that we know does
not come from God, and that is, therefore, only a part of the
lie about Him. Here is a case where we have got to quit thinking
that two and two are seven. And I have done it. It is
God&rsquo;s business to make our concepts right. And He has done
so&ndash;&ndash;long since. And we will see these, right concepts if we
will put out the wrong ones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he queried lamely, wholly at a loss for any other
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre, I am not a bit afraid. I don&rsquo;t see a blind babe
at all, because there just can&rsquo;t be any. And neither do you.
The babe sees because God sees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, you don&rsquo;t intend to allow yourself to be
deceived by appearances?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it, Padre!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Blindness is only
an appearance. But it doesn&rsquo;t appear to God, It appears only
to the human mind&ndash;&ndash;which isn&rsquo;t any mind at all! And the appearance
can be made to disappear, if we know the truth and
stick to it. For any appearance of a human body is a mental
concept, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thing of thought, then?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a thing of <i>wrong</i> thought. But all wrong thought is
subject to God&rsquo;s right thought. We&rsquo;ve proved that, haven&rsquo;t we,
lots of times? Well, this wrong thought about a babe that is
blind can be changed&ndash;&ndash;made to disappear&ndash;&ndash;just as any lie can
be made to disappear when we know the truth. And so you and
I are not going to be afraid, are we? I told Anita this morning
not to worry, but to just <i>know</i> all the time that her babe did see,
no matter what the appearance was. And she smiled at me,
Padre, she smiled. And I know that she trusts, and is going
to work with you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Work with her! Heavens! had he done aught of late but
work against her by his constant harboring of fears, of doubts,
and his distrust of spiritual power?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;I want you to promise me that every
day you will thank God that the babe really sees. And that you
will turn right on every thought of blindness and know that
it is a part of the lie about God, and put it right out of your
mind. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;child&ndash;&ndash;if my mind tells me that the babe is blind,
how can I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page288' name='book2_page288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what your mind tells you about the babe!
You are to listen to what God tells you, not your human mind!
Does God tell you that the babe is blind? Does He?&rdquo; she repeated,
as the man hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, <i>chiquita</i>, He&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Padre,&rdquo; she interrupted again, drawing closer to
him. &ldquo;Is God good, or bad, or both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is good, <i>chiquita</i>, all good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infinite good, then, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have long since proved by actual reasoning and
demonstration that He is mind, and so infinite mind, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be conceded, Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, an infinite mind has all power. And an infinite, all-powerful
mind that is all good could not possibly create anything
bad, or sick, or discordant&ndash;&ndash;now could He?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly impossible, little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible says so. Our reasoning tells us so. But&ndash;&ndash;the
five physical senses tell us differently. Don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, we know that the five physical senses <i>do not tell
us truth</i>! We know that when the human mind thinks it is
receiving reports about things through the five physical senses
it is doing nothing more than looking at its own thoughts.
Now isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly seems so, little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thoughts of an infinite and good mind must be like
that mind, all good, no? Well, then, thoughts of discord, disease,
blindness, and death&ndash;&ndash;do they come from the infinite,
good mind? No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>chiquita m&iacute;a</i>, that is just the sticking point. I can
see all the rest. But the mighty question is, where <i>do</i> those
thoughts come from? I am quite as ready as you to admit
that discord, sin, evil, death, and all the whole list of human
ills and woes come from these bad thoughts held in the human
mind and so externalized. I believe that the human man really
sees, feels, hears, smells, and tastes these thoughts&ndash;&ndash;that the
functioning of the physical senses is wholly mental&ndash;&ndash;takes
place in mind, in thought only. That is, that the human mind
thinks it sees, feels, hears; but that the whole process is mental,
and that it is but regarding its thoughts, instead of actually
regarding and cognizing objects outside of itself. Do you follow
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she replied with animation. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just
what I am trying to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;and here is the great obstacle&ndash;&ndash;we differentiate between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page289' name='book2_page289'></a>289</span>
good and bad thoughts. We agree that a fountain can
not send forth sweet and bitter waters at the same time. And
so, good and bad thoughts do not come from the infinite mind
that we call God. But where do the others originate? Answer
that, <i>chiquita</i>, and my problems will all be solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in perplexity for some time. It seemed to
her that she never would understand him. But, with a little
sigh of resignation, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you answered that question yourself, long ago.
You worked it all out three or four years ago. But&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&rsquo;t stuck to it. You let the false testimony of the physical
senses mesmerize you again. Instead of sticking to the thoughts
that you knew to be good, and holding to them, in spite of the
pelting you got from the others, you have looked first at the
good, and then at the bad, and then believed them all to be
real, and all to be powerful. And so you got miserably mixed
up. And the result is that you don&rsquo;t know where you stand.
Do you? Or, you think you don&rsquo;t; for that thought, too, is a
bad one, and has no power at all, excepting the power that you
seem willing&ndash;&ndash;and glad&ndash;&ndash;to give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced under the poignant rebuke. He knew in his
heart that she was right. He had not clung to the good, despite
the roars of Satan. He had not &ldquo;resisted unto blood.&rdquo;
Far from it; he had fallen, almost invariably, at the first shower
of the adversary&rsquo;s darts. And now, was he not trying, desperately,
to show her that Ana&rsquo;s babe was blind, hopelessly so?
Was he not fighting on evil&rsquo;s side, and vigorously, though with
shame suffusing his face, waving aloft the banner of error?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with you, Padre,&rdquo; the girl resumed, after some
moments of reflection, &ldquo;is that you&ndash;&ndash;you see everything&ndash;&ndash;well,
you see everything as a person, or a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I always associate thought with personality?&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! But you have got to learn to deal with thoughts
and ideas by themselves, apart from any person or thing. You
have got to learn to deal with facts and their opposites entirely
apart from places, or things, or people. Now if I say that Life
is eternal, I have stated a mental thing. That is the fact. Its
opposite, that is, the opposite of Life, is death. One opposes
the other. But God is Life. Is God also death? He can&rsquo;t be.
Life is the fact. Then death must be the illusion. That being
so, Life is the reality, and death is the unreality. Very well,
what makes death seem real? It is just because the false
thought of death comes into the human mind, and is held there
as a reality, as something that has <i>got</i> to happen. And that
strong belief becomes externalized in what mortals call death.

Don&rsquo;t you see? Is there a person in the whole world who
doesn&rsquo;t think that some time he has got to die? No, not one!
But now suppose every person held the belief that death was an
illusion, a part of the big lie about God, just as Jesus said it
was. Well, wouldn&rsquo;t we get rid of death in a hurry? I should
think so! And is there a person in the whole world who
wouldn&rsquo;t say that Anita&rsquo;s babe was blind? No, not one! They
would look at the human thought of blindness, instead of
God&rsquo;s real idea of sight, and so they would make and keep the
babe blind. Don&rsquo;t you understand me, Padre dear? Don&rsquo;t
you? I know you do, for you really see as God sees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped for breath. Her eyes glistened, and her whole
body seemed to radiate the light of knowledge divine. Then
she went hurriedly on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, everything is mental. You know that, for you told
me so, long since. Well, that being so, we have got to face
the truth that every mental fact seems to have an opposite, or
a lot of opposites, also seemingly mental. The opposite of a
fact is an illusion. The opposite of truth is a lie. Well, God is
the great fact. Infinite mind is the infinite fact. The so-called
opposite of this infinite fact is the human mind, the many so-called
minds of mankind&ndash;&ndash;<i>a kind of man.</i> But everything is
still mental. Now, an illusion, or a lie, does not <i>really</i> exist.
If I tell you that two and two are seven, that lie does not exist.
Is it in what we call my mind, or yours? No. Even if you say
you believe it, that doesn&rsquo;t make it real. Nor does it show that
it has real existence in your mind. Not a bit of it! But&ndash;&ndash;if
you hold it, and cling to it&ndash;&ndash;allow it to stay with you and influence
you&ndash;&ndash;why, Padre dear, everything in your whole life will
be changed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take your pencil&ndash;&ndash;and a piece of paper. Look
now,&rdquo; drawing a line down through the paper. &ldquo;On one side,
Padre, is the infinite mind, God, and all His thoughts and ideas,
all good, perfect and eternal. On the other side is the lie about
it all. That is still mental; but it is illusion, falsity. It includes
all sin, all sickness, all murder, all evil, accidents, loss,
failure, bad ambitions, and death. These are all parts of the
big lie about God&ndash;&ndash;His unreal opposite. These are the so-called
thoughts that come to the human mind. Where do they come
from? From nowhere. The human mind looks at them, tastes
them, feels them, holds them; and then they become its beliefs.
After a while the human mind looks at nothing but these beliefs.
It believes them to be real. And, finally, it comes to
believe that God made them and sent them to His children.
Isn&rsquo;t it awful, Padre! And aren&rsquo;t you glad that you know
about it? And aren&rsquo;t you going to learn how to keep the good
on one side of that line and the illusion on the other?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page291' name='book2_page291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>It seemed to Jos&egrave; a thing incredible that these words were
coming from a girl of fifteen. And yet he knew that at the
same tender age he was as deeply serious as she&ndash;&ndash;but with
this difference: he was then tenaciously clinging to the thoughts
that she was now utterly repudiating as unreal and non-existent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; the girl resumed, &ldquo;everything is mental. The
whole universe is mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied reflectively, &ldquo;at least our comprehension
of it is wholly mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;it is all inside&ndash;&ndash;it is all in our thought! Padre,
when Hernando plays on that old pipe of his, where is the
music? Is it in the pipe? Or is it in our thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>chiquita</i>, we don&rsquo;t seem to have it in our thought
until we seem to see him playing on the pipe, do we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And do you know why? It is
just because the human mind believes that everything, even
music, must come from matter&ndash;&ndash;must have a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have a material origin? Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And men even believe that life itself has a material
origin; and so they have wasted centuries trying to find it in
the body. They don&rsquo;t seem to want to know that God is life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, <i>chiquita</i>, you do not believe that matter is real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no matter outside of us, or around us, Padre,&rdquo;
she said in reply. &ldquo;The human mind looks at its thoughts and
seems to see them out around it as things made of matter. But,
after all, it only sees its thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose that the externalization of our thought in
our consciousness constitutes what we call space, does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must, Padre,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>He studied a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>, how do you know me? What do you see that
you call &lsquo;me&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, I see you as God does&ndash;&ndash;at least, I try always
to see you that way?&rdquo; she answered earnestly. &ldquo;And that is
the way Jesus always saw people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God sees me, of course. But, does He see me as I see myself?&rdquo;
he mused aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not see yourself, Padre,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;You see
only the thoughts that you call yourself. Thoughts of mind
and body and all those things that go to form a human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;yes, I must agree with you there; for, though God
certainly knows me, He cannot know me as I think I know
myself, sinful and discordant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows the real &lsquo;you,&rsquo; Padre dear. And that is just as
He is. He knows that the unreal &lsquo;you,&rsquo; the &lsquo;you&rsquo; that you think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page292' name='book2_page292'></a>292</span>
you know, is illusion. If He knew the human, mortal &lsquo;you&rsquo; as
real, He would have to know evil. And that can not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for the Bible says He is of eyes too pure to behold evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre, why don&rsquo;t you try to be like Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl needed not that he should answer her question.
She knew why he had failed, for &ldquo;without faith it is impossible
to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he
is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&rdquo;
She knew that Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s struggle to overcome evil had been futile,
because he had first made evil real. She knew that the difficulty
he had experienced in keeping his thought straight was because
he persisted in looking at both the good and the evil. Lot&rsquo;s
wife, in the Bible allegory, had turned back to look at things
material and had been transformed into a pillar of salt. Jos&egrave;
had turned again and again to his materialistic thoughts; and
had been turned each time to salt tears. She knew that he
gave up readily, that he yielded easily to evil&rsquo;s strongest tool,
discouragement, and fell back into self-condemnation, whereby
he only rendered still more real to himself the evil which he
was striving to overcome. She knew that the only obstacle that
he was wrestling with in his upward progress was the universal
belief in a power other than God, good, which is so firmly fixed
in the human consciousness. But she likewise knew that this
hindrance was but a false conviction, and that it could and
would be overcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she reflected, looking up at him in great seriousness,
&ldquo;if a lie had an origin, it would be true, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded her attentively, but without replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jesus said that Satan was the father of lies. And
Satan, since he is the father of lies, must himself be a lie. You
see, Padre, we can go right back to the very first chapter in
the Bible. First comes the account of the real creation. Then
comes the account as the human mind looks at it. But that
comes after the &lsquo;mist&rsquo; had gone up from the ground, from
dirt, from matter. Don&rsquo;t you see? That mist was error, the
opposite of Good. It was evil, the opposite of God. It was the
human mind and all human thought, the opposite of the infinite
Mind, God, and His thought. The mist went up from matter.
So every bit of evil that you can possibly think of comes from
the material, physical senses. Evil is always a mist, hiding the
good. Isn&rsquo;t it so? The physical universe, the universe of matter,
is the way the human mind sees its thoughts of the spiritual
universe that was created by God. The human mind is just
a bundle of these false thoughts; and you yourself have said
that the human consciousness was a &lsquo;thought-activity, concerned
with the activity of false thought.&rsquo; The human mind is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page293' name='book2_page293'></a>293</span>
the lie about the infinite mind. It is the mistake, the illusion.
It is like a mistake in mathematics. It has no principle, and
nothing to stand on. The minute you turn the truth upon it,
why, it vanishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, <i>chiquita</i>, why don&rsquo;t people turn the truth upon
it everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are mesmerized by the error, Padre. They
sit looking at these false thoughts and believing them true.
Padre, all disease, all evil, comes from the false thought in the
human mind. It is that thought externalized in the human
consciousness. And when the human mind turns from them,
and puts them out, and lets the true thoughts in, why&ndash;&ndash;why,
<i>then we will raise the dead</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>chiquita</i>, the human body&ndash;&ndash;if it has died&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;the human body and human
mind are one and the same. The body is in the mind. The
body that you think you see is but your thought of a body, and
<i>is in your so-called human mind</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really understand that, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And so would you if you read
your Bible in the right way. Why&ndash;&ndash;I had never seen a Bible
until you gave me yours. I didn&rsquo;t know what a book it was!
And to think that it has been in the world for thousands of
years, and yet people still kill one another, still get sick, and
still die! I don&rsquo;t see how they can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>chiquita</i>, people are too busy to devote time to demonstrating
the truths of the Bible,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too busy!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Busy with what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;busy making money&ndash;&ndash;busy socially&ndash;&ndash;busy having a
good time&ndash;&ndash;busy accumulating things that&ndash;&ndash;that they must go
away and leave to somebody else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;They are like the people Jesus
spoke of, too busy with things that are of no account to see
the things that are&ndash;&ndash;that are&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That are priceless, <i>chiquita</i>&ndash;&ndash;that are the most vital of all
things to sinful, suffering mankind,&rdquo; he supplied.</p>
<p>Rosendo looked in at the door. Jos&egrave; motioned him away.
These hours with Carmen had become doubly precious to him
of late. Perhaps he felt a presentiment that the net about him
and his loved ones was drawing rapidly tighter. Perhaps he
saw the hour swiftly approaching, even at hand, when these
moments of spiritual intercourse would be rudely terminated.
And perhaps he saw the clouds lowering ever darker above
them, and knew that in the blackness which was soon to fall the
girl would leave him and be swept out into the great world of
human thoughts and events, to meet, alone with her God, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page294' name='book2_page294'></a>294</span>
fiercest elements, the subtlest wiles, of the carnal mind. As for
himself&ndash;&ndash;he was in the hands of that same God.</p>
<p>He turned again to the girl. &ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do
not find mistakes in the Bible? For, out in the big world where
I came from, there are many, very many, who say that it is
a book of inconsistencies, of gross inaccuracies, and that its
statements are directly opposed to the so-called natural sciences.
They say that it doesn&rsquo;t even relate historical events accurately.
But, after all, the Bible is just the record of the unfoldment in
the human consciousness of the concept of God. Why cavil
at it when it contains, as we must see, a revelation of the full
formula for salvation, which, as you say, is right-thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre. And it even tells us what to think about. Paul
said, you know, that we should think about whatsoever things
are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. Well,
he told us that there was no law&ndash;&ndash;not even any human law&ndash;&ndash;against
those things. And don&rsquo;t you know, he wrote about
bringing into captivity every thought to Christ? What did he
mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what you have been telling me, I guess, <i>chiquita</i>:
that every thought must be measured by the Christ-principle.
And if it doesn&rsquo;t conform to that standard, it must be rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And then he said that he died daily. He did die
daily to evil, to all evil thought&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to the testimony of the physical senses, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have! For, in proving God to be real, he had to
prove the reports of the five physical senses to be only human
beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, <i>chiquita</i>. He must have known that the
corporeal senses were the only source from which evil came.
He must have known that unless God testified in regard to
things, any other testimony was but carnal belief. This must
be so, for God, being infinite mind, is also infinite intelligence.
He knows all things, and knows them aright&ndash;&ndash;not as the human
mind thinks it knows them, twisted and deformed, but right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Padre. You know now that you see it right.
And can&rsquo;t you <i>stick</i> to it, and prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he answered, shaking his head again, his words
still voicing a lingering note of doubt, &ldquo;it may be&ndash;&ndash;the &lsquo;I&rsquo; that
I call myself may be entirely human, unreal, mortal. I make
no doubt it is, for it seems filled to the brim with discordant
thoughts. And it will pass away. And then&ndash;&ndash;then what will
be left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre!&rdquo; she cried, with a trace of exasperation.
&ldquo;Empty yourself of the wrong thoughts&ndash;&ndash;shut the door against
them&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t let them in any more! Then fill yourself with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page295' name='book2_page295'></a>295</span>
God&rsquo;s thoughts. Then when the mortal part fades away, why,
the good will be left. And it will be the right &lsquo;you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall I empty myself, and then fill myself again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; cried the girl, springing from her chair and stamping
her foot with each word to give it emphasis. &ldquo;It is love,
love, love, nothing but love! Forget yourself, and love everything
and everybody, the real things and the real bodies! Love
God, and good, and good thoughts! Turn from the bad and
the unreal&ndash;&ndash;forget it! Why&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;A great war is threatening
our country at this very minute. Shall I turn from it
and let come what may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated not. &ldquo;No! But you can know that war comes
only from the human mind; that it is bad thought externalized;
and that God is peace, and is infinitely greater than such bad
thought; and He will take care of you&ndash;&ndash;if you will let Him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do I let Him? By sitting back and folding my
hands and saying, Here am I, Lord, protect me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Padre dear, you make me ashamed of your foolish
thought&ndash;&ndash;which isn&rsquo;t your thought at all, but just thought that
seems to be calling itself &lsquo;you.&rsquo; Jesus said, He that believeth
on me, the works that I do shall he do likewise. But that did
not mean sitting back with folded hands. It meant <i>understanding</i>
him; and knowing that there is no power apart from
the Christ-principle; and using that principle, using it every
moment, <i>hard</i>; and with it overcoming every thought that
doesn&rsquo;t come from God, every thought of the human mind,
whether it is called war, or sickness, or death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then evil can be thought away, <i>chiquita</i>?&rdquo; He knew not
why he pursued her so relentlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; she replied with a gentle patience that smote
him. &ldquo;No, Padre. But it can be destroyed in the human mind.
And when you have overcome the habit of thinking the wrong
way, evil will disappear. That is the whole thing. That is
what Jesus tried to make the people see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; knew it. Yet he had not put it to the proof. He
had gone through life, worrying himself loose from one human
belief, only to become enslaved to another equally insidious.
He knew that the cause of whatever came to him was within
his own mentality. And yet he knew, likewise, that he would
have to demonstrate this&ndash;&ndash;that he would be called upon to
&ldquo;prove&rdquo; God. His faith without the works following was dead.
He felt that he did not really believe in power opposed to God;
and yet he did constantly yield to such belief. And such yielding
was the chief of sins. The unique Son of God had said so.
He knew that when the Master had said, &ldquo;Behold, I give you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page296' name='book2_page296'></a>296</span>
power over all the enemy,&rdquo; he meant that the Christ-principle
would overcome every false claim of the human mentality,
whether that claim be one of physical condition or action, or a
claim of environment and event. He knew that all things were
possible to God, and likewise to the one who understood and
faithfully applied the Christ-principle. Carmen believed that
good alone was real and present. She applied this knowledge
to every-day affairs. And in so doing she denied reality to
evil. He must let go. He must turn upon the claims of evil
to life and intelligence. His false sense of righteousness <i>must</i>
give place to the spiritual sense of God as immanent good. He
knew that Carmen&rsquo;s great love was an impervious armor,
which turned aside the darts of the evil one, the one lie. He
knew that his reasoning from the premise of mixed good and
evil was false, and the results chaotic. And knowing all this,
he knew that he had touched the hem of the garment of the
Christ-understanding. There remained, then, the test of fire.
And it had come. Would he stand?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Carmen, going to him and putting her arms
about his neck, &ldquo;you say that you think a great war is coming.
But you needn&rsquo;t be afraid. Don&rsquo;t you remember what it says
in the book of Isaiah? &lsquo;No weapon that is formed against
thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against
thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of
the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me,
saith the Lord.&rsquo; No weapon of evil can touch you, if you understand
God. Every tongue of the human mind that rises to
judge you, to sentence you, shall be condemned. You will
condemn it&ndash;&ndash;you <i>must</i>! This is your heritage, given you by
God. And your righteousness, your right-thinking, must come
from God. Your thoughts must be His. Then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he said, drawing her to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Padre, you will promise me that you will know
every day that Anita&rsquo;s babe is not blind&ndash;&ndash;that it sees, because
God sees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>, I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she murmured, nestling close to him, &ldquo;I love
you so much, so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered not, except in the tightening of the arm that
was about her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 31</h2>
</div>
<p>In the weeks that followed there were days when the very
air seemed pregnant with potential destruction, awaiting
only the daring hand that would render it kinetic. Jos&egrave;
dwelt in a state of incessant, heart-shaking agitation. The sudden
precipitation of the revolt six years before had caught him
wholly unprepared, unaware even of the events which had led
to it. In the intervening years, however, he had had some
opportunity, even in his isolation, to study political conditions
in that unhappy country, and to form some estimate of the
mental forces at work in both Church and State which, he
knew, must ultimately bring them again into conflict for supremacy.
His knowledge of the workings of the human mind
convinced him that Diego&rsquo;s dire prophecy had not been empty;
that the Church, though ostensibly assuming only spiritual
leadership, would nevertheless rest not until the question
&ldquo;Who shall be greatest?&rdquo; even in the petty, sordid affairs of
mortals, should be answered, and answered&ndash;&ndash;though by force
of arms&ndash;&ndash;in her favor. And his estimate of the strength of
the opposing parties had led him to believe that the impending
struggle would drench the land in blood.</p>
<p>As to the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which Wenceslas would play, he could form
no satisfactory estimate. He knew him to be astute, wary, and
the shrewdest of politicians. He knew, likewise, that he was
acting in conjunction with powerful financial interests in both
North America and Europe. He knew him to be a man who
would stop at no scruple, hesitate at no dictate of conscience,
yield to no moral or ethical code; one who would play Rome
against Wall Street, with his own unfortunate country as the
stake; one who would hurl the fairest sons of Colombia at one
another&rsquo;s throats to bulge his own coffers; and then wring
from the wailing widows their poor substance for Masses to
move their beloved dead through an imagined purgatory.</p>
<p>But he could not know that, in casting about impatiently
for an immediate <i>causus belli</i>, Wenceslas had hit upon poor,
isolated, little Simit&iacute; as the point of ignition, and the pitting of
its struggling priest against Don Mario as the method of exciting
the necessary spark. He could not know that Wenceslas
had represented to the Departmental Governor in Cartagena
that an obscure <i>Cura</i> in far-off Simit&iacute;, an exile from the Vatican,
and the author of a violent diatribe against papal authority,
was the nucleus about which anticlerical sentiment was
crystallizing in the Department of Bol&iacute;var. He did not know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page298' name='book2_page298'></a>298</span>
that the Governor had been induced by the acting-Bishop&rsquo;s
specious representations to send arms to Simit&iacute;, to be followed
by federal troops only when the crafty Wenceslas saw
that the time was ripe. He did not even suspect that Don
Mario was to be the puppet whom Wenceslas would sacrifice
on the altar of rapacity when he had finished with him, and
that the simple-minded Alcalde in his blind zeal to protect the
Church would thereby proclaim himself an enemy of both
Church and State, and afford the smiling Wenceslas the most
fortuitous of opportunities to reveal the Church&rsquo;s unexampled
magnanimity by throwing her influence in with that of the
Government against their common enemy.</p>
<p>His own intercourse with Wenceslas during the years of his
exile in Simit&iacute; had been wholly formal, and not altogether disagreeable
as long as the contributions of gold to the Bishop&rsquo;s
leaking coffers continued. He had received almost monthly
communications from Cartagena, relating to the Church at
large, and, at infrequent intervals, to the parish of Simit&iacute;. But
he knew that Cartagena&rsquo;s interest in Simit&iacute; was merely casual&ndash;&ndash;nay,
rather, financial&ndash;&ndash;and he strove to maintain it so, lest
the stimulation of a deeper interest thwart his own plans.
His conflict with Diego in regard to Carmen had seemed for
the moment to evoke the Bishop&rsquo;s interference; and the sudden
and unaccountable disappearance of that priest had threatened
to expose both Jos&egrave; and Carmen to the full scrutiny of
Wenceslas. But, fortunately, the insistence of those matters
which were rapidly culminating in a political outbreak left
Wenceslas little time for interference in affairs which did not
pertain exclusively to the momentous questions with which
he was now concerned, and Jos&egrave; and Carmen were still left
unmolested. It was only when, desperate lest Congress adjourn
without passing the measure which he knew would
precipitate the conflict, and when, well nigh panic-stricken
lest his collusion with Ames and his powerful clique of Wall
Street become known through the exasperation of the latter
over the long delay, he had resolved to pit Don Mario against
Jos&egrave; in distant Simit&iacute;, and, in that unknown, isolated spot,
where close investigation would never be made, apply the
torch to the waiting combustibles, that Jos&egrave; saw the danger
which had always hung over him and the girl suddenly descending
upon them and threatening anew the separation which
he had ever regarded as inevitable, and yet which he had hoped
against hope to avoid.</p>
<p>With the deposition of arms in Simit&iacute;, and the establishment
of federal authority in Don Mario, that always pompous
official rose in his own esteem and in the eyes of a few parasitical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page299' name='book2_page299'></a>299</span>
attach&eacute;s to an eminence never before dreamed of by
the humble denizens of this moss-encrusted town. From egotistical,
Don Mario became insolent. From sluggishness and
torpidity of thought and action, he rose suddenly into tremendous
activity. He was more than once observed by Jos&egrave;
or Rosendo emerging hastily from his door and button-holing
some one of the more influential citizens of the town and excitedly
reading to him excerpts from letters which he had just
received from Cartagena. He might be seen at any hour of the
day in the little <i>patio</i> back of his store, busily engaged with
certain of the men of the place in examining papers and documents,
talking volubly and with much excited gesticulation
and wild rolling of the eyes. A party seemed to be crystallizing
about him. His hitherto uncertain prestige appeared to be
soaring greatly. Men who before made slighting remarks
about him, or opposed his administrative acts, were now often
seen in earnest converse with him. His manner toward Jos&egrave;
and Rosendo became that of utter contempt. He often refused
to notice the priest as they passed in the streets.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s apprehension waxed great. It attained its climax
when Rosendo came to him one day to discuss the Alcalde&rsquo;s
conduct and the change of sentiment which seemed to be stealing
rapidly over the hearts of the people of Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said the old man in perplexity, &ldquo;I cannot say what
it is, but Don Mario has some scheme in hand, and&ndash;&ndash;and I do
not think it is for our good. I cannot get anything out of those
with whom he talks so continually, but L&aacute;zaro tells me that&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
that he learns that Don Mario suspects you of&ndash;&ndash;of not
belonging to the Church party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; smiled. Don Mario&rsquo;s suspicions about him had been
many and varied, especially as La Libertad mine had not been
discovered. He said as much to Rosendo in reply; and as he
did so, he thought the old man&rsquo;s face took on a queer and unwonted
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo; continued Rosendo at length, &ldquo;they say that
Don Mario has word from the Bishop that you once wrote a
book against the Holy Father&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; The words burst from the priest&rsquo;s lips like
the sudden issuance of pent steam. Rosendo stared at him
in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo!&rdquo; gasped Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;How know you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, Padre! it is what L&aacute;zaro tells me,&rdquo; replied the
old man, his own suspicion verging upon conviction.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s dark face became almost white, and his breath
sobbed out in gasps. A vague idea of the game Wenceslas was
playing now stole through his throbbing brain. That book,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page300' name='book2_page300'></a>300</span>
his Nemesis, his pursuing Fate, had tracked him to this secluded
corner of the earth, and in the hands of the most unscrupulous
politician of South America was being used as a tool.
But, precisely to what end, his wild thought did not as yet
disclose. Still, above the welter of it all, he saw clearly that
there must be no further delay on his part. Before he could
speak, however, Rosendo had resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had it occurred to you that you were
watched, day and night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;heavens!&rdquo; Jos&egrave; had not suspected such a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, Padre. Don Mario&rsquo;s men keep you in sight during
the day; and at night there is always some one hovering near
your house. You could not escape now even if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sank back in his chair limp and cold. His frenzied
brain held but one thought: he had delayed until too late&ndash;&ndash;and
the end was at hand!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo earnestly, &ldquo;tell me about that book.
You did write it? And against the Holy Father? But&ndash;&ndash;you
still say the Mass. You have not brought Carmen up in the
Church. But it was I who told you not to&ndash;&ndash;that her heart was
her church, and it must not be disturbed. But&ndash;&ndash;is it true, as
the people say, that you really belong to the party that would
destroy the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jos&egrave; collected himself. While his heart burned
within his breast, he opened its portals and revealed to Rosendo
all that lay within. Beginning with his boyhood, he
drew his career out before the wondering eyes of the old man
down to the day when the culmination of carnal ambition,
false thought, perverted concepts of filial devotion and sacredness
of oath, of family honor and pride of race, had washed
him up against the dreary shores of Simit&iacute;. With no thought
of concealment, he exposed his ambition in regard to Carmen&ndash;&ndash;even
the love for her that he knew must die of inanition&ndash;&ndash;and
ended by throwing himself without reserve upon Rosendo&rsquo;s
judgment. When the tense recital was ended, Rosendo leaned
over and clasped the priest&rsquo;s trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, Padre,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I am dull of wit,
I know. And you have often laughed at my superstitions and
old family beliefs, whether religious or otherwise. They are
strange&ndash;&ndash;I admit that. And I shall die in the Church, and
take my chances on the future, for I have tried to live a good
life. But&ndash;&ndash;with a man like you&ndash;&ndash;I understand. And now,
Padre, we have no time to be sorrowful. We must be up and
doing. We are like fish in a net. But&ndash;&ndash;my life is yours. And
both are Carmen&rsquo;s, is it not so? Thanks be to the good Virgin,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page301' name='book2_page301'></a>301</span>
he muttered, as he walked slowly away, &ldquo;that L&aacute;zaro got those
titles from Don Mario to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Nightfall brought an unexpected visitor in the person of
Don Jorge, who had returned from the remoter parts of the
Guamoc&oacute; region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, and what news?&rdquo; he called cheerily, as he strode
into the parish house, where Rosendo and Jos&egrave; were in earnest
conversation.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; embraced him as a brother, while a great sense of
relief stole over him. Then he quickly made known to him
the situation.</p>
<p>Don Jorge whistled softly. He ceased his task of scraping
the caked mud from his bare limbs, and drew up a chair near
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you wrote a book, no? And rapped the sacred priesthood?
<i>Hombre</i>! That is good! I never did think you a real
priest. But, <i>amigo</i>, lend me a copy, for I doubt not it is most
excellent reading, and will serve to while away many a weary
hour in the jungle.&rdquo; His eyes snapped merrily, and he slapped
Jos&egrave; roundly upon the back when he finished speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued more seriously, &ldquo;things seem to be
setting against you, friend. However, let me but canvass the
town to-morrow, and by evening I can advise. <i>Caramba</i>! this
old hole a military depot! Who would have thought it! And
yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;I wonder why the Governor sends arms here.
<i>Bien</i>, we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge needed not a full day to correctly estimate the
situation in Simit&iacute;. His bluff, hearty manner and genial good-nature
constituted a passport to every house, and by midday
he had talked with nearly every man in the <i>pueblo</i>. He called
Jos&egrave; and Rosendo for consultation during the <i>siesta</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; he said, when they were seated in the parish house,
&ldquo;Don Mario without doubt descends from the very serpent that
tempted our mother Eve! He has become a person of considerable
importance since the Governor and Don Wenceslas
strive with each other to rest their authority and confidence
in him. And, unless I mistake much, they have him slated
for important work. However that may be, the man already
has a large following. Moreover, he has them well poisoned
against you, <i>amigo</i> Jos&egrave;. They know more details about your
book and your life before coming to Simit&iacute; than do you. <i>Bien</i>,
you must counteract the Alcalde&rsquo;s influence by a public statement.
It must be to-night&ndash;&ndash;in the church! You will have to
act quickly, for the old fox has you picked for trouble! Diego&rsquo;s
disappearance, you know; the girl, Carmen; your rather foolish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page302' name='book2_page302'></a>302</span>
course here&ndash;&ndash;it is all laid up against you, friend, and you must
meet it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; assented. Don Jorge went out and summoned the
town to a meeting in the church that evening. Immediately
Don Mario issued a mandate forbidding a public gathering at
a time of such stress. The people began to assemble on the
street corners and in front of their houses to discuss the situation.
Their talk became loud and animated. Threats were
heard. The people were becoming divided. Don Jorge was
everywhere, and none could talk so volubly nor gesticulate and
expectorate so vehemently as he.</p>
<p>At sundown the people moved toward the <i>plaza</i>. Then the
concourse drifted slowly into the church. Don Jorge dragged
Jos&egrave; from the parish house and up to the altar. &ldquo;You have
got to divide them, Padre!&rdquo; he whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Your
only hope now lies in the formation of your own party to
oppose the Alcalde! Talk to them as you never talked before!
Say all that you had stored up to say on Judgment Day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, as Jos&egrave; faced his little flock and saw them, bare of
feet, scantily clad in their simple cotton and calico, their faces
set in deep seriousness, the ludicrous side of the whole situation
flashed before him, and he almost laughed aloud at the
spectacle which the ancient, decayed town at that moment
presented. These primitive folk&ndash;&ndash;they were but children, with
all a child&rsquo;s simplicity of nature, its petulance, its immaturity
of view, and its sudden and unreasoning acceptance of authority!
He turned to the altar and took up a tall brass crucifix.
He held it out before him for a moment. Then he called upon
the Christ to witness to the truth of what he was about to say.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the assembly. Even Don Mario seemed to
become calm after that dramatic spectacle. Then Jos&egrave; spoke.
He talked long and earnestly. He knew not that such eloquence
abode within him. His declamation became more and
more impassioned. He opened wide his heart and called upon
all present to look fearlessly within. Yes, he had written the
book in question. But its publication was unfortunate. Yes,
it had expressed his views at that time. But now&ndash;&ndash;ah, now!</p>
<p>He stopped and looked about the church. The shadows
were gathering thick, and the smoking kerosene lamps battled
vainly with the heavy blackness. In a far corner of the room
he saw Carmen and Ana. Rosendo sat stolidly beside them.
The sightless babe waved its tiny hands in mute helplessness,
while Do&ntilde;a Maria held it closely to her bosom. Carmen&rsquo;s last
admonition sang in his ears. He must know&ndash;&ndash;really <i>know</i>&ndash;&ndash;that
the babe could see! He must know that God was omnipotent!
His appeal to the people was not for himself. He cared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page303' name='book2_page303'></a>303</span>
not what became of him. But Carmen&ndash;&ndash;and now Ana and the
blind babe&ndash;&ndash;and the calm, unimpassioned Do&ntilde;a Maria, the
embodiment of all that was greatest in feminine character&ndash;&ndash;and
Rosendo, waiting to lay down his life for those he loved!
And then, this people, soon, he felt, to be shattered by the
shock of war&ndash;&ndash;ah, God above! what could he say that might
save them? If they could know, as Carmen did, if they could
love and trust as she did, would the hideous spectre of war
ever stalk among them? Could the world know, and love, and
trust as did this fair child, would it waste itself in useless
wars, sink with famine and pestilence, consume with the anguish
of fear, and in the end bury its blasted hopes in the dank,
reeking tomb? The thought gave wings to his voice, soul to
his words. For hours the people sat spellbound.</p>
<p>Then he finished. He raised his hands in benediction.
And, while the holy hush remained upon the people, he descended
the altar steps, his frame still tremulous with the
vehemence of his appeal, and went alone to his house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 32</h2>
</div>
<p>Dawn had scarcely reddened in the east when a number
of men assembled at Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have turned the trick, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; said Don Jorge,
rousing up from his <i>petate</i> on the floor beside the priest&rsquo;s bed.
&ldquo;You have won over a few of them, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; went out to meet the early callers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come to say, Padre,&rdquo; announced Andres Arellano, the
dignified spokesman, &ldquo;that we have confidence in your words
of last night. We suspect Don Mario, even though he has
letters from the Bishop. We are your men, and we would
keep the war away from Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were five of them, strong of heart and brawny of
arm. &ldquo;And there will be more, Padre,&rdquo; added Andres, reading
the priest&rsquo;s question in his appraising glance.</p>
<p>Thus was the town divided; and while many clung to the
Alcalde, partly through fear of offending the higher ecclesiastical
authority, and partly because of imagined benefits to be
gained, others, and a goodly number, assembled at Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s side,
and looked to him to lead them in the crisis which all felt to
be at hand. As the days passed, the priest&rsquo;s following grew
more numerous, until, after the lapse of a week, the town
stood fairly divided. Don Jorge announced his intention of
remaining in Simit&iacute; for the present.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page304' name='book2_page304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>From the night of the meeting in the church excitement
ran continuously higher. Business was at length suspended;
the fishermen forgot their nets; and the limber tongues of the
town gossips steadily increased their clatter. Don Mario&rsquo;s store
and <i>patio</i> assumed the functions of a departmental office. Daily
he might be seen laboriously drafting letters of incredible
length and wearisome prolixity to acting-Bishop Wenceslas;
and nightly he was engaged in long colloquies and whispered
conferences with Don Luis and others of his followers and
hangers-on. The government arms had been brought up from
Bodega Central and stored in an empty warehouse belonging
to Don Felipe Alcozer to await further disposition.</p>
<p>But with the arrival of the arms, and of certain letters which
Don Mario received from Cartagena, the old town lost its calm
of centuries, not to recover it again for many a dreary day.
By the time its peace was finally restored, it had received a
blow from which it never recovered. And many a familiar
face, too, had disappeared forever from its narrow streets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jos&egrave; and his followers anxiously awaited the
turn of events. It came at length, and in a manner not wholly
unexpected. The Alcalde in his voluminous correspondence
with Wenceslas had not failed to bring against Jos&egrave; every
charge which his unduly stimulated brain could imagine. But
in particular did he dwell upon the priest&rsquo;s malign influence
upon Carmen, whose physical beauty and powers of mind were
the marvel of Simit&iacute;. He hammered upon this with an insistence
that could not but at length again attract the thought of
the acting-Bishop, who wrote finally to Don Mario, expressing
the mildly couched opinion that, now that his attention had
been called again to the matter, Carmen should have the benefits
of the education and liberal training which a convent would
afford.</p>
<p>Don Mario&rsquo;s egotism soared to the sky. The great Bishop
was actually being advised by him! <i>Hombre</i>! Where would
it not end! He would yet remove to a larger town, perhaps
Mompox, and, with the support of the great ecclesiastic, stand
for election to Congress! He would show the Bishop what
mettle he had in him. <i>Hombre</i>! And first he would show
His Grace how a loyal servant could anticipate his master&rsquo;s
wishes. He summoned Fernando, and imperiously bade him
bring the girl Carmen at once.</p>
<p>But Fernando returned, saying that Rosendo refused to
give up the child. Don Mario then ordered Rosendo&rsquo;s arrest.
But Fernando found it impossible to execute the commission.
Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge stood with Rosendo, and threatened to
deal harshly with the constable should he attempt to take Carmen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page305' name='book2_page305'></a>305</span>
by force. Fernando then sought to impress upon the
Alcalde the danger of arousing public opinion again over the
girl.</p>
<p>Don Mario&rsquo;s wrath burst forth like an exploding bomb. He
seized his straw hat and his cane, the emblem of his office, and
strode to the house of Rosendo. His face grew more deeply
purple as he went. At the door of the house he encountered
Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; began Jos&egrave;, before the Alcalde could get his
words shaped, &ldquo;it is useless. Carmen remains with us. We
will defend her with our lives. Be advised, Don Mario, for
the consequences of thoughtless action may be incalculable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; bellowed the irate official, &ldquo;but, cow-face! do
you know that His Grace supports me? That I but execute his
orders? <i>Dios arriba</i>! if you do not at once deliver to me your
paramour&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got no further. Rosendo, who had been standing just
within the door, suddenly pushed Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge aside
and, stalking out, a tower of flesh, confronted the raging Alcalde.
For a moment he gazed down into the pig-eyes of the
man. Then, with a quick thrust of his thick arm, he projected
his huge fist squarely into Don Mario&rsquo;s bloated face.
The Alcalde went down like a shot.</p>
<p>Neither Jos&egrave; nor Don Jorge, as they rushed in between Rosendo
and his fallen adversary, had any adequate idea of the
consequences of the old man&rsquo;s precipitate action. As they
assisted the prostrate official to his unsteady feet they knew not
that to Rosendo, simple, peace-loving, and great of heart, had
fallen the lot to inaugurate hostilities in the terrible anticlerical
war which now for four dismal years was to tear
Colombia from end to end, and leave her prostrate and exhausted
at last, her sons decimated, her farms and industries
ruined, and her neck beneath the heavy heel of a military
despot at Bogot&aacute;, whose pliant hand would still be guided by
the astute brain of Rome.</p>
<p>By the time the startled Alcalde had been set again upon his
feet a considerable concourse had gathered at the scene.
Many stood in wide-eyed horror at what had just occurred.
Others broke into loud and wild talk. The crowd rapidly grew,
and in a few minutes the <i>plaza</i> was full. Supporters of both sides
declaimed and gesticulated vehemently. In the heat of the
arguments a blow was struck. Then another. The Alcalde,
when he found his tongue, shrilly demanded the arrest of Rosendo
and his family, including the priest and Don Jorge. A
dozen of his party rushed forward to execute the order. Rosendo
had slipped between Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge and into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page306' name='book2_page306'></a>306</span>
house. In a trice he emerged with a great <i>machete</i>. The people
about him fell back. His eyes blazed like live coals, and
his breath seemed to issue from his dilating nostrils like clouds
of steam. To approach him meant instant death. Don Jorge
crept behind him and, gaining the house, collected the terrified
women and held them in readiness for flight. Juan, L&aacute;zaro,
and a number of others surrounded Jos&egrave; and faced the angry
multitude.</p>
<p>The strain was broken by the frenzied Alcalde, who rushed
toward Rosendo. The old man swung his enormous <i>machete</i>
with a swirl that, had it met the official, would have clean decapitated
him. But, fortunately, one of the priest&rsquo;s supporters
threw out his foot, and the corpulent Alcalde fell heavily over
it and bit the dust. Jos&egrave; threw himself upon Rosendo. The
old man staggered with the shock and gave way. The priest
turned to the excited crowd. Holding up both hands high
above his head, he sent out his voice clear and loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children! In the name of the Church! In the name of
the Christ! The blessed Virgin&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What know you of the blessed Virgin, priest of Satan?&rdquo;
shouted a rough follower of the Alcalde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; yelled another. &ldquo;Writer of foul books! Seducer
of young girls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julio Gomez stooped and took up a large piece of shale.
He threw it with all his force, just as the priest again strove
to make his voice heard above the din. It struck Jos&egrave; full on
the forehead. The jagged stone cut deeply, and the red blood
spurted. Jos&egrave; fell into the arms of L&aacute;zaro and was dragged
into the house.</p>
<p>Then Rosendo, with a mad yell, plunged wildly into the
crowd. A dozen arms sought to hold him, but in vain. Julio
saw the terrifying apparition hurtling down upon him. He
turned and fled, but not before the great knife had caught
him on its point as it swung down and ripped a deep gash the
full length of his naked back.</p>
<p>Then the last vestige of reason fled from the mob, and chaos
took the reins. Back and forth through the <i>plaza</i>, in front of
the church where hung the image of the Prince of Peace, the
maddened people surged, fighting like demons, raining blows
with clubs, fists, and <i>machetes</i>, stabbing with their long, wicked
knives, hurling sharp stones, gouging, ripping, yelling, shrieking,
calling upon Saints and Virgin to curse their enemies and
bless their blows. Over the heads of them all towered the
mighty frame of Rosendo. Back before his murderous <i>machete</i>
fell the terrified combatants. His course among them was
that of a cannon ball. Dozens hung upon his arms, his shoulders,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page307' name='book2_page307'></a>307</span>
or flung themselves about his great legs. His huge body,
slippery and reeking, was galvanized into energy incarnate.
Sparks seemed to flash from his eyes. His breath turned to
livid flame. Behind him, following in the swath which he cut,
his supporters crowded, fought and yelled. Don Mario&rsquo;s forces
gave way. They cursed, broke, and fled. Then Don Jorge, a
man whose mortal strength was more than common, threw
himself upon the steaming, frenzied Rosendo and stopped his
mad progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;<i>amigo! Caramba!</i> Listen! They are fleeing
to the <i>bodega</i> to get the rifles and ammunition! Come&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dios
arriba</i>! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cut, bruised, and dripping blood from a dozen wounds, Rosendo
stood for a moment blinking in confusion. A score lay
on the ground about him. Whether dead or wounded, he knew
not, nor cared. The sight of Don Mario&rsquo;s supporters in full
flight fascinated him. He broke into a chuckle. It sounded
like the gloating of an imp of Satan. Then the force of Don
Jorge&rsquo;s words smote him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! They will return with the rifles!&rdquo; he panted.
&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! We must lose no time!&rdquo; cried Don Jorge, pulling
him toward the house. Those of the priest&rsquo;s other followers
who were still whole scattered wildly to their homes and
barred their doors. There they searched for knives, <i>machetes</i>,
razors, any tool or instrument that might be pressed into service
as a weapon, and stood guard. One frenzied fellow, the
sole possessor of an antiquated shotgun, projected the rusty
arm from a hole in the wall of his mud hut and blazed away
down the deserted street indiscriminately and without aim.</p>
<p>Within the house Juan and L&aacute;zaro were supporting the
dazed Jos&egrave;, while Do&ntilde;a Maria bathed and bound his wound.
Carmen stood gazing upon the scene in bewilderment. The
precipitousness of the affair had taken her breath away and
driven all thought in mad rout from her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigos</i>!&rdquo; panted Don Jorge, &ldquo;the church&ndash;&ndash;it is the only
place now that is even fairly safe! Do&ntilde;a Maria, do you collect
all the food in the house! We know not how long we may be
prisoners&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Don Jorge,&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave; feebly, &ldquo;they will attack
us even there! Let us flee&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, <i>amigo</i>? To the Guamoc&oacute; trail? Caramba! they
would shoot us down in cold blood! <i>Hombre</i>! There is no
place but the church! That will hold some of them back, at
any rate! And none of them, if they get crazed with <i>anisado</i>!
But it is the only place now! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page308' name='book2_page308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>!&rdquo; cried Rosendo, starting for the door, &ldquo;but do
you, Juan and L&aacute;zaro, follow me with your <i>machetes</i>, and we
will drive the cowards from the <i>bodega</i> and get the rifles ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>amigo</i>! Impossible! By this time they have broken
open the boxes and loaded the guns. A shot&ndash;&ndash;and it would be
all over with you! But in the church&ndash;&ndash;you have a chance
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge seized his arm and dragged him out of the house
and across the deserted <i>plaza</i>. Juan and L&aacute;zaro helped Do&ntilde;a
Maria gather what food and water remained in the house; and
together they hurried out and over to the church. Swinging
open the heavy wooden doors, they entered and made them fast
again. Then they sank upon the benches and strove to realize
their situation.</p>
<p>But Don Jorge suddenly sprang to his feet. &ldquo;The windows!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>
<p>Juan and L&aacute;zaro hurried to them and swung the wooden
shutters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no way of holding them!&rdquo; cried Juan in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; muttered Rosendo, seizing a bench and with
one blow of his <i>machete</i> splitting it clean through, &ldquo;these will
make props to hold them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the work of but a few minutes to place benches
across the thick shutters and secure them with others placed
diagonally against them and let into the hard dirt floor. The
same was done with the doors. Then the little group huddled
together and waited. Jos&egrave; heard a sob beside him, and a
hand clutched his in the gloom. It was Carmen. In the excitement
of the hour he had all but forgotten her. Through
his present confusion of thought a great fact loomed: as the
girl clung to him she was weeping!</p>
<p>A low rumble drifted to them; a confusion of voices, growing
louder; and then a sharp report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming, Padre,&rdquo; muttered Rosendo. &ldquo;And some
one has tried his rifle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the ruck poured into the <i>plaza</i> and made
for Rosendo&rsquo;s house. Don Mario, holding his cane aloft like a
sword, was at their head. Raging with disappointment at not
finding the fugitives in the house, they threw the furniture and
kitchen utensils madly about, punched great holes through
the walls, and then rushed pellmell to the parish house next
door. A groan escaped Jos&egrave; as he watched them through a
chink in the shutters. His books and papers! His notes and
writings!</p>
<p>But as the howling mob streamed toward the parish house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page309' name='book2_page309'></a>309</span>
a wrinkled old crone shrilled at them from across the way and
pointed toward the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there, <i>amigos</i>!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I saw them enter!
Shoot them&ndash;&ndash;they have hurt my Pedro!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back like a huge wave the crowd flowed, and up against the
church doors. Don Mario, at the head of his valiant followers,
held up his hand for silence. Then, planting himself before
the main doors of the church, he loudly voiced his authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Government at Bogot&aacute;!&rdquo; he cried
pompously, tapping the doors with his light cane. Then he
turned quickly. &ldquo;Fernando,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;run to my house and
fetch the drum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the seriousness of their situation, Jos&egrave; smiled at the
puppet-show being enacted without.</p>
<p>The Alcalde reiterated his demands with truculent vanity.
&ldquo;Open! In the name of the Government! I am the law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge groaned aloud. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> if I but had him in
here alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario waited a few moments. Then, as no response
came from within, his anger began to soar. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;but you defy the law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry mutterings rose from the crowd. Some one suggested
burning the building. Another advised battering in the
doors. A third intimated that shooting them full of holes were
better. This idea, once voiced, spread like an infection. The
childish people were eager to try the rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the doors down! Shoot them down, Don Mario!&rdquo;
yelled the mob.</p>
<p>The Alcalde threw himself heavily up against the doors.
&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he shrilled. &ldquo;Fools! Demons! Open!&ndash;&ndash;or it
will be the worse for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; decided that their silence should no longer exasperate
the angry man. He put his mouth to the crevice between the
doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is sacred ground! The Host
is exposed on the altar. Take your mob away. Disperse, and
we will come out. We may settle this trouble amicably, if you
will but listen to reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde jumped up and down in his towering wrath.
&ldquo;Puppy-face!&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;but I am the law&ndash;&ndash;I am the Government!
A curse upon you, priest of Satan! Will you unbar
these doors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;And if you attack us you attack the
Church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curse on the Church! <i>Amigos!</i> <i>Muchachos!</i>&rdquo; he
bawled, turning to the mob, &ldquo;we will batter down the doors!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page310' name='book2_page310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>The crowd surged forward again. But the props held firm.
Again and again the mob hurled itself upon the thick doors.
They bent, they sagged, but they held. Don Mario became
apoplectic. A torrent of anathemas streamed from his thick
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The side door!&rdquo; some one shouted, recovering a portion of
his scant wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye&ndash;&ndash;and the door of the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the windows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Round the building streamed the crazed mob, without head,
without reason, lusting only for the lives of the frightened
little band huddled together in the gloom within. Jos&egrave; kept an
arm about Carmen. Ana bent sobbing over her tiny babe.
Don Jorge and Rosendo remained mute and grim. Jos&egrave; knew
that those two would cast a long reckoning before they died.
Juan and L&aacute;zaro went from door to window, steadying the
props and making sure that they were holding. The tough,
hard, tropical wood, though pierced in places by <i>comjejen</i>
ants, was resisting.</p>
<p>The sun was already high, and the <i>plaza</i> had become a
furnace. The patience of the mob quickly evaporated in the
ardent heat. Don Mario&rsquo;s wits had gone completely. Revenge,
mingled with insensate zeal to manifest the authority which he
believed his intercourse with Wenceslas had greatly augmented,
had driven all rationality from his motives. Flaming
anger had unseated his reason. Descending from the platform
on which stood the church, he blindly drew up his armed followers
and bade them fire upon the church doors.</p>
<p>If Wenceslas, acting-Bishop by the grace of political machination,
could have witnessed the stirring drama then in
progress in ancient Simit&iacute;, he would have laughed aloud at the
complete fulfillment of his carefully wrought plans. The cunning
of the shrewd, experienced politician had never been more
clearly manifested than in the carrying out of the little program
which he had set for the unwise Alcalde of this almost
unknown little town, whereby the hand of Congress should be
forced and the inevitable revolt inaugurated. Don Mario had
seized the government arms, the deposition of which in Simit&iacute;
in his care had constituted him more than ever the representative
of federal authority. But, in his wild zeal, he had fallen
into the trap which Wenceslas had carefully arranged for him,
and now was engaged in a mad attack upon the Church itself,
upon ecclesiastical authority as vested in the priest Jos&egrave;. How
could Wenceslas interpret this but as an anticlerical uprising?
There remained but the final scene. And while the soft-headed
dupes and maniacal supporters of Don Mario were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page311' name='book2_page311'></a>311</span>
hurling bullets into the thick doors of the old church in Simit&iacute;,
Wenceslas sat musing in his comfortable study in the cathedral
of Cartagena, waiting with what patience he could command
for further reports from Don Mario, whose last letter had informed
him that the arrest of the priest Jos&egrave; and his unfortunate
victim, Carmen, was only a few hours off.</p>
<p>When the first shots rang out, and the bullets ploughed into
the hard wood of the heavy doors, Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart sank, and he
gave himself up as lost. L&aacute;zaro and Juan cowered upon the
floor. Carmen crept close to Jos&egrave;, as he sat limply upon a bench,
and put her arms about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t true&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t true!
They don&rsquo;t really want to kill us! They don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;really! Their
thoughts have only the minus sign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest clasped her to his breast. The recriminating
thought flashed over him that he alone was the cause of this.
He had sacrificed them all&ndash;&ndash;none but he was to blame. Ah,
God above! if he could only offer himself to satiate the mob&rsquo;s
lust, and save these innocent ones! Lurid, condemnatory
thoughts burned through his brain like molten iron. He rose
hastily and rushed to the door. Rosendo and Don Jorge seized
him as he was about to lift a prop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Padre?&rdquo; they exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out, friends&ndash;&ndash;I shall give myself to them for
you all. It is the only way. I am the one they seek. Let them
have me, if they will spare you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the firing had ceased, and Don Mario was approaching
the door. Jos&egrave; bent down and called to him. &ldquo;Myself for the
others, Don Mario!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But promise to spare them&ndash;&ndash;but
give me your word&ndash;&ndash;and I will yield myself to arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, fool priest!&rdquo; shouted the Alcalde in derision.
&ldquo;It is not you that the good Bishop wants, but the girl! I have
his letters demanding that I send her to him! If you will come
out, you shall not be hurt. Only, Rosendo must stand trial
for the harm he did in the fight this morning; and the girl must
go to Cartagena. As for the rest of you, you will be free. Are
the terms not reasonable? Give me your answer in five
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned to the little band. There was awful determination
in his voice. &ldquo;Juan and L&aacute;zaro,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will open a
window quickly in the rear of the church and let you out. It
is not right that you should die with us. And Don Jorge,
too&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop there, <i>amigo!</i>&rdquo; interrupted the latter in a voice as
cold as steel. &ldquo;My life has not the value of a white heron.
Can I do better than give it for a cause that I know to be right?
Nay, man, I remain with you. Let the lads go, if they will&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page312' name='book2_page312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>L&aacute;zaro forced himself between Don Jorge and the priest.
&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;to you I owe what I am. I remain
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; looked through the gloom at Juan. The boy&rsquo;s eyes
were fixed on Carmen. He turned and gazed for a moment at
a window, as if hesitating between two decisions. Then he
shook his head slowly. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he said, though his voice
trembled, &ldquo;I, too, remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Alcalde received his answer with a burst of inarticulate
rage. He rushed back to his followers with his arms waving
wildly. &ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Shoot! Pierce the doors!
Batter them down! <i>Compadres</i>, get the poles and burst in the
shutters. <i>Caramba!</i> it is the Government they are defying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A volley from the rifles followed his words. The thick
doors shook under the blast. A bullet pierced the wall and
whizzed past Carmen. Jos&egrave; seized the girl and drew her down
under a bench. The startled bats among the roof beams fluttered
wildly about through the heavy gloom. Frightened rats
scurried around the altar. The rusty bell in the tower cried
out as if in protest against the sacrilege. Juan burst into tears
and crept beneath a bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Rosendo, &ldquo;it is only a question of time when
the doors will fall. See&ndash;&ndash;that bullet went clean through!
<i>Bien</i>, let us place the women back of the altar, while we men
stand here at one side of the doors, so that when they fall we
may dash out and cut our way through the crowd. If we
throw ourselves suddenly upon them, we may snatch away a
rifle or two. Then Don Jorge and I, with the lads here, may
drive them back&ndash;&ndash;perhaps beat them! But my first blow shall
be for Don Mario! I vow here that, if I escape this place, he
shall not live another hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better so, Rosendo, than that they should take us alive.
But&ndash;&ndash;Carmen? Do we leave her to fall into Don Mario&rsquo;s
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s voice, low and cold, froze the marrow in the
priest&rsquo;s bones. &ldquo;Padre, she will not fall into the Alcalde&rsquo;s
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above! Rosendo, do you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A piercing cry checked him. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen! Padre&ndash;&ndash;!</i>&rdquo;
L&aacute;zaro had collapsed upon the floor. Rosendo and Jos&egrave; hurried
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s breath came in gasps. &ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;I
confess&ndash;&ndash;pray for me. It struck me&ndash;&ndash;here!&rdquo; He struggled to
lay a hand upon his bleeding breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the altar, <i>amigos</i>!&rdquo; cried Don Jorge, ducking his head
as a bullet sang close to it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page313' name='book2_page313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>Seizing the expiring L&aacute;zaro, they hurriedly dragged him
down the aisle and took refuge back of the brick altar. The
bullets, now piercing the walls of the church with ease, whizzed
about them. One struck the pendant figure of the Christ, and
it fell crashing to the floor. Rosendo stood in horror, as if he
expected a miracle to follow this act of sacrilege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; prayed Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;only Thy hand can save us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will save us, Padre&ndash;&ndash;He will!&rdquo; cried Carmen, creeping
closer to him through the darkness. &ldquo;God is everywhere, and
right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said Don Jorge hurriedly, &ldquo;the Host&ndash;&ndash;is it on the
altar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;why?&rdquo; replied the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when the doors fall, do you stand in front of the
altar, holding it aloft and calling on the people to stand back,
lest the hand of God strike them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; hesitated not. &ldquo;It is a chance&ndash;&ndash;yes, a bare chance.
They will stop before it&ndash;&ndash;or they will kill me! But I will do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre! You shall not&ndash;&ndash;Padre! Then I shall stand with
you!&rdquo; Carmen&rsquo;s voice broke clear and piercing through the
din. Jos&egrave; struggled to free himself from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre,&rdquo; interposed Rosendo, &ldquo;it may be better so! Let
her stand with you! But&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>! Make haste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clamor without increased. Heavy poles and billets of
wood had been fetched, and blow after blow now fell upon
every shutter and door. The sharp spitting of the rifles tore
the air, and bullets crashed through the walls and windows.
In the heavy shadows back of the altar Rosendo and Don
Jorge crouched over the sobbing women. L&aacute;zaro lay very still.
Jos&egrave; knew as he stretched out a hand through the darkness
and touched the cold face that the faithful spirit had fled.
How soon his own would follow he knew not, nor cared. Keeping
close to the floor, he crept out and around to the front of
the altar. Reaching up, he grasped the Sacred Host, and then
stood upright, holding it out before him. Carmen rose by his
side and took his hand. Together in the gloom they waited.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 33</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Padre! Padre! are you alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo&rsquo;s hoarse whisper drifted across the silence
like a wraith. He crept out and along the floor, scarce
daring to look up. Through the darkness his straining eyes
caught the outlines of the two figures standing like statues
before the altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Loado sea Dios!</i>&rdquo; he cried, and his voice broke with a sob.
&ldquo;But, Padre, they have stopped&ndash;&ndash;what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not, <i>amigo</i>. Be patient. We are in the hands of
God&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;listen!&rdquo; Carmen darted from the altar and ran to
the door. &ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; she called back. &ldquo;Come! Some one is
speaking English!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; and Rosendo hurried to the door. All was quiet without,
but for an animated conversation between Don Mario and
some strangers who had evidently just arrived upon the scene.
One of the latter was speaking with the Alcalde in excellent
Spanish. Another, evidently unacquainted with the language,
made frequent interruptions in the English tongue. Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s
heart beat wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Reed,&rdquo; said the voice in English, &ldquo;tell the parchment-faced
old buzzard that we appreciate the little comedy he has
staged for us. Tell him it is bully-bueno, but he must not
overdo it. We are plum done up, and want a few days of rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What says the se&ntilde;or, <i>amigo</i>?&rdquo; asked Don Mario, with his
utmost suavity and unction of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; returned the other in Spanish, &ldquo;that he is delighted
with the firmness which you display in the administration
of your office, and that he trusts the bandits within the
church may be speedily executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bandits!&rdquo; ejaculated Don Mario. &ldquo;Just so, <i>amigo</i>! They
are those who defy the Government as represented by myself!&rdquo;
He straightened up and threw out his chest with such an exhibition
of importance that the strangers with difficulty kept
their faces straight.</p>
<p>Carmen and Jos&egrave; looked at each other in amazement during
this colloquy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Do all who speak English
tell such lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured the one addressed as Reed, directing himself
to the Alcalde, &ldquo;how dared they! But, se&ntilde;or, my friend
and I have come to your beautiful city on business of the utmost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page315' name='book2_page315'></a>315</span>
importance, in which you doubtless will share largely.
I would suggest,&rdquo; looking with amusement at the array of
armed men about him, &ldquo;that your prisoners are in no immediate
likelihood of escaping, and you might leave them under
close guard while we discuss our business. A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;we hear reports,
se&ntilde;or, that there is likely to be trouble in the country,
and we are desirous of getting out as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto! Cierto, se&ntilde;ores!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Don Mario, bowing
low. &ldquo;It shall be as you say.&rdquo; Turning to the gaping people,
he selected several to do guard duty, dismissed the others, and
then bade the strangers follow him to his house, which, he
declared vehemently, was theirs as long as they might honor
him with their distinguished presence.</p>
<p>The sudden turn of events left the little group within the
church in a maze of bewilderment. They drew together in the
center of the room and talked in low whispers until the sun
dropped behind the hills and night drifted through the quiet
streets. Late that evening came a tapping at the rear door of
the church, and a voice called softly to the priest. Jos&egrave; roused
out of his gloomy revery and hastened to answer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Fernando, Padre. I am on guard; but no one must
know that I talk with you. But&ndash;&ndash;Padre, if you open the door
and escape, I will not see you. I am sorry, Padre, but it could
not be helped. Don Mario has us all frightened, for the
Bishop&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; returned Jos&egrave;; &ldquo;but the strangers who arrived
this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;who are they, and whence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two <i>Americanos</i>, Padre, and miners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; studied a moment. &ldquo;Fernando&ndash;&ndash;you would aid me?
<i>Bien</i>, get word to the stranger who speaks both English and
Spanish. Bring him here, secretly, and stand guard yourself
while I talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly, Padre,&rdquo; returned the penitent fellow, as he
hastened quietly away.</p>
<p>An hour later Jos&egrave; was again roused by Fernando tapping
on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, Padre. Fear not; only the <i>Americano</i> will enter.
Don Mario does not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; lifted the prop and swung the door open. Rosendo
stood with uplifted <i>machete</i>. A man entered from the blackness
without. Jos&egrave; quickly closed the door, and then addressed
him in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger in a mellow voice.
&ldquo;I had no idea I should find any one in this God-forsaken town
who could speak real United States!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; drew him into the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i>. Neither man could see
the other in the dense blackness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page316' name='book2_page316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, friend,&rdquo; began Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;who you are, and where
you come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed&ndash;&ndash;Charles Reed&ndash;&ndash;New York&ndash;&ndash;mining engineer&ndash;&ndash;down
here to examine the so-called mines of the Molino Company,
now gasping its last while awaiting our report. Arrived this
afternoon from Badillo with my partner, fellow named Harris.
But&ndash;&ndash;great heavens, man! you certainly were in a stew when
we appeared! And why don&rsquo;t you escape now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape, friend? Where? Even if we passed the guard,
where would we go? There are two women, a girl, and a babe
with us. We have little food and no money. Should we gain
the Boque or Guamoc&oacute; trail, we would be pursued and shot
down. There is a chance here&ndash;&ndash;none in flight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; continued Jos&egrave; earnestly, &ldquo;will you
get word from me to the Bishop in Cartagena that our church
has been attacked&ndash;&ndash;that its priest is besieged by the Alcalde,
and his life in jeopardy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly&ndash;&ndash;but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have money?&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;Good.
Your <i>bogas</i> have not returned to Badillo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are staying here for the big show. Execution of
the traitors, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, friend, send them at dawn to Bodega Central. Let
them take a message to be sent by the telegraph from that
place. Tell the Bishop&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;Leave it to me. I&rsquo;ll fix up
a message that will bring him by return boat! I&rsquo;ve been talking
with the Honorable Alcalde and I&rsquo;ve got his exact number.
Say, he certainly is the biggest damn&ndash;&ndash;beg pardon; I mean,
the biggest numbskull I have ever run across&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;s saying
considerable for a mining man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, friend!&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, making no other reply to the man&rsquo;s
words. &ldquo;Go quickly&ndash;&ndash;and use what influence you have with
the Alcalde to save us. We have women here&ndash;&ndash;and a young
girl!&rdquo; He found the American&rsquo;s hand and led him out into the
night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Wenceslas Ortiz stood before the Departmental Governor.
His face was deeply serious, and his demeanor expressed the
utmost gravity. In his hand he held a despatch. The Governor
sat at his desk, nervously fumbling a pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, Se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; said Wenceslas quietly, &ldquo;do you act&ndash;&ndash;or
shall I take it to His Excellency, the President?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor moved uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo; he
blurted out. &ldquo;The report is too meager! And yet, I cannot
see but that the Alcalde acted wholly within his rights!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page317' name='book2_page317'></a>317</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Your Excellency, he seizes government arms&ndash;&ndash;he attacks
the church&ndash;&ndash;he attempts to destroy the life of its priest. Nominally
acting for the Government; at heart, anticlerical. Is it not
evident? Will the Government clear itself now of the suspicion
which this has aroused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the priest&ndash;&ndash;did you not say only last week that he
himself had published a book violently anticlerical in tone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, we will not discuss the matter further,&rdquo; said Wenceslas,
moving toward the door. &ldquo;Your final decision&ndash;&ndash;you
will send troops to Simit&iacute;, or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! The evidence warrants no interference
from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas courteously bowed himself out. Once beyond
the door, he breathed a great sigh of relief. &ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen!</i>&rdquo;
he muttered, &ldquo;but I took a chance! Had he yielded and sent
troops, all would have been spoiled. Now for Bogot&aacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered his carriage and was driven hurriedly to his
<i>sanctum</i>. There he despatched a long message to the President
of the Republic. At noon he had a reply. He mused over it
for the space of an hour. Then he framed another despatch.
&ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; it read, &ldquo;the Church supports the Administration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that evening a second message from Bogot&aacute; was put
into his hand. He tore it open and read, &ldquo;The Hercules ordered
to Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed, sinking into his chair. &ldquo;At last! The
President interferes! And now a wire to Ames. And&ndash;&ndash;<i>Caramba</i>,
yes! A message to the captain of the Hercules to
bring me that girl!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Well, old man, I&rsquo;ve done all I could to stave off the blundering
idiot; but I guess you are in for it! The jig is up, I&rsquo;m
thinking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Reed talking. Simit&iacute; again slept, while the American
and Jos&egrave; in the <i>sacrist&iacute;a</i> talked long and earnestly. Fernando
kept guard at the door. The other prisoners lay wrapped in
slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your message went down the river two days ago,&rdquo; continued
Reed. &ldquo;And, believe me! since then I&rsquo;ve racked my
dusty brain for topics to keep the Alcalde occupied and forgetful
of you. But I&rsquo;m dryer than a desert now; and he vows
that to-morrow you and your friends will be dragged out of
this old shack by your necks, and then shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two days had been filled with exquisite torture for Jos&egrave;.
Only the presence of Carmen restrained him from rushing out
and ending it all. Her faith had been his constant marvel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page318' name='book2_page318'></a>318</span>
Every hour, every moment, she knew only the immanence of
her God; whereas he, obedient to the undulating Rinc&oacute;n character-curve,
expressed the mutability of his faith in hourly
alternations of optimism and black despair. After periods of
exalted hope, stimulated by the girl&rsquo;s sublime confidence, there
would come the inevitable backward rush of all the chilling
fear, despondency, and false thought which he had just expelled
in vain, and he would be left again floundering helplessly
in the dismal labyrinth of terrifying doubts.</p>
<p>The quiet which enwrapped them during these days of imprisonment;
the gloom-shrouded church; the awed hush that
lay upon them in the presence of the dead L&aacute;zaro, stimulated
the feeble and sensitive spirit of the priest to an unwonted
degree of introspection, and he sat for hours gazing blankly
into the ghastly emptiness of his past.</p>
<p>He saw how at the first, when Carmen entered his life with
the stimulus of her buoyant faith, there had seemed to follow
an emptying of self, a quick clearing of his mentality, and a
replacement of much of the morbid thought, which clung
limpet-like to his mentality, by new and wonderfully illuminating
ideas. For a while he had seemed to be on the road to
salvation; he felt that he had touched the robe of the Christ,
and heavenly virtue had entered into his being.</p>
<p>But then the shadows began to gather once more. He did
not cling to the new truths and spiritual ideas tenaciously
enough to work them out in demonstration. He had proved
shallow soil, whereon the seed had fallen, only to be choked
by the weeds which grew apace therein. The troubles which
clustered thick about him after his first few months in Simit&iacute;
had seemed to hamper his freer limbs, and check his upward
progress. Constant conflict with Diego, with Don Mario, and
Wenceslas; the pressure from his mother and his uncle, had
kept him looking, now at evil, now at good, giving life and
power to each in turn, and wrestling incessantly with the false
concepts which his own mentality kept ever alive. Worrying
himself free from one set of human beliefs, he fell again into the
meshes of others. Though he thought he knew the truth&ndash;&ndash;though
he saw it lived and demonstrated by Carmen&ndash;&ndash;he had
yet been afraid to throw himself unreservedly upon his convictions.
And so he daily paid the dire penalty which error failed
not to exact.</p>
<p>But Carmen, the object of by far the greater part of all his
anxious thought, had moved as if in response to a beckoning
hand that remained invisible to him. Each day she had grown
more beautiful. And each day, too, she had seemed to draw
farther away from him, as she rose steadily out of the limited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page319' name='book2_page319'></a>319</span>
encompassment in which they dwelt. Not by conscious design
did she appear to separate from him, but inevitably, because of
his own narrow capacity for true spiritual intercourse with
such a soul as hers. He shared her ideals; he had sought in
his way to attain them; he had striven, too, to comprehend her
spirit, which in his heart he knew to be a bright reflection of
the infinite Spirit which is God. But as the years passed he
had found his efforts to be like her more and more clumsy and
blundering, and his responses to her spiritual demands less and
less vigorous. At times he seemed to catch glimpses of her
soul that awed him. At others he would feel himself half inclined
to share the people&rsquo;s belief that she was possessed of
powers occult. And then he would sink into despair of ever
understanding the girl&ndash;&ndash;for he knew that to do so he must be
like her, even as to understand God we must become like Him.</p>
<p>After her fourteenth birthday Jos&egrave; found himself rapidly
ceasing to regard Carmen as a mere child. Not that she did
not still often seem delightfully immature, when her spirits
would flow wildly, and she would draw him into the frolics
which had yielded her such extravagant joy in former days;
but that the growth of knowledge and the rapid development of
her thought had seemed to bring to her a deepening sense of
responsibility, a growing impression of maturity, and an increasing
regard for the meaning of life and her part in it. She
had ceased to insist that she would never leave Simit&iacute;. And
Jos&egrave; often thought of late, as he watched her, that he detected
signs of irksomeness at the limitations which her environment
imposed upon her. But, if so, these were never openly expressed;
nor did her manner ever change toward her foster-parents,
or toward the simple and uncomprehending folk of
her native town.</p>
<p>From the first, Jos&egrave; had constituted himself her teacher,
guide, and protector. And she had joyously accepted him.
His soured and rebellious nature had been no barrier to her
great love, which had twined about his heart like ivy around a
crumbling tower. And his love for the child had swelled like a
torrent, fed hourly by countless uncharted streams. He had
watched over her like a father; he had rejoiced to see her
bloom into a beauty as rich and luxuriant as the tropical
foliage; he had gazed for hours into the unsearchable abyss of
her black eyes and read there, in ecstasy, a wondrous response
to his love; and when, but a few short days ago, she had again
intimated a future union, a union upon which, even as a child,
she had insisted, yet one which he knew&ndash;&ndash;had always known&ndash;&ndash;utterly,
extravagantly impossible&ndash;&ndash;he had, nevertheless, seized
upon the thought with a joy that was passionate, desperate&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page320' name='book2_page320'></a>320</span>
had then flung it from him with a cry of agony. It was
not the disparity of ages; it was not the girl&rsquo;s present immaturity.
In less than a year she would have attained the marriageable
age of these Latin countries. But he could wait two,
three, aye, ten years for such a divine gift! No; the shadow
which lay upon his life was cast by the huge presence of the
master whose chains he wore, the iron links of which, galling
his soul, he knew to be unbreakable. And, as he sat in the
gloom of the decayed old church where he was now a prisoner,
the thought that his situation but symbolized an imprisonment
in bonds eternal roused him to a half-frenzied resolve to destroy
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; the girl had whispered to him that night,
just before the American came again with his disquieting report,
&ldquo;Love will open the door&ndash;&ndash;Love will set us free. We are
not afraid. Remember, Paul thanked God for freedom even
while he sat in chains. And I am just as thankful as he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; knew as he kissed her tenderly and bade her go to her
place of rest on the bench beside Do&ntilde;a Maria that death stood
between her and the stained hand of Wenceslas Ortiz.</p>
<p>As morning reddened in the eastern sky Don Mario, surrounded
by an armed guard and preceded by his secretary,
who beat lustily upon a small drum, marched pompously down
the main street and across the <i>plaza</i> to the church. Holding his
cane aloft he ascended the steps of the platform and again
loudly demanded the surrender of the prisoners within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what terms, Don Mario?&rdquo; asked Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; reiterated the Alcalde vigorously.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sighed. &ldquo;Then we will die, Don Mario,&rdquo; he replied
sadly, moving away from the door and leading his little band
of harried followers to the rear of the altar.</p>
<p>The Alcalde quickly descended the steps and shouted numerous
orders. Several of his men hurried off in various directions,
while those remaining at once opened fire upon the
church. In a few moments the firing was increased, and the
entire attack was concentrated upon the front doors.</p>
<p>The din without became horrible. Shouts and curses filled
the morning air. But it was evident to Jos&egrave; that his besiegers
were meeting with no opposition from his own supporters in
the fight of two days before. The sight of the deadly rifles in
the hands of Don Mario&rsquo;s party had quickly quenched their
loyalty to Jos&egrave;, and led them basely to abandon him and his
companions to their fate.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of vigorous assault the attack abruptly
ceased, and Jos&egrave; was called again to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Reed,&rdquo; came the American&rsquo;s voice. He spoke in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page321' name='book2_page321'></a>321</span>
English. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve persuaded the old carrion to let me have a
moment&rsquo;s pow-wow with you. Say, give the old buzzard what
he wants. Otherwise it&rsquo;s sure death for you all. I&rsquo;ve argued
myself sick with him, but he&rsquo;s as set as concrete. I&rsquo;ll do what
I can for you if you come out; but he&rsquo;s going to have the girl,
whether or no. Seems that the Bishop of Cartagena wants
her; and the old crow here is playing politics with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old man,&rdquo; chimed in another voice, which Jos&egrave; knew
to be that of Harris. &ldquo;You know these fellows are hell on
politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Harris!&rdquo; growled Reed. Then to Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll
I tell the old duffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Harry!&rdquo; ejaculated Harris, &ldquo;if I had a couple of
Mausers I could put these ancient Springfields on the bum in
a hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, friend, that we are prepared to die,&rdquo; replied
Jos&egrave; drearily, as he turned back into the gloom and took Carmen&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>The final assault began, and Jos&egrave; knew that it was only a
question of minutes when the trembling doors would fall. He
crouched with his companions behind the altar, awaiting the
inevitable. Carmen held his hand tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love will save us, Padre,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Love them!
Love them, Padre! They don&rsquo;t know what is using them&ndash;&ndash;and
it has no power! God is here&ndash;&ndash;is everywhere! Love will save
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo bent over and whispered to Don Jorge, &ldquo;When
the doors fall and the men rush in, stand you here with me!
When they reach the altar we will throw ourselves upon them,
I first, you following, while Juan will bring Carmen and try
to protect her. With our <i>machetes</i> we will cut our way out.
If we find that it is hopeless&ndash;&ndash;then give me Carmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, as with a loud wail, the two front doors
burst asunder and fell crashing to the floor. A flood of golden
sunlight poured into the dark room. In its yellow wake rushed
the mob, with exultant yells. Rosendo rose quickly and placed
himself at the head of his little band.</p>
<p>But, ere the first of the frenzied besiegers had crossed the
threshold of the church, a loud cry arose in the <i>plaza</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soldiers! <i>Dios arriba</i>! The soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the main thoroughfare came a volley of shots. Don
Mario, half way through the church door, froze in his tracks.
Those of his followers who had entered, turned quickly and
made pellmell for the exit. Their startled gaze met a company
of federal troops rushing down the street, firing as they
came. Don Mario strained after his flying wits.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page322' name='book2_page322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Close the doors!&rdquo; he yelled. But the doors were prone
upon the floor, and could not be replaced. Then he and his
men scrambled out and rushed around to one side of the building.
As the soldiers came running up, the Alcalde&rsquo;s followers
fired point blank into their faces, then dropped their guns and
fled precipitately.</p>
<p>It was all over in a trice. Within an hour staid old Simit&iacute;
lay in the grip of martial law, with its once overweening Alcalde,
now a meek and frightened prisoner, arraigned before
Captain Morales, holding court in the shabby town hall.</p>
<p>But the court-martial was wholly perfunctory. Though
none there but himself knew it, the captain had come with the
disposal of the unfortunate Don Mario prearranged. A perfunctory
hearing of witnesses, which but increased his approval
of his orders, and he pronounced sentence upon the former
Alcalde, and closed the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attack upon the church&ndash;&ndash;Assassination of the man L&aacute;zaro&ndash;&ndash;Firing
upon federal soldiers&ndash;&ndash;To be shot at sunset, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he concluded solemnly.</p>
<p>Don Mario sank to the floor in terror. &ldquo;<i>Caramba! caramba</i>!&rdquo;
he howled. &ldquo;But I had letters from the Bishop! I was ordered
by him to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied the captain, whose heart was not
wholly devoid of pity, &ldquo;produce your letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dios arriba</i>! I burned them! He said I should! I obeyed
him! <i>Caramba</i>! I am lost&ndash;&ndash;lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Capit&aacute;n</i>,&rdquo; interposed Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;may I plead for the man?
He is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Padre,&rdquo; returned the captain, holding up a hand,
&ldquo;it is useless. Doubtless this has been brought about by motives
which you do not understand. It is unfortunate&ndash;&ndash;but inevitable.
You have a <i>c&aacute;rcel</i> here? <i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; addressing his lieutenant, &ldquo;remove
the prisoner to it, and at sunset let the sentence be carried
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario, screaming with fear, was dragged from the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; continued the captain calmly, as if
nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, &ldquo;I appoint Don Fernando,
former secretary, as temporary Alcalde, until such time
as the Governor may fill the office permanently. And,&rdquo; he continued,
looking about the room with a heavy scowl, while the
timid people shrank against the wall, &ldquo;as for those misguided
ones who took part with Don Mario in this anticlerical uprising&ndash;&ndash;his
fate will serve, I think, as a warning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hush of horror lay upon the stunned people as they filed
slowly out of the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page323' name='book2_page323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; added the captain, addressing Fernando, &ldquo;quarters
for my men, and rations. We return to the Hercules at daybreak.
And let all arms and ammunition be collected. Every
house must be searched. And we shall want <i>peones</i> to carry
it to the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned away, sick with the horror of it all. A soldier
approached him with a message from Don Mario. The condemned
man was asking for the last rites. Faint and trembling,
the priest accompanied the messenger to the jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre! <i>Dios arriba</i>!&rdquo; wailed the terrified and bewildered
Don Mario. &ldquo;It was a mistake! Don Wenceslas&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand, Don Mario,&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave;, tenderly
taking the man&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;He told you to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Padre,&rdquo; sobbed the unfortunate victim. &ldquo;He said that
I would be rich&ndash;&ndash;that I would be elected to Congress&ndash;&ndash;ah, the
traitor! And, Padre&ndash;&ndash;I burned his letters because it was his
wish! Ah, <i>Santa Virgen</i>!&rdquo; He put his head on the priest&rsquo;s
shoulder and wept violently.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart was wrung; but he was powerless to aid the
man. And yet, as he dwelt momentarily on his own sorrows,
he almost envied the fate which had overtaken the misguided
Don Mario.</p>
<p>The lieutenant entered. &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the sun is
low. In a quarter of an hour&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario sank to the ground and clasped the priest&rsquo;s knees.
Jos&egrave; held up his hand, and the lieutenant, bowing courteously,
withdrew. The priest knelt beside the cowering prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Mario,&rdquo; he said gently, holding the man&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;confess
all to me. It may be the means of saving other lives&ndash;&ndash;and
then you will have expiated your own crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; moaned the stricken man, rocking back and forth,
his head buried in his hands and tears streaming through his
fingers, &ldquo;Padre, you will forgive&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Don Mario, everything. And the Christ forgives.
Your sins are remitted. But remove now the last burden from
your soul&ndash;&ndash;the guilty knowledge of the part Don Wenceslas has
had in the disaster which has come upon Simit&iacute;. Tell it all,
friend, for you may save many precious lives thereby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fallen Alcalde roused himself by a mighty effort. Forgetting
for the moment his own dire predicament, he opened
his heart. Jos&egrave; sat before him in wide-mouthed astonishment.
Don Mario&rsquo;s confession brought a revelation that left him cold.
The lieutenant entered again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;. Then, to Don Mario: &ldquo;And Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Mario leaned close to the priest and whispered low.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page324' name='book2_page324'></a>324</span>
&ldquo;No, she is not Diego&rsquo;s child! And, Padre, take her away, at
once! But out of the country! There is not an inch of ground
in all Colombia now where she would be safe from Don Wenceslas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast. Then he again took Don
Mario&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;rest assured, what you have told
me saves at least one life, and removes the sin with which your
own was stained. And now,&rdquo; rising and turning to the waiting
lieutenant, &ldquo;we are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ora pro nobis! Ora pro nobis! Santa Virgen, San Salvador,
ora pro nobis!</i></p>
<p>A few minutes later a sharp report echoed through the
Simit&iacute; valley and startled the herons that were seeking their
night&rsquo;s rest on the wooded isle. Then Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, alone,
and with a heart of lead, moved slowly down through the dreary
village and crossed the deserted <i>plaza</i> to his lowly abode.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_34' id='CHAPTER_34'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 34</h2>
</div>
<p>The low-hung moon, shrouded in heavy vapor, threw an
eldritch shimmer upon the little group that silently bore
the body of the martyred L&aacute;zaro from the old church late
that night to the dreary cemetery on the hill. Jos&egrave; took but a
reluctant part in the proceedings. He would even have avoided
this last service to his faithful friend if he could. It seemed
to him as he stumbled along the stony road behind the body
which Rosendo and Don Jorge carried that his human endurance
had been strained so far beyond the elastic limit that there
could now be no rebound. Every thought that touched his sore
mind made it bleed anew, for every thought that he accepted
was acrid, rasping, oppressive. The sheer weight of foreboding,
of wild apprehension, of paralyzing fear, crushed him, until his
shoulders bent low as he walked. How, lest he perform a miracle,
could he hope to extricate himself and his loved ones from
the meshes of the net, far-cast, but with unerring aim, which
had fallen upon them?</p>
<p>As he passed the town hall he saw through the open door
the captain&rsquo;s cot, and a guard standing motionless beside it.
The captain had elected to remain there for the night, while
his men found a prickly hospitality among the cowering townsfolk.
Jos&egrave; knew now that the hand which Don Mario had
dealt himself in the game inaugurated by Wenceslas had been
from a stacked deck. He knew that the President of the Republic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page325' name='book2_page325'></a>325</span>
had ordered Morales to this inoffensive little town to
quell an alleged anticlerical uprising, and that the execution
of the misguided Alcalde had been determined long before the
Hercules had got under way. He could see that it was necessary
for the Government to sacrifice its agent in the person of the
Alcalde, in order to prove its own loyalty to the Church. And
in return therefor he knew it would expect, not without reason,
the co&ouml;peration of the Church in case the President&rsquo;s interference
in the province of Bol&iacute;var should precipitate a general
revolt.</p>
<p>But what had been determined upon as his own fate? He
had not the semblance of an idea. From the confession of the
ruined Alcalde he now knew that Don Mario had been poisoned
against him from the beginning; that even the letters of introduction
which Wenceslas had given him to the Alcalde contained
the charge of his having accomplished the ruin of the
girl Maria in Cartagena, and of his previous incarceration in
the monastery of Palazzola. And Don Mario had confessed in
his last moments that Wenceslas had sought to work through
him and Jos&egrave; in the hope that the location of the famous mine,
La Libertad, might be revealed. Don Mario had been instructed
to get what he could out of this scion of Rinc&oacute;n; and only his
own greed and cupidity had caused him to play fast and loose
with both sides until, falling before the allurements which Wenceslas
held out, he had rushed madly into his own destruction.
Jos&egrave; realized that so far he himself had proved extremely useful
to Wenceslas&ndash;&ndash;but had his usefulness ended? At these thoughts
his soul momentarily suffused with the pride of the old and
hectoring Rinc&oacute;n stock and rose, instinct with revolt&ndash;&ndash;but only
to sink again in helpless resignation, while the shadow of despair
rolled in and quenched his feeble determination.</p>
<p>Rosendo and Don Jorge placed the body in one of the vacant
vaults and filled the entrance with some loose bricks. Then
they stood back expectantly. It was now the priest&rsquo;s turn. He
had a part to perform, out there on the bleak hilltop in the
ghostly light. But Jos&egrave; remained motionless and silent, his
head sunk upon his breast.</p>
<p>Then Rosendo, waxing troubled, spoke in gentle admonition.
&ldquo;He would expect it, you know, Padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned away from the lonely vault. Bitter tears coursed
down his cheeks, and his voice broke. He laid his head on
Rosendo&rsquo;s stalwart shoulder and wept aloud.</p>
<p>The sickly, greenish cast of the moonlight silhouetted the
figures of the three men in grotesque shapes against the cemetery
wall and the crumbling tombs. The morose call of a
toucan floated weirdly upon the heavy air. The faint wail of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page326' name='book2_page326'></a>326</span>
the frogs in the shallow waters below rose like the despairing
sighs of lost souls.</p>
<p>Rosendo wound his long arm about the sorrowing priest.
Don Jorge&rsquo;s muscles knotted, and a muttered imprecation rose
from his tight lips. Strangely had the shift and coil of the
human mind thrown together these three men, so different in
character, yet standing now in united protest against the misery
which men heap upon their fellow-men in the name of Christ.
Jos&egrave;, the apostate agent of Holy Church, his hands bound, and
his heart bursting with yearning toward his fellow-men; Rosendo,
simple-minded and faithful, chained to the Church by
heredity and association, yet ashamed of its abuses and lusts;
Don Jorge, fierce in his denunciation of the political and religious
sham and hypocrisy which he saw masking behind the
cloak of imperial religion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, friends,&rdquo; moaned Jos&egrave;, raising his
head; &ldquo;nothing that would not still further reveal my own
miserable weakness and the despicable falsity of the Church.
If the Church had followed the Christ, it would have taught me
to do likewise; and I should now call to L&aacute;zaro and bid him
come forth, instead of shamefully confessing my impotency and
utter lack of spirituality, even while I pose as an <i>Alter Christus</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you will leave a blessing with him before we go,
Padre?&rdquo; queried the anxious Rosendo, clinging still to the
frayed edge of his fathers&rsquo; faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My blessing, Rosendo,&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave; sadly, &ldquo;would do no
good. He lies there because we have utterly forgotten what
the Master came to teach. He lies there because of our false,
undemonstrable, mortal beliefs. Oh, that the Church, instead
of wasting time murmuring futile prayers over dead bodies,
had striven to learn to do the deeds which the Christ said we
should all do if we but kept his commandments!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, you will say Masses for him?&rdquo; pursued Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Masses? No, I can not&ndash;&ndash;now. I would not take his or
your money to give to the Church to get his soul out of an
imagined purgatory which the Church long ago invented for
the purpose of enriching herself materially&ndash;&ndash;for, alas! after
spiritual riches she has had little hankering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To pay God to get His own children out of the flames,
eh?&rdquo; suggested Don Jorge. &ldquo;It is what I have always said, the
religion of the Church is a <i>religion de dinero</i>. If there ever was
a God, either He is still laughing Himself sick at our follies&ndash;&ndash;or
else He has wept Himself to death over them! Jesus Christ
taught no such stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave; solemnly, turning to Don Jorge, &ldquo;I long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page327' name='book2_page327'></a>327</span>
since learned what the whole world must learn some time, that
the Church stands to-day, not as the bride of the Christ, but as
the incarnation of the human mind, as error opposed to Truth.
It is the embodiment of &lsquo;Who shall be greatest?&rsquo; It is one of
the various phenomena of the human mentality; and its adherents
are the victims of authoritative falsehood. Its Mass
and countless other ceremonies differ in no essential respect
from ancient pagan worship. Of spirituality it has none. And
so it can do none of the works of the Master. Its corrupting
faith is foully materialistic. It has been weighed and found
wanting. And as the human mind expands, the incoming light
must drive out the black beliefs and deeds of Holy Church, else
the oncoming centuries will have no place for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; ejaculated Don Jorge. &ldquo;But why do you
still remain a priest? <i>Hombre</i>! I knew when I saw you on
the river boat that you were none. But,&rdquo; his voice dropping to
a whisper, &ldquo;there is a soldier in the road below. It would be
well to leave. He might think we were here to plot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the soldier had passed, they quietly left the gloomy
cemetery and made their way quickly back through the straggling
moonlight to Rosendo&rsquo;s house. Do&ntilde;a Maria, with characteristic
quietude, was preparing for the duties of the approaching
day. Carmen lay asleep. Jos&egrave; went to her bedside
and bent over her, wondering. What were the events of the
past few days in her sight? How did she interpret them? Was
her faith still unshaken? What did L&aacute;zaro&rsquo;s death and the
execution of Don Mario mean to her? Did she, as he had done,
look upon them as real events in a real world, created and
governed by a good God? Or did she still hold such things to
be the unreal phenomena of the human mentality?&ndash;&ndash;unreal,
because opposed to God, and without the infinite principle. As
for himself, how had the current of his life been diverted by
this rare child! What had she not sought to teach him by her
simple faith, her unshaken trust in the immanence of good!
True, as a pure reflection of good she had seemed to be the
means of stirring up tremendous evil. But had he not seen
the evil eventually consume itself, leaving her unscathed? And
yet, would this continue? He himself had always conceded to
the forces of evil as great power as to those of good&ndash;&ndash;nay, even
greater. And even now as he stood looking at her, wrapped in
peaceful slumber, his strained sight caught no gleam of hope,
no light flashing through the heavy clouds of misfortune that
lowered above her. He turned away with an anxious sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; said the gentle Do&ntilde;a Maria, &ldquo;the two <i>Americanos</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Jos&egrave;, suddenly remembering that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page328' name='book2_page328'></a>328</span>
had sent word to them to use his house while they remained
in the town. &ldquo;They had escaped my thought. <i>Bien</i>, they
are&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They brought their baggage to your house an hour ago
and set up their beds in your living room. They will be asleep
by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he replied, a wistful sense of gratitude stealing over
him at the reassuring thought of their presence. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, we will
not disturb them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summoning Rosendo and Don Jorge, the three men sought
the lake&rsquo;s edge. There, seated on the loose shales, they wrestled
with their problem until dawn spread her filmy veil over the
shimmering stars.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Long before sun-up the soldiers and the <i>peones</i>, whom Captain
Morales had impressed, were busy gathering the commandeered
rifles and carrying them down to the gunboat Hercules,
waiting at the mouth of the Boque river, some six or
eight miles distant, and over a wild trail. The townsfolk,
thoroughly frightened, hugged the shelter of their homes, and
left the streets to the troops. Though they detested the soldiers,
yet none would lightly risk a blow from the heavy hand
of Morales, whose authority on a punitive expedition of this
sort was unlimited. The summary execution of the Alcalde
had stricken them with horror, and left an impression which
never would be erased from their memories.</p>
<p>Immediately after the early <i>desayuno</i> the captain appeared
at Rosendo&rsquo;s door. He had come to say farewell to the priest.
All of the soldiers had disappeared down the trail, with the
exception of the two who formed the captain&rsquo;s small personal
escort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Conque, adios, Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>&rdquo; he called cheerily, as he approached.
Jos&egrave; was sitting at table with Rosendo&rsquo;s family and
Don Jorge. Instinctively he rose hastily, and seizing Carmen,
thrust her into the adjoining bedroom and closed the door.
Then he went out to face the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much excitement for your little <i>pueblo</i>, no?&rdquo; exclaimed the
captain with a bluff laugh as he grasped Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;But a
lesson like this will last a century. I rejoice that I found it
unnecessary to burn the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; trembled as he replied. &ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or Capit&aacute;n</i>, I, too, rejoice.
But&ndash;&ndash;the state of the country&ndash;&ndash;what may we expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain laughed again. &ldquo;<i>Caramba, Padre m&iacute;o</i>! who
can say? There is much talk, many angry looks, much gesturing
and waving of hands. Congress still sits. The President
sees fit to send me here, without order from the Departmental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page329' name='book2_page329'></a>329</span>
Governor. <i>Hombre</i>! what will follow? <i>Quien sabe</i>?&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders with that expressive Latin gesture which
indicates complete irresponsibility for and indifference to results.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart began to beat more regularly. He again took
the captain&rsquo;s hand. He was eager to see him depart. &ldquo;<i>Bueno
pues, Se&ntilde;or Capit&aacute;n</i>,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;I wish you every
felicitation on your return trip. Ah&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;your orders contained
no reference to&ndash;&ndash;to me?&rdquo; he added hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, <i>Se&ntilde;or Padre</i>,&rdquo; replied the captain genially.
He turned to go, and Jos&egrave; stifled a great sigh of relief. But
suddenly the captain stopped; then turned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;I nearly forgot! <i>Hombre</i>! what
would His Grace have said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fumbled in an inner pocket and drew forth a telegraphic
document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And you will seize the person of one Rosendo Ariza&rsquo;s
daughter and immediately send her with proper conveyance to
the Sister Superior of the convent of Our Lady in Cartagena</i>,&rdquo;
he read aloud.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; froze to the spot. From within Rosendo&rsquo;s house came
a soft, scurrying sound. Then he heard a movement in his
own. Morales returned the folded message to his pocket and
started to enter the house. Jos&egrave; could offer no resistance. He
was rendered suddenly inert, although vividly conscious of a
drama about to be enacted in which he and his loved ones
would play leading <i>r&ocirc;les</i>. As in a dream he heard the captain
address Rosendo and gruffly demand that he produce his daughter.
He heard a deep curse from Rosendo; and his blood congealed
more thickly as he dwelt momentarily on the old man&rsquo;s
possible conduct in the face of the federal demand. He heard
Morales hunting impatiently through the shabby rooms. Then
he saw him emerge in a towering rage&ndash;&ndash;but empty-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, Padre!&rdquo; cried the angry captain, &ldquo;but what is
this? Have they not had one good lesson, that I must inflict
another? I demand to know, has this Rosendo Ariza a daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood waiting for the answer that Jos&egrave; knew he must
make. The priest&rsquo;s hollow voice sounded like an echo from
another world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, then I have discovered one honest man in yourself,
Padre. You will now assist me in finding her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I know not&ndash;&ndash;where&ndash;&ndash;where she is, <i>Se&ntilde;or Capit&aacute;n</i>,&rdquo;
murmured Jos&egrave; with feebly fluttering lips.</p>
<p>They were alone, this little party of actors, although many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page330' name='book2_page330'></a>330</span>
an eye peered out timidly at them from behind closed shutters
and barred doors around the <i>plaza</i>. Don Jorge and Rosendo
came out of the house and stood behind Jos&egrave;. The captain
confronted them, bristling with wrath at the insolence that
dared oppose his supreme authority. The heat had already begun
to pour down in torrents. The morning air was light, but
not a sound traversed it. The principals in this tense drama
might have been painted against that vivid tropical background.</p>
<p>Then Harris, moved by his piquant Yankee curiosity, appeared
at the door of the parish house, his great eyes protruding
and his head craned forth like a monster heron. Morales
saw him. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Perhaps the <i>Americano</i> hides
the daughter of Ariza!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started for the priest&rsquo;s door. But ere he reached it
Reed suddenly appeared from behind Harris. In his hand he
grasped a large American flag. Holding this high above his
head, he blocked the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold! <i>Se&ntilde;or Capit&aacute;n</i>!&rdquo; he cried in his perfect Spanish.
&ldquo;We are American citizens, and this house is under the protection
of the American Government!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morales fell back and stood with mouth agape in astonishment.
The audacity of this foreign adventurer fairly robbed
him of his breath. He glanced dubiously from him to the
priest. Then, to save the situation, he broke into an embarrassed
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, my good friend,&rdquo; he finally said, addressing Reed in
his courtliest manner, &ldquo;all respect to your excellent Government.
And, if you will accept it, I shall be pleased to secure
you a commission in the Colombian army. But, my orders&ndash;&ndash;you
understand, do you not? The sun is already high, and I
can not lose more time. Therefore, you will kindly stand aside
and permit me to search that house.&rdquo; He motioned to his men
and moved forward.</p>
<p>Still holding aloft the flag, Reed drew a long revolver. Harris
quickly produced one of equal size and wicked appearance.
Morales stopped abruptly and looked at them in hesitation. He
knew what he might expect. He had heard much of American
bravery. His chief delight when not in the field was the perusal
of a battered history of the American Civil War; and his exclamations
of admiration for the hardihood of those who participated
in it were always loud and frequent. But he, too, had
a reputation to sustain. The Americans stood grimly silent before
him. Harris&rsquo;s finger twitched nervously along the trigger,
and a smile played over his thin lips. The man was aching for
a scrimmage.</p>
<p>Then, his face flaming with shame and chagrin, Morales
turned to his escort and commanded them to advance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page331' name='book2_page331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>Up went the two revolvers. A moment more, and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A cry came from Rosendo&rsquo;s house. Ana, her face swollen
with weeping, clasping her sightless babe to her bosom, had
emerged and faced the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said in a voice strained to a whisper, &ldquo;I am
the daughter of Rosendo Ariza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half-suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of Rosendo.
A desperate, suffocating joy surged over the riven soul
of the priest. Don Jorge&rsquo;s mouth opened, but no sound came
forth. This precipitate <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> held them rigid with astonishment.</p>
<p>A heavy silence descended upon them all. In the eyes of
Jos&egrave; Ana&rsquo;s tense figure, standing grim and rigid before the
captain, took on a dignity that was majestic, a worth that transcended
all human computation. A Magdalen, yes, standing
with her sin-conceived child clasped in her trembling arms.
But this act&ndash;&ndash;God above! this sacrificial act broke the alabaster
box and spread the precious nard over the feet of the pitying
Christ.</p>
<p>Morales turned questioningly to Jos&egrave;. &ldquo;Is this true, Padre?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; murmured the dazed priest, scarce hearing his own
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;I have no orders respecting a child&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot be separated,&rdquo; half whispered Jos&egrave;, not daring
to meet the vacant gaze of the babe.</p>
<p>The captain hesitated a moment longer. Then, with an
upward glance at the sun, he gave a sharp command to his
men. Placing the woman between them, the two soldiers faced
about and moved quickly away. With a low bow and a final
&ldquo;<i>Adios, Se&ntilde;ores</i>,&rdquo; the captain hurriedly joined them. Ere the
little group before Rosendo&rsquo;s house had collected their wits, the
soldiers and their frail charge had mounted the hill beyond the
old church and disappeared into the matted trail that led from
it to the distant river.</p>
<p>Rosendo was the first to break the mesmeric silence. &ldquo;<i>Dios
arriba</i>!&rdquo; he cried. His knees gave way beneath him and he
buried his face in his hands. &ldquo;Anita&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he rose hastily, and made as if to pursue the soldiers.
Jos&egrave; and Don Jorge restrained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>!&rdquo; cried Don Jorge, &ldquo;but it is the hand of Providence!
It is better so! Listen, friend Rosendo, it but gives us
time to act! Perhaps many days! When the mistake is discovered
they will return, and they will bring her back unharmed&ndash;&ndash;though
they may not learn until she reaches Cartagena!
<i>Bien</i>, we can not waste time in mourning now!
Courage, man! Think&ndash;&ndash;think hard!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page332' name='book2_page332'></a>332</span></div>
<p>Rosendo strove to unravel his tangled wits. Jos&egrave; went to
him and clasped his big hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;friend&ndash;&ndash;would you have it different? I&ndash;&ndash;I alone
am to blame that they took Anita! But&ndash;&ndash;it was to save&ndash;&ndash;to
save&ndash;&ndash;Ah, God! if I did wrong, take the American&rsquo;s revolver
and shoot me!&rdquo; He tore open his cassock and stood rigid before
the dazed man. Anguish and soul-torture had warped his
features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>! Enough of such talk!&rdquo; cried Don Jorge impatiently.
&ldquo;We shall find plenty of others more deserving of
shooting, I think! The girl&ndash;&ndash;where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed turned back into the parish house, and emerged a
moment later with Carmen and Do&ntilde;a Maria, who knew not
as yet of Ana&rsquo;s departure. &ldquo;I hid them in your bedroom,
Padre,&rdquo; Reed explained.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; threw him a look of gratitude. &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Maria,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;do you take Carmen into your house and await our decision!
And you, men, go into my study! It is as Don Jorge says, we
must act quickly! Leave your flag hanging, Mr. Reed! It may
serve to protect us further against the angry people of Simit&iacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five men quickly gathered in Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s living room in a
strained, excited group. The priest was the first to speak.
Rapidly he related in detail Don Mario&rsquo;s last confession. When
he had closed, Reed made reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; he said, familiarly addressing Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;having
seen the girl, I do not at all wonder that blood has been shed
over her. But to keep her another hour in Simit&iacute; is to sacrifice
her. Get her away&ndash;&ndash;and at once! If not, the people will drive
you out. I talked with Fernando last night. With the soldiers
gone, the people will rise up against you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, friend, where shall we go?&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave; in desperation.
&ldquo;There is no place in Colombia now where she would be safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave the country,&rdquo; suggested Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can not be done,&rdquo; interposed Don Jorge. &ldquo;It would be
impossible for him to escape down the river with the girl, even
if he had funds to carry her away from Colombia, which he
has not. At any port he would be seized. To take the trail
would only postpone for a short time their certain capture.
And then&ndash;&ndash;well, we will not predict! To flee into the jungle&ndash;&ndash;or
to hide among the <i>peones</i> along the trails&ndash;&ndash;that might be
done&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the gibberish about now, pal?&rdquo; put in Harris, whose
knowledge of the Spanish tongue was <i>nil</i>.</p>
<p>Reed explained to him at some length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; returned Harris. &ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em you&rsquo;ll take
the girl out yourself. She&rsquo;s white enough to pass as your
daughter, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page333' name='book2_page333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>Rosendo, stunned by the sudden departure of Ana, had sat
in a state of stupefaction during this conversation. But now
he roused up and turned to Reed. &ldquo;What says he, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; he
inquired thickly.</p>
<p>The latter translated his friend&rsquo;s suggestion, laughing as
he commented on its gross absurdity.</p>
<p>Rosendo dropped his head again upon his chest and lapsed
into silence. Then he rose unsteadily and passed a hand slowly
across his brow. A strange light had come into his eyes. For
a moment he stood looking fixedly at Reed. Finally he began
to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; he said, rolling his syllables sonorously, &ldquo;the
time has come at last! For years I have waited, waited, knowing
that some day the great gift which the good God put into
my hands for the little Carmen would be needed. Se&ntilde;ores, my
parents were slaves. The cruel Spaniards drove them to and
from their heavy labors with the lash; and when the great
war ended, they sank exhausted into their graves. My parents&ndash;&ndash;I
have not told you this, Padre&ndash;&ndash;were the slaves of Don
Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exclamation burst from the astonished priest&rsquo;s lips.
What, then, had this man been concealing all these years?
Little wonder that he had hesitated when he learned that a
Rinc&oacute;n had come to the parish of Simit&iacute;!</p>
<p>The old man quickly resumed. As he continued, his recital
became dramatic. As they listened, his auditors sat spellbound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n himself was kind of heart. But his
overseers&ndash;&ndash;ah, <i>Dios arriba</i>! they were cruel! cruel! Many a
time the great lash wound itself about my poor father&rsquo;s shrinking
body, and hurled him shrieking to the ground&ndash;&ndash;and why?
Because his blistered hands could not hold the <i>batea</i> with which
he washed gold for your grandfather, Padre, your grandfather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast. A groan escaped him,
and tears trickled slowly down his sunken cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bear you no malice, Padre,&rdquo; continued Rosendo. &ldquo;It was
hard those first days to accept you here. But when, during
your fever, I learned from your own lips what you had suffered,
I knew that you needed a friend, and I took you to my bosom.
And now I am glad&ndash;&ndash;ah, very glad, that I did so. But, though
my confidence in you increased day by day, I could never bring
myself to tell you my great secret&ndash;&ndash;the secret that now I reveal
for the sake of the little Carmen. Padre&ndash;&ndash;se&ntilde;ores&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;<i>I am
the owner of the great mine, La Libertad</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the heavens collapsed the astonishment of Don Jorge
and the priest could not have been greater. The coming of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page334' name='book2_page334'></a>334</span>
soldiers, the terrific strain of the past few days, culminating in
the loss of Ana&ndash;&ndash;all was for the moment obliterated.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; started up and tried to speak. But the words would
not come. Rosendo paused a moment for the effect which he
knew his revelation would produce, and then went on rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, the mine belonged to your grandfather. It produced
untold wealth. The gold taken from it was brought down the
Guamoc&oacute; trail to Simit&iacute;, and from here shipped to Cartagena,
where he lived in great elegance. I make no doubt the gold
which you and the little Carmen discovered in the old church
that day came from this same wonderful mine. But the ore
was quartz, and <i>arrastras</i> were required to grind it, and much
skill was needed, too. He had men from old Spain, deeply
versed in such knowledge. Ah, the tales my poor father told
of that mine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, the war broke out. The Guamoc&oacute; region became depopulated,
and sank back into the jungle. The location of the
mine had been recorded in Cartagena; but, as you know, when
Don Ignacio fled from this country he destroyed the record.
He did the same with the records in Simit&iacute;, on that last flying
trip here, when he hid the gold in the altar of the old church.
And then the jungle grew up around the mine during those
thirteen long years of warfare&ndash;&ndash;the people who knew of it died
off&ndash;&ndash;and the mine was lost, utterly lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for breath. The little group sat enthralled before
him. All but Harris, who was vainly beseeching Reed to
translate to him the dramatic story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; continued Rosendo at length, &ldquo;from what my
father had told me I had a vague idea of the location of that
mine. And many a weary day I spent hunting for it! Then&ndash;&ndash;then
I found it! Ah, <i>Caramba</i>! I wept aloud for joy! It was
while I was on the Tigu&iacute;, washing gold. I was working near
what we used to call <i>Pozo Cayman</i>, opposite La Colorado,
where the Frenchmen died. I camped on the lonely bank there,
with only the birds and the wondering animals to keep me
company. One dark night, as I lay on the ground, I had a
dream. I believe in dreams, Padre. I dreamt that the Virgin,
all in white, came to me where I lay&ndash;&ndash;that she whispered to me
and told me to rise quickly and drive away the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I awoke suddenly. It was still dark, but a pair of fiery
eyes were gleaming at me from the bush. I seized my <i>machete</i>
and started after them. It was a jaguar, Padre, and he fled up
the hill from me. Why I followed, I know not, unless I thought,
still half asleep as I was, that I was obeying the Virgin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the top of the hill I lost the animal&ndash;&ndash;and myself, as
well. I am a good woodsman, se&ntilde;ores, and not easily lost. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page335' name='book2_page335'></a>335</span>
this time my poor head went badly astray. I started to cut
through the bush. At last I came to the edge of a steep ravine.
I clambered down the sides into the gully below. I thought it
looked like an old trail, and I followed it. So narrow was it at
times that the walls almost touched. But I went on. Then it
widened, and I knew that at last I was in a trail, long since
abandoned&ndash;&ndash;and how old, only the good God himself knew!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my story grows as long as the trail! On and on I
went, crossing stream after stream, scaring snakes from my
path, frightening the birds above, who doubtless have never
seen men in that region, all the time thinking I was going
toward the Tigu&iacute;, until at last the old sunken trail led me up a
tremendous hill. At the top, buried in a dense matting of
brush, I fell over a circle of stones. They were the remains of
an ancient <i>arrastra</i>. Further on I found another; and still
another. Then, near them, the stone foundations of houses,
long since gone to decay. From these the trail took me into a
gully, where but little water flowed. It was lined with quartz
bowlders. I struck off a piece from one of the largest. It
showed specks of gold! My eyes danced! I forgot that I was
lost! I went on up the stream, striking off piece after piece
from the great rocks. Every one showed specks of free gold.
<i>Caramba</i>! I reached the top of the hill. <i>Hombre</i>! how can I
tell it! Tunnel after tunnel yawned at me from the hillside.
Some of these were still open, where they had been driven
through the hard rock. Others had caved. I had my wallet,
in which I always carry matches and a bit of candle. I entered
one of the open tunnels. <i>Dios arriba</i>! far within I crossed a
quartz vein&ndash;&ndash;I scraped it with my <i>machete</i>. <i>Caramba</i>! it could
not have been less than six feet in width&ndash;&ndash;and all speckled with
gold! Above it, far into the blackness, where bats were scurrying
madly, the ore had been taken out long, long ago. In the
darkness below I stumbled over old, rusted tools. Every one
bore the inscription, &lsquo;I de R.&rsquo; Your grandfather, Padre, put his
stamp on everything belonging to him. Then, as I sat trying to
place myself, my father&rsquo;s oft-told story of the location of the
mine flashed into my brain. My memory is good, Padre. And I
knew then where I was. I was at the headwaters of the Borrachera.
<i>And I had discovered La Libertad</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed&rsquo;s eager ears had drunk in every word of the old
man&rsquo;s dramatic story. His practical mind had revolved its
possibilities. When Rosendo paused again, he quickly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo drew forth a paper from his bosom. It bore the
government stamp. He handed it to Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will recall, Padre,&rdquo; he said, addressing the dully wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page336' name='book2_page336'></a>336</span>
Jos&egrave;, &ldquo;that I once asked you to give me a name for a
mine&ndash;&ndash;a rare name? And you told me to call it the&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chicago mine, Rosendo?&rdquo; replied Jos&egrave;, recalling the
incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man excitedly, &ldquo;that is it! <i>Bien</i>,
I told no one of my discovery of years before. I had never
had money enough to get the title to it. Besides, I was afraid.
But when it seemed that I might soon have use for it I sold my
<i>finca</i> for funds and had L&aacute;zaro apply through Don Mario for
title to a mine called&ndash;&ndash;called&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chicago mine,&rdquo; said Jos&egrave;, again coming to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so! <i>Bien</i>, L&aacute;zaro got the title, which I never could
have done, for at that time Don Mario would not have put
through any papers for me. I then had the unsuspecting
L&aacute;zaro transfer the title to me, and&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>, I am the sole owner
of La Libertad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed examined the paper at some length, and then handed
it back to Rosendo. &ldquo;Can we not talk business, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo; he
said, speaking with some agitation. &ldquo;I am so situated that I
can float an American company to operate this mine, and
allow you a large percentage of the returns. Great heavens!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, unable longer to contain himself, &ldquo;it is your
fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Rosendo, slowly shaking his head, &ldquo;I want
no share in any of your American companies. But&ndash;&ndash;your
friend&ndash;&ndash;he has suggested just what has been running through
my mind ever since you came to Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s heart suddenly stopped. The wild, terrifying idea
tore through his fraught brain. He turned quickly to Reed
and addressed him in English. &ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;it is impossible! The
old man wanders! You can not take the girl&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; ejaculated Reed with some warmth. &ldquo;Such
a thing is quite out of the question!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; exclaimed Harris. &ldquo;Now look here, Mr. Priest,
Reed&rsquo;s wife is in Cartagena, waiting for him. Came down
from New York that far for the trip. Kind of sickly, you
know. What&rsquo;s to prevent her from taking the girl to the
States and placing her in a boarding school there until such
time as you can either follow, or this stew down here has
settled sufficiently to permit of her returning to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed threw up a deprecatory hand. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposed Harris exasperatedly, &ldquo;would you leave
the ravishing little beauty here to fall into the hands of the
cannibals who are trailing her? Lord Harry! if it weren&rsquo;t for
the looks of the thing I&rsquo;d take her myself. But you&rsquo;ve got a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page337' name='book2_page337'></a>337</span>
wife, so it&rsquo;d be easy.&rdquo; He leaned over to Reed and concluded
in a whisper, &ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s going to make a proposition&ndash;&ndash;listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; remonstrated the latter, &ldquo;the expense of keeping her
in New York indefinitely! For, unless I mistake much, none
of these people will ever see the States after she leaves. And
then I have an adopted daughter on my hands! And, heaven
knows! now that my ambitious wife is determined to break
into New York society with her adorable sister, I have no
money to waste on adopted children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo, who had been studying the Americans attentively
during their conversation, now laid a hand on Reed&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he said in a quiet tone, &ldquo;if you will take the little Carmen with
you, and keep her safe from harm until Padre Jos&egrave; can come
to you, or she can be returned to us here, I will transfer to you
a half interest in this mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; sprang to his feet. His face was blanched with fear.
&ldquo;Rosendo!&rdquo; he cried wildly, &ldquo;do not do that! <i>Dios arriba</i>, no!
You do not know this man! Ah, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; turning to Reed, &ldquo;I beg
you will forgive&ndash;&ndash;but Rosendo is mad to suggest such a thing!
We cannot permit it&ndash;&ndash;we&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;oh, God above!&rdquo; He sank again
into his chair and covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>Don Jorge gave vent to a long, low whistle. Rosendo, his
voice husky and his lips trembling, went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Padre&ndash;&ndash;I know. But it must be done! I will give
the mine to the American&ndash;&ndash;and to Carmen. He has a powerful
government back of him, and he is able to defend the title and
save her interest as well as his own. As for me, I&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
I shall want nothing when Carmen goes&ndash;&ndash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; burst in Harris, seizing Reed&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t tell me what all this is about now I shall shoot&ndash;&ndash;and
not straight up, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; said Reed in a controlled voice, &ldquo;let me talk
this matter over with my friend here. I will come to you in an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo and Don Jorge bowed and silently withdrew from
the parish house. The former went at once to apprise the
wondering Do&ntilde;a Maria of the events which had crowded the
morning&rsquo;s early hours and to answer her apprehensive questionings
regarding Ana. Carmen was to know only that Ana&ndash;&ndash;but
what could he tell her? That the woman had sacrificed
herself for the girl? No; but that they had seized this opportunity
to send her, under the protection of Captain Morales, to
the Sisters of the Convent of Our Lady. The old man knew that
the girl would see only God&rsquo;s hand in the event.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; as in a dream sought Carmen. It seemed to him that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page338' name='book2_page338'></a>338</span>
once his arms closed about her no power under the skies could
tear them asunder. He found her sitting in the doorway at
the rear of Rosendo&rsquo;s house, looking dreamily out over the
placid lake. Cucumbra, now old and feeble, slept at her feet.
As the man approached he heard her murmur repeatedly, &ldquo;It
is not true&ndash;&ndash;it is not true&ndash;&ndash;it is not true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; cried Jos&egrave;, seizing her hand. &ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose quickly. &ldquo;Gladly, Padre&ndash;&ndash;but where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God only knows&ndash;&ndash;to the end of the world!&rdquo; cried the
frenzied man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre dear,&rdquo; she softly replied, as she smiled up
into his drawn face, &ldquo;we will start out. But I think we had
better rest when we reach the shales, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she put her hand in his.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_35' id='CHAPTER_35'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 35</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre dear,&rdquo; with an energetic shake of her head, &ldquo;no.
Not even after all that has seemed to happen to us do I
believe it true. No, I do not believe it real. Evil is not
power. It does not exist, excepting in the human mind. And
that, as you yourself know, can not be real, for it is all that God
is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were seated beneath the slowly withering <i>algarroba</i>
tree out on the burning shales. Jos&egrave; still held the girl&rsquo;s hand
tightly in his. Again he was struggling with self, struggling
to pass the borderline from, self-consciousness to God-consciousness;
striving, under the spiritual influence of this girl, to
break the mesmeric hold of his own mortal beliefs, and swing
freely out into his true orbit about the central Sun, infinite
Mind.</p>
<p>The young girl, burgeoning into a marvelous womanhood,
sat before him like an embodied spirit. Her beauty of soul
shone out in gorgeous luxuriance, and seemed to him to envelop
her in a sheen of radiance. The brilliant sunshine glanced
sparkling from her glossy hair into a nimbus of light about her
head. Her rich complexion was but faintly suggestive to him
of a Latin origin. Her oval face and regular features might
have indicated any of the ruddier branches of the so-called
Aryan stock. But his thought was not dwelling on these things
now. It was brooding over the events of the past few weeks,
and their probable consequences. And this he had just voiced
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she had said, when his tremulous voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page339' name='book2_page339'></a>339</span>
ceased, &ldquo;how much longer will you believe that two and two
are seven? And how much longer will you try to make me believe
it? Oh, Padre, at first you did seem to see so clearly, and
you talked so beautifully to me! And then, when things seemed
to go wrong, you went right back to your old thoughts and
opened the door and let them all in again. And so things
couldn&rsquo;t help getting worse for you. You told me yourself, long
ago, that you would have to empty your mind of its old beliefs.
But I guess you didn&rsquo;t get them all out. If you had cleaned
house and got your mind ready for the good thoughts, they
would have come in. You know, you have to get ready for the
good, before it can come. You have to be receptive. But you
go right on getting ready for evil. If you loved God&ndash;&ndash;really
<i>loved</i> Him&ndash;&ndash;why, you would not be worried and anxious to-day,
and you would not be believing still that two and two are
seven. You told me, oh, so long ago! that this human life was
just a <i>sense</i> of life, a series of states of consciousness, and that
consciousness was only mental activity, the activity of thought.
Well, I remembered that, and put it into practice&ndash;&ndash;but you
didn&rsquo;t. A true consciousness is the activity of true thought,
you said. A false consciousness is the activity of false thought.
True thought comes from God, who is mind. False thought
is the opposite of true thought, and doesn&rsquo;t come from any
mind at all, but is just supposition. A supposition is never
really created, because it is never real&ndash;&ndash;never truth. True
thought becomes externalized to us in good, in harmony, in
happiness. False thought becomes externalized to us in unhappiness,
sickness, loss, in wrong-doing, and in death. It is
unreal, and yet awfully real to those who believe it to be real.
Why don&rsquo;t you act your knowledge, as you at first said you
were going to do? I have all along tried to do this. Whenever
thoughts come to me I always look carefully at them to see
whether they are based on any real principle, on God. If so, I
let them in. If not, I drive them away. Sometimes it has been
hard to tell just which were true and which false. And sometimes
I got caught, and had to pay the penalty. But every day
I do better; and the time will come at last when I shall be
able to tell at once which thoughts are true and which untrue.
When that time comes, nothing but good thoughts will enter,
and nothing but good will be externalized to me in consciousness.
I shall be in heaven&ndash;&ndash;all the heaven there is. It is the
heaven which Jesus talked so much about, and which he said
was within us all. It is so simple, Padre dear, so simple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sat humbly before her like a rebuked child. He
knew that she spoke truth. Indeed, these were the very things
that he had taught her himself. Why, then, had he failed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page340' name='book2_page340'></a>340</span>
demonstrate them? Only because he had attempted to mix
error with truth&ndash;&ndash;had clung to the reality and immanence of
evil, even while striving to believe good omnipotent and infinite.
He had worked out these theories, and they had appeared
beautiful to him. But, while Carmen had eagerly
grasped and assimilated them, even to the consistent shaping
of her daily life to accord with them, he had gone on putting
the stamp of genuineness and reality upon every sort of thought
and upon every human event as it had been enacted in his
conscious experience. His difficulty was that, having proclaimed
the allness of spirit, God, he had proceeded to bow
the knee to evil. Carmen had seemed to know that the mortal,
material concepts of humanity would dissolve in the light of
truth. He, on the other hand, had clung to them, even though
they seared the mind that held them, and became externalized
in utter wretchedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you let God&rsquo;s thoughts in, Padre, and drive out
their opposites, then sickness and unhappiness will disappear,
just as the mist disappears over the lake when the sun rises
and the light goes through it. If you really expected to some
day see the now &lsquo;unseen things&rsquo; of God, you would get ready
for them, and you would &lsquo;rejoice always,&rsquo; even though you did
seem to see the wickedness of Padre Diego, the coming of the
soldiers, the death of L&aacute;zaro and Don Mario, and lots of unhappiness
about yourself and me. Those men are not dead&ndash;&ndash;except
to your thought. You ought to know that all these
things are the unreal thoughts externalized in your consciousness.
And, knowing them for what they really are, the
opposites of God&rsquo;s thoughts, you ought to know that they can
have no more power over you than anything else that you know
to be supposition. We can suppose that two and two are seven,
but we can&rsquo;t make it true. The supposition does not have any
effect upon us. We know that it isn&rsquo;t so. But as regards just
thought&ndash;&ndash;and you yourself said that everything reduces to
thought&ndash;&ndash;why, people seem to think it is different. But it
isn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t you understand what the good man Jesus meant
when he told the Pharisees to first cleanse the cup and platter
within, that the outside might also be clean? Why, that was a
clear case of externalization, if there ever was one! Cleanse
your thought, and everything outside of you will then become
clean, for your clean thought will become externalized. You
once said that you believed in the theory that &lsquo;like attracts
like.&rsquo; I do, too. I believe that good thoughts attract good ones,
and evil thoughts attract thoughts like themselves. I have
proved it. And you ought to know that your life shows it, too.
You hold fear-thoughts and worry-thoughts, and then, just as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page341' name='book2_page341'></a>341</span>
soon as these become externalized to you as misfortune and
unhappiness, you say that evil is real and powerful, and that
God permits it to exist. Yes, God does permit all the existence
there is to a supposition&ndash;&ndash;which is none. You pity yourself
and all the world for being unhappy, when all you need is to
do as Jesus told you, and know God to be infinite Mind, and
evil to be only the suppositional opposite, without reality, without
life, without power&ndash;&ndash;unless you give it these things in your
own consciousness. You don&rsquo;t have to take thought for your
life. You don&rsquo;t have to be covetous, or envious, or fearful, or
anxious. You couldn&rsquo;t do anything if you were. These things
don&rsquo;t help you. Jesus said that of himself he could do nothing.
But&ndash;&ndash;as soon as he recognized God as the infinite principle of
all, and acted that knowledge&ndash;&ndash;why, then he raised the dead!
And at last, when his understanding was greater, he dissolved
the mental concept which people called his human body. Don&rsquo;t
you see it, Padre&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you? I <i>know</i> you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he saw it. He always did when she pleaded thus. And
yet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Carmen, padre Rosendo would send you out of the
country with these Americans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so you have said. And you have said that you have
always feared you would lose me. Is that fear being externalized
now? I have not feared that I would lose you. But, Padre
dear&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghastly look on the man&rsquo;s face threw wide the flood-gates
of her sympathy. &ldquo;Padre&ndash;&ndash;all things work together for
good, you know. Good is <i>always</i> working. It never stops.
Listen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She clung more closely to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, it may be best, after all. You do not want me to
stay always in Simit&iacute;. And if I go, you will go with me, or
soon follow. Oh, Padre dear, you have told me that up in that
great country above us the people do not know God as you and
I are learning to know Him. Padre&ndash;&ndash;I want to go and tell
them about Him! I&rsquo;ve wanted to for a long, long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes shone with a holy light. Her wistful face
glowed with a love divine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, you have so often said that I had a message
for the world. Do not the people up north need that message?
Would you keep me here then? The people of Simit&iacute; are too
dull to hear the message now. But up there&ndash;&ndash;Oh, Padre, it
may be right that I should go! And, if it is right, nothing can
prevent it, for the right <i>will</i> be externalized! Right <i>will</i> prevail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>True, there was the girl&rsquo;s future. Such a spirit as hers
could not long be confined within the narrow verges of Simit&iacute;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page342' name='book2_page342'></a>342</span>
He must not oppose his egoism to her interests. And, besides,
he might follow soon. Perhaps go with her! Who
knew? it might be the opening of the way to the consummation
of that heart-longing for&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Ah, the desperate joy that surged through his yearning
soul at the thought! The girl was fifteen. A year, two, three,
and he would still be a young man! She loved him&ndash;&ndash;never had
man had such proofs as he of an affection so divine! And he
worshiped her! Why hesitate longer? Surely the way was
unfolding!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; he said tenderly, drawing her closer to him,
&ldquo;you may be right. Yes&ndash;&ndash;we will both go with the Americans.
Once out of this environment and free from ecclesiastical
chains, I shall do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up at him with brimming eyes. &ldquo;Padre
dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I want to go&ndash;&ndash;away from Simit&iacute;. Juan&ndash;&ndash;he
asks me almost every day to marry him. And he becomes
angry when I refuse. Even in the church, when Don Mario
was trying to get us, Juan said he would save me if I would
promise to marry him. He said he would go to Cartagena and
kill the Bishop. He follows me like a shadow. He&ndash;&ndash;Padre, he
is a good boy. I love him. But&ndash;&ndash;I do not&ndash;&ndash;want to marry
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat silent for some moments. Jos&egrave; knew how insistent
Juan had become. The lad adored the girl. He tormented the
priest about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you&ndash;&ndash;you are not always going to be a priest&ndash;&ndash;are
you? And&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;oh, Padre dear, I love you so!&rdquo; She turned
impulsively and threw both arms about his neck. &ldquo;I want to
see you work out your problem. I will help you. You can go
with me&ndash;&ndash;and I can always live with you&ndash;&ndash;and some day&ndash;&ndash;some
day&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She buried her face in his shoulder. The artless
girl had never seemed to think it unmaidenly to declare her
love for him, to show him unmistakably that she hoped to become
his wife.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s heart gave a mighty leap. The beautiful child
in his arms was human! Young in years, and yet a woman by
the conventions of these tropic lands. He bent his head and
kissed her. Why, she had long insisted that she would wait for
him! And why should he now oppose the externalization of
that sweet thought?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I will indeed go with you
now! I will send my resignation to the Bishop at once. No,
I will wait and send it from the States. I will renounce my
oath, abjure my promise&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat suddenly upright and looked earnestly into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page343' name='book2_page343'></a>343</span>
eyes. &ldquo;What do you mean, Padre?&rdquo; she queried dubiously.
&ldquo;What did you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have never told you. But&ndash;&ndash;I promised my mother,
dearest one, that I would always remain a priest&ndash;&ndash;unless,
indeed, the Church herself should eject me from the priesthood.
But, it was foolish&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother&ndash;&ndash;she expects you to keep your word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat in pensive silence for a moment. &ldquo;But, Padre,&rdquo;
she resumed, &ldquo;honesty&ndash;&ndash;it is the very first thing that God
requires of us. We have to be&ndash;&ndash;we <i>must</i> be honest, for He is
Truth. He cannot see or recognize error, you know. And so
He cannot see you and help you if you are dishonest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, child. And I tried to be honest, even when circumstances
and my own poor resistive force combined to direct
me into the priesthood. But&ndash;&ndash;since that day I have lived a
life of hypocrisy, not knowing how to shape my course. Then,
at length, I met you. It was&ndash;&ndash;too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Padre, the Church has not put you out? You are
still a priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sadly; &ldquo;and no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if you went to the States&ndash;&ndash;with me&ndash;&ndash;would you be
put out of the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would that mean, Padre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disgrace that always attaches to an apostate priest,
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre&ndash;&ndash;your mother&ndash;&ndash;what would she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; hung his head. &ldquo;It would kill her,&rdquo; he replied slowly.</p>
<p>Carmen reflected long, while Jos&egrave;, with ebbing hope, waited.
&ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she finally said, &ldquo;then you have not yet worked
out your problem&ndash;&ndash;have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he knew that. And he was now attempting to solve it
by flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, Padre, you have not worked it out in God&rsquo;s way.
For if you had, no one would be hurt, and there could not be
any disgrace, or unhappiness&ndash;&ndash;could there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; he cried in despair, &ldquo;nothing but excommunication
can release me! And I long ago ceased to look for
that. You do not understand&ndash;&ndash;you are young! What can I
do?&rdquo; His tortured soul pleaded in agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre dear, you can work it out, all out, in God&rsquo;s
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;must I remain here&ndash;&ndash;can I let you go alone with the
Americans&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can, if it is right,&rdquo; she answered gently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page344' name='book2_page344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; he cried, straining her in his arms. &ldquo;If you
go with the Americans, I shall, I must, go too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless it is right, Padre,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;If it is right,
nothing can keep you from going. But, unless it is God&rsquo;s way&ndash;&ndash;well,
you can not solve your problem by running away from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;child&ndash;&ndash;to remain here means&ndash;&ndash;God above! you don&rsquo;t
realize what it may mean to us both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl relapsed into silence. Jos&egrave; began to feel that they
were drifting hopelessly, abysmally apart. Desperation seized
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; he cried miserably. &ldquo;I have been cheated and
thwarted all my wretched life! I can endure it no longer! I
can not, would not, hold you here, if the way opens for you to
go! But&ndash;&ndash;I can not remain here without you&ndash;&ndash;and live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true, Padre,&rdquo; replied the girl, slowly shaking
her head. &ldquo;No human being is necessary to any one&rsquo;s happiness.
And progress always comes first. You are trying to
&lsquo;acquire that mind which was in Christ.&rsquo; If you are really
progressing, why, you will surely be happy. But you must
work it all out God&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His way!&rdquo; he retorted bitterly. &ldquo;And that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be honest, Padre, honest with Him and with
everybody. If you can no longer be a priest&ndash;&ndash;if you are not
one, and never have been one&ndash;&ndash;you must be honest with the
Church and with yourself. You must see and reflect only
Truth. Why do you not write to the Bishop and tell him all
about it? You say you have been protecting me. But leave me
to God. You must&ndash;&ndash;Padre, you <i>must</i>&ndash;&ndash;be honest! Write to
your mother&ndash;&ndash;write to the Bishop. Tell them both how you
feel. Then leave it all with God. Do not run away. Throw
yourself upon Him. But&ndash;&ndash;oh, Padre dear, you must trust Him,
and you must&ndash;&ndash;you <i>must</i>&ndash;&ndash;know that He is good, that He is
infinite, and that there is no evil! Otherwise, the good can not
be externalized. If you did that, your problem would be
quickly solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and took his hand. &ldquo;Padre dear,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;God is life&ndash;&ndash;there is no death. God is eternal&ndash;&ndash;there is no
age. God is all good&ndash;&ndash;there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.
God is infinite, and He is mind&ndash;&ndash;there is no inability to see the
right and to do it. God is my mind, my spirit, my soul, my
all. I have nothing to fear. Human mental concepts are not
real. You, yourself, say so. I am not afraid of them. I look
at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him. But He
is just as much to you as He is to me. You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only
work out in the right way. You <i>must</i> work as God directs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page345' name='book2_page345'></a>345</span>
Only by so doing can you solve your problem. I try always to
work that way. And I have always worked for you that way.
I have always thought the time would come when you and I
would live and work together&ndash;&ndash;always. But I have not insisted
on it. I have not said that it <i>had</i> to be. If it works out that
way, I know I would be very happy. But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the
good God is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me
all happiness. And now we must leave everything to Him,
while we work, work, work to see Him only everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would talk no more. Suffering himself to be led by
her, they crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made
their way silently through the burning heat into the village.</p>
<p>At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo. His face
was grave, but his manner calm. &ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;it is arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s knees shook under him as he followed the old man
into the house. Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the
table, on which were strewn papers covered with figures and
sketches. The priest sat down dumbly and drew Carmen to
him. Harris fell to devouring the girl with his bulging eyes.
Reed at once plunged into the topic under consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been saying,&rdquo; he began, addressing the priest, &ldquo;that
I can accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with
some amendments. Mr. Harris and I are under contract with
the Molino Company to report upon their properties along the
Boque river. I am informed by Don Rosendo that he is
acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless. Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.
But I will agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection
of my wife, upon the consideration that when I reach
my home city I be allowed to form a company to take over this
mine, returning to the girl a fifty-one per cent interest in the
stock, one half of which she agrees in writing to deliver to me
immediately upon its issuance. Being under contract, I can not
accept it now. The balance of the stock must be sold for development
purposes. I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or
effect her return to Colombia. Now, according to Ariza&rsquo;s
sketches, we may proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters&ndash;&ndash;how
far did you say, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some hundred and fifty miles from Simit&iacute;, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied
Rosendo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; resumed Reed, &ldquo;we can cut across country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page346' name='book2_page346'></a>346</span>
from the sources of the Boque, following what is known as
Rosario creek, down to the river Tigu&iacute;, striking the latter
somewhere near the ancient point known as La Colorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; interposed Rosendo, &ldquo;remember that the headwaters
of the Boque are practically unknown to-day. Many
years ago, when I was a small lad, some liberated slaves worked
along Rosario creek, which was then one day&rsquo;s journey on foot
with packs from La Colorado. But that old trail has long since
disappeared. Probably no one has been over it since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned the practical Reed, &ldquo;then we shall
have to make our own trail across the divide to the Tigu&iacute;. But
once at La Colorado, you tell me there is an ancient trail that
leads down to Llano, on the Nech&iacute; river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to the mouth of the Amacer&iacute;. Llano was something
of a town long ago. But river steamers that go up the Nech&iacute; as
far as Zaragoza once a month, or less frequently, still touch
there, I am told. And so you can get down the Cauca to Maganguey,
where you can change to a Magdalena river boat for
Calamar. Then by rail to Cartagena. The trail to Llano can
not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled
softly. &ldquo;Lord Harry!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;nearly two hundred
miles, and all by foot, over unspeakable jungle trails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed paid no attention to him. &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;we had best set out as soon as possible. To you, friend
Rosendo, I leave all arrangements regarding supplies and <i>cargadores</i>.
I will furnish funds for the entire expedition, expecting
to be reimbursed by La Libertad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen listened, with dilated eyes. As for Jos&egrave;, his head
swam. Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately
to inaugurate preparations, he drew him into the latter&rsquo;s house.
&ldquo;<i>Hombre</i>!&rdquo; he cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation,
&ldquo;do you know what you are doing? Do you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, Padre,&rdquo; replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, &ldquo;it is best. I want the <i>Americanos</i> to take
Carmen. She is not safe another day here. The soldiers left
but yesterday. They may return any hour. At any moment
an order might come for your arrest or mine. We must get
her away at once. We can do no more for her here. The
struggle has been long, and I weary of it.&rdquo; He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow. &ldquo;I weary of life,
Padre. I would be through with it. I am old. This world can
hold little more for me. If I can but know that she is safe&ndash;&ndash;<i>Bien</i>,
that is all. From what we have learned, this country will
soon be plunged again into war. I do not wish to live through
another revolution. I have seen many. I seem to have fought

all my life. And for what? What is La Libertad to me? Nothing&ndash;&ndash;less
than nothing. I have not the funds to work it. I
doubt if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the
title to such a famous mine. But the <i>Americano</i> can hold it.
And he is honest, Padre. He will save Carmen&rsquo;s interest, and
deal fairly with her. <i>Bien</i>, let him place her in a school in the
States. If you weather the oncoming revolution, then you may
be able to send for her. <i>Quien sabe</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; controlled himself. &ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will go
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him quizzically. &ldquo;Do you mean,
Padre, that you will leave the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; kept silent for some time. Then he spoke bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I remain longer in Simit&iacute;, where the people have become
divided&ndash;&ndash;where they look upon me askance, as the cause
of the trouble that has befallen them? Is not my usefulness
here ended? War is at our door. What, think you, will it
mean to Simit&iacute;? To us? And Wenceslas, what has he further
in store for you and me? What he has for Carmen, we well
know. And we seek by flight to save her. But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained. The trick which Anita
played upon Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased
wrath upon our heads, especially yours and mine. No, Rosendo,
you and I must go, and go at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Anita&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will pick her up in Cartagena. Don Jorge will accompany
us. I have certain information to give him that will
enlist his services&ndash;&ndash;information which, I think, will serve to
introduce him to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly. But,
come, Rosendo, do you and Do&ntilde;a Maria prepare for flight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria and I? The States! Na, Padre, it is impossible!
I will go with the <i>Americanos</i> up the Boque and to La Libertad.
Then I will return to Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;or to the <i>hacienda</i> of Don Nicol&aacute;s,
if Maria wishes to remain there while I am in the hills.
But&ndash;&ndash;do you go, Padre&ndash;&ndash;go and look after the girl. There is
nothing further for you here. Yes, Padre, go&ndash;&ndash;go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider? The Americans
will take us all for that mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? No, Padre,&rdquo; said the old man firmly, but in a voice
heavy with sadness. &ldquo;Maria and I remain in Simit&iacute;. My work
is done when I have seen the girl safely out of this unhappy
country. I could not live in the States. And my days are few
now, anyway. Let me end them here. How, I care not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo&rsquo;s arms.
&ldquo;Padre Rosendo!&rdquo; she cried, aglow with animation, &ldquo;we are
all going to the States up north! I am going to take them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page348' name='book2_page348'></a>348</span>
my message! And I am going to school there! Oh, padre,
isn&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>chiquita</i>,&rdquo; said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to
him, &ldquo;I guess we have decided to send you on ahead&ndash;&ndash;a little
ahead of us. Your old padre has some business he must attend
to here before he leaves.&rdquo; His eyes grew moist. Jos&egrave; knew
what his effort at cheerfulness was costing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, padre Rosendo, you will come&ndash;&ndash;later? You promise?
You must!&rdquo; She looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little one, yes&ndash;&ndash;of course. For where you are, there
your old padre will always be&ndash;&ndash;always&ndash;&ndash;always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Padre Jos&egrave;?&rdquo; panted the girl under Rosendo&rsquo;s tight
grasp as she turned her head toward the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes with us,&rdquo; assured Rosendo&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I think&ndash;&ndash;at least
as far as the coast. He will see Anita&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His voice
broke, and he turned abruptly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she will go to the States with us! Oh, padre!&rdquo; cried
the girl, bounding up and down with joy.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; turned and went quickly into his own house. With
grim determination he drew the battered haircloth trunk from
beneath his bed and began to throw his few effects into it.</p>
<p>But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud
title of official courier between Simit&iacute; and Bodega Central, entered
with a letter. Jos&egrave; recognized the writing, and tore it
open at once. It was from his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager
income, together with what little you have been able to send me from
time to time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle,
to enable me to visit you. I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey. And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that your
long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle informs
me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by poignant
suffering. Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my beloved son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter slipped from the priest&rsquo;s fingers and drifted to
the floor. With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his
face in his hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 36</h2>
</div>
<p>What had kept Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n chained all these years to
an institution to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy
he was so utterly alien, we have repeatedly
pointed out&ndash;&ndash;a warped sense of filial devotion, a devotion that
would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud, sensitive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page349' name='book2_page349'></a>349</span>
mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just that
which it strives to avoid. But yet he had somehow failed to
note the nice distinction which he was always making between
the promises he had given to her and the oath which he had
taken at his ordination. He had permitted himself to be held
to the Church by his mother&rsquo;s fond desires, despite the fact
that his nominal observance of these had wrecked his own
life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave. The
abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of
the sapient words of Jesus: &ldquo;For whosoever shall do the will
of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and
sister, and mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then had come Carmen. And he had sacrificed his new-found
life to the child. He had exhausted every expedient to
keep himself in Simit&iacute;, that he might transfer his own great
learning to this girl, and at the same time yield himself to her
beneficent influence. Yet, despite his vague hopes, he had
always dimly seen the day when she would leave him; but he
had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own status
would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her. Alas!
the lapse of years had brought little change in that respect.</p>
<p>But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of
departure which all his life in Simit&iacute; had hung like a menacing
cloud above him. And the shock had been such that he
had thrown every other consideration to the winds, and, regardless
of consequences, was madly preparing to accompany
her. Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come his mother&rsquo;s
letter.</p>
<p>He slept not that night. Indeed, for the past two nights
sleep had avoided his haggard eyes. In the feeble glow of his
candle he sat in his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far
into the hours of morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing&ndash;&ndash;and,
at last, yielding. If he had been born anew
that fateful day, seven years before, when Rosendo first told
him the girl&rsquo;s story, he had this night again died. When the
gray hours of dawn stole silently across the distant hills he
rose. His eyes were bleared and dull. His cheeks sunken.
He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans. Rosendo met him in front of
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest&rsquo;s
appearance.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; held up a warning hand. &ldquo;Do not speak of it, Rosendo.
I am not well. But not a word to Carmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo nodded understandingly. &ldquo;It has been hard on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page350' name='book2_page350'></a>350</span>
you, Padre. But you will soon be off now. And in the States
with her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, friend, never speak of that again!&rdquo; cried
Jos&egrave; sharply. &ldquo;Listen! How long will it take to complete
your preparations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered
his breath, &ldquo;we can get away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not go this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre. There is much to do. But you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, friend. Everything must be conducted in the
greatest secrecy. It must be given out that the Americans go
to explore the Boque; that you accompany them as guide;
that Carmen goes as&ndash;&ndash;as cook, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, she cooks as well as Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of
the real nature of your trip. He must not go with you. He
is the courier&ndash;&ndash;I will see that Fernando sends him again to
Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps him there for several
days. You say it is some two hundred miles to Llano. How
long will it take to go that distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;<i>Quien sabe</i>, Padre?&rdquo; returned Rosendo thoughtfully.
&ldquo;With a fair trail, and allowing the <i>Americanos</i> some
time to prospect on the Boque&ndash;&ndash;where they will find nothing&ndash;&ndash;and
several days to look over La Libertad, we ought to reach
Llano in six weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Cartagena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the
river bank for the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should
be out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. You and she&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, friend. I do not go with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? <i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the
<i>desayuno</i>. Tell Do&ntilde;a Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.
I am going up to the old church on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo stared stupidly at the priest. But Jos&egrave; turned
abruptly and started away, leaving the old man in a maze of
bewilderment.</p>
<p>In the gloom of the old church Jos&egrave; threw himself upon a
bench near the door, and waited torpidly. A few moments
later came a voice, and then the soft patter of bare feet in the
thick dust without. Carmen was talking as she approached.
Jos&egrave; rose in curiosity; but the girl was alone. In her hand
she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a desperate nourishment
from the barren soil at the roadside. She glanced up at
Jos&egrave; and smiled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page351' name='book2_page351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to understand their language, isn&rsquo;t it, Padre?
They don&rsquo;t speak as we do, but they reflect. And that is
better than speaking. They reflect God. They stand for His
ideas in the human mind. And so do you. And I. Aren&rsquo;t
they wonderful, these flowers! But you know, they are only
the way we interpret certain of God&rsquo;s wonderful ideas. Only,
because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t we? We
see only our thoughts, after all. Everything we see about us
is reflected thought. First we see our thoughts of life and
beauty and good. And then our thoughts of decay and death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But God&ndash;&ndash;He never sees anything but the good,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;He sees the real, not the supposition. And when we
learn to see only as He does, why, then we will never again
see death. We will see ourselves as we really are, immortal.
God sees Himself that way. Jesus learned to see that way,
didn&rsquo;t he? His thought was finally so pure that he saw nothing
but good. And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called
miracles. But they were only the things that you and I and
everybody else ought to be doing to-day&ndash;&ndash;and would be doing,
if we thought as he did, instead of thinking of evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she panted, as she sat down beside him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked
a lot, haven&rsquo;t I? And you sent for me because you wanted to
talk. But, remember,&rdquo; holding up an admonitory finger, &ldquo;I
shall not listen if you talk anything but good. Oh, Padre
dear,&rdquo; looking up wistfully into his drawn face, &ldquo;you are still
thinking that two and two are seven! Will you never again
think right? How can you ever expect to see good if you look
only at evil? If I looked only at wilted flowers I would never
know there were any others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; he said in a hollow voice, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course you do,&rdquo; returned the artless girl. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t help it. You have just <i>got</i> to love me and everything and
everybody. That&rsquo;s reflecting God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not meant to say that. But it had been floating like
foam on his tossing mind. He took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going away from me,&rdquo; he continued, almost in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Padre,&rdquo; she replied quickly; &ldquo;you are going
too! Padre Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not go,&rdquo; he said in a quavering voice. &ldquo;I remain, in
Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him wonderingly. What meant this
change which had come over him so suddenly? She drew
closer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page352' name='book2_page352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s face hovered before him in the dim light.
Behind her a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded
and beckoned significantly. Back of them, as they stood between
him and the girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.
It was his problem. He turned wearily from it to the gentle
presence at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre dear?&rdquo; came again the soft question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay&ndash;&ndash;to work out&ndash;&ndash;my problem,&rdquo; was his scarcely audible
reply.</p>
<p>The girl did not speak. But her breath came more quickly,
and her hand closed more tightly about his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest one,&rdquo; he murmured, bending over the brown
curls, &ldquo;it is God&rsquo;s way, I guess. Perhaps in the years which I
have spent here with you I have had the time and the opportunity
to work out my salvation. I am sure that I have. But,
though I strove in my way, I could not quickly acquire your
spirituality. I could not at once shake loose those poisonous
thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become externalized
in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life, you, my
beloved girl, you.&rdquo; He buried his face in her luxuriant hair and
strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all
that is good&ndash;&ndash;even from God,&rdquo; he continued in a choked voice.
&ldquo;Oh, my sweet girl, I love you as it seems to me no human
being could love another! It has been so from that first day
when, a mere babe, your wonderful eyes held me until I could
read in them a depth of love for mankind that was divine.&rdquo;
It did not seem to him that a mature man was speaking to a
mere girl. She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in wisdom
and experience.</p>
<p>Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.
He bent low and kissed her brow. Then he drew himself up
quickly and resumed his broken talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed at first that my salvation lay in you. And so
it did, for from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying
knowledge of the great principle, God. But alas! I could not
seem to realize that between recognizing righteousness as
&lsquo;right-thinking&rsquo; and daily practicing it so as to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; God
there was a great difference. And so I rested easy in my first
gleams of truth, expecting that they would so warm my soul
that it would expand of itself out of all error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made as if to reply, but he checked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here
to have enabled me to work out my salvation, even though
with fear and trembling. But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page353' name='book2_page353'></a>353</span>
still clung to effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew
were bound to manifest in unhappiness later. I was afraid
to boldly throw myself upon my thought. I was mesmerized.
Yes, the great Paul was at times under the same mesmeric
spell of human belief, even after he had seen the vision of the
Christ. But he worked his way steadily out. And now I see
that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual experience.
No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man. The principle is already given us. We must apply it
to our problems ourselves. My unfinished task&ndash;&ndash;scarcely even
begun!&ndash;&ndash;lies still before me. My environment is what I have
made it by my own thought. I believe you, that I can enter
another only as I externalize it through righteousness, right-thinking,
and &lsquo;proving&rsquo; God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so
quietly at his side. His throat filled. But he caught his
breath and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen
beyond me, and beyond this lowly encompassment. Why,
when you were a mere babe, you should have grasped your
padre Rosendo&rsquo;s casual statement that &lsquo;God is everywhere,&rsquo;
and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know. Nor
do you. That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of
God. But the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with
it as a light unto your feet you groped your way out of this
environment, avoiding all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day
you stand at the threshold of another and higher one. So progress
must ever be, I now realize. Up we must rise from one
plane of human mentality to another, sifting and sorting the
thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding those,
until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to accept
those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to reject
those that bear the stamp of supposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, &ldquo;I
have told you so often&ndash;&ndash;when a thought comes to me that I
think is not from God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on
it and kill it. You could do the same, if you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, child&ndash;&ndash;if I would!&rdquo; he replied in bitterness of
heart. &ldquo;So could all mankind. And then the millennium
would be with us, and the kingdom of heaven revealed. The
mesmeric belief in evil as an entity and a power opposed to
good alone prevents that. Destroy this belief, and the curtain
will instantly rise on eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully
into them. Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for
the moment seemed to be translated. Then a surge of fear-thoughts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page354' name='book2_page354'></a>354</span>
swept him, and left him dwelling on the hazardous
journey that awaited her. He wildly clutched her again to
his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen&ndash;&ndash;child&ndash;&ndash;how can I let you go! So young, so tender!
And that awful journey&ndash;&ndash;two hundred miles of unknown
jungle, to the far-off Nech&iacute;! And then the burning river, to
Cartagena, where&ndash;&ndash;where <i>he</i> is! And the States&ndash;&ndash;God, what
awaits you there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she answered softly, &ldquo;I shall not go unless it is
right. If it is right, then God will take care of me&ndash;&ndash;and of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she saw only the &ldquo;right-best&rdquo; thought, while he sat
trembling before its opposite. And the opposite was as yet a
supposition!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear, there is no separation, you know. God is
everywhere, and so there is no separation from good&ndash;&ndash;is
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in your thought, dearest child,&rdquo; he murmured
huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not? Can&rsquo;t you
live one day at a time? That is what Jesus taught us. You
are borrowing from to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.
That&rsquo;s stealing. God says, &lsquo;Thou shalt not steal,&rsquo; even from
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she was still at his side. Perhaps she would not go,
after all. He was borrowing, and borrowing supposition. The
thought seemed to lighten his load momentarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t suppose you have had any good thoughts at all about
Anita&rsquo;s little babe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The babe?&rdquo; in a tone of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know, it is not blind. You promised me that
every day you would just <i>know</i> that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rebuke smote him sore. Aye, his crowning sin was
revealed again in all its ugly nakedness. Egoism! His thought
was always of his own troubles, his own longings, his own
fears. Self-centeredness had left no room for thoughts of
Ana&rsquo;s blind babe. And why was he now straining this beautiful
girl to himself? Was it fear for her, or for himself? Yet
she gave but little heed to her own needs. Always her concern
was for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of
the human mind&rsquo;s false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and
ignorance of the allness of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, child,&rdquo; he exclaimed penitently, &ldquo;such love! How
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page355' name='book2_page355'></a>355</span>
could I dare to hope ever to claim it! How can you say that
you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Padre, I love the real &lsquo;you,&rsquo; the &lsquo;you&rsquo; that is going
to be brought out, and that will become more and more clear,
until at last it stands as the perfect reflection of God. Haven&rsquo;t
I told you that, time and time again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child. You love the ideal. But&ndash;&ndash;to live with me&ndash;&ndash;to
be my&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be
thinking that we were on earth. We have got to work out of
this human way of thinking and living. And it has seemed
to me that you and I could work out of it so much better together,
you helping me, manifesting God&rsquo;s protection and care,
and I helping you, as you say I can and do. And how can we
live together and work together unless we marry? Ages make
no difference! And time is only a human concept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt
for convention. It would be gratuitous. As for him, women
had never constituted a temptation. He knew that he loved
this simple, ingenuous girl with a tenderness of passion that
was wholly free from the dross of mesmerism. With that he
remained content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while,
to work out your problem, why, I shall just <i>know</i> that evil
can not separate us. I don&rsquo;t like to even seem to go away without
you. But&ndash;&ndash;it will be only seeming, after all, won&rsquo;t it?
God&rsquo;s children can not really be separated&ndash;&ndash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the
spiritual universe. And how her words comforted him! How
like a benison they flowed over his drooping spirits!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Padre dear,&rdquo; she said, rising from the bench,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;we
have done all we could&ndash;&ndash;left everything with God&ndash;&ndash;haven&rsquo;t
we? I must go now, for madre Maria told me to come back
soon. She needs me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;no, not yet! Wait&ndash;&ndash;Carmen! Sing for me&ndash;&ndash;just
once more! Sing again the sweet melody that I heard when
I awoke from the fever that day long ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her unresisting to his side. Nestling close against
him, her head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she
sang again the song that had seemed to lift him that distant
day far, far above the pitiful longings and strivings of poor
humanity, even unto the gates of the city of eternal harmony.</p>
<p>She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through
the musty room and died among the black rafters overhead. A
holy silence fell upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing
the future. Hot tears were streaming down the man&rsquo;s cheeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page356' name='book2_page356'></a>356</span>
They fell sparkling like drops of dew upon her brown curls.
But he made no complaint. The girl, obedient to the vision,
was reaping her reward. He, timid, wavering, doubting, was
left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment. It
was but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.
But did he imagine that out in the world she would not still
find tribulation, even as the Saviour had said? Aye, she
would, in abundance! But she leaned on her sustaining God.
Her Christ had overcome the world. And so should she. She
had already passed through such fiery trials that he knew no
contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that
you will act your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work
out your problem, so that you may come to me soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips. He
smothered it. &ldquo;Yes, <i>chiquita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;you will keep your promise about Anita&rsquo;s babe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill
and to Rosendo&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the
priest clung to the girl like a shadow. They talked together
but little, for she was in constant demand to help her foster-mother
in the preparations for the long journey. But Jos&egrave;
was ever at her side. Again and again he would seize her hand
and press it to his burning lips. Again and again he would
stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch her dress
as she passed him. Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face. When
she left the house, he followed. When she bent over the ash-strewn
fireplace, or washed the few plain dishes, he sought to
share her employment; and, when gently, lovingly repulsed,
sat dully, with his yearning eyes riveted upon her. Rosendo
saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity for the suffering
priest.</p>
<p>The preparations carried the toilers far into the night. But
at length the last bundle was strapped to its <i>siete</i>, the last plan
discussed and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown
themselves upon their cots for a brief rest before dawn. Rosendo
took Jos&egrave; aside, while Do&ntilde;a Maria and Carmen sought
their beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak,&rdquo; the
old man said. &ldquo;All has been kept secret. No one suspects our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page357' name='book2_page357'></a>357</span>
plans. Maria remains here with you until I return. Then we
may go to the <i>hacienda</i> of Don Nicol&aacute;s, on the Boque. I shall
tell him to have it in readiness on my return. I shall probably
not get back to Simit&iacute; for two months. If, as you say, you
still think best not to go with the Americans and the girl, what
will you do here? The people are much divided. Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you. <i>Bien</i>, will you
not decide to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; could not make audible reply. He shook his head, and
waved Rosendo away. Then, taking a chair, he went into the
sleeping room and sat down at the bedside of the slumbering
girl. Reaching over, he took her hand.</p>
<p>What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone,
when Diego claimed her as his child? Ah, yes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel badly, Padre dear. His thoughts have only the
minus sign&ndash;&ndash;and that means nothing, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And later, many weeks later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together,
you know. You can not be happy and unhappy at the
same time. You can not be sick and well together.&rdquo; In other
words, the wise little maid was trying to show him that Paul
spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye not,
that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can not have both good and evil, Padre,&rdquo; she had so
often insisted. &ldquo;You must want good&ndash;&ndash;want it more than anything
else. And then you must prepare for it by thinking
right thoughts and unthinking wrong ones. And as you prepare
for good, you must <i>know</i> that it is coming. But you
must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look like.
You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it. Leave the&ndash;&ndash;the externalization to God.
Then it will meet all your needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Padre dear&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;oh, how the memory of her words
smote him now!&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you see, the good Jesus told the people to
clean their window-panes and let in the light&ndash;&ndash;good thoughts&ndash;&ndash;for
then these would be externalized in health, happiness,
and all good, instead of the old, bad thoughts being externalized
longer in sickness and evil. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aye, he saw. He saw that the Christ-idea found expression
and reflection in the pure mentality of this girl. He saw that
that mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human
belief, and untrained to fear. He saw that the resurrection of
the Christ, for which a yearning world waits, was but the rising
of the Christ-idea in the human mentality. And he saw, too,
that ere the radiant resurrection morn can arrive there must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page358' name='book2_page358'></a>358</span>
the crucifixion, a world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal
thought. Follow Christ! Aye, follow him! But will ye not
learn that following him means <i>thinking</i> as he did? And his
thoughts were God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But Jos&egrave; had tried to think aright during those years in
Simit&iacute;. True, but the efforts had been spasmodic. From
childhood he had passed through doubt, fear, scepticism, and
final agnosticism. Then he had started anew and aright. And
then had come the &ldquo;day of judgment,&rdquo; the recurrent hours of
sore trial&ndash;&ndash;and he had not stood. Called upon to prove God,
to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had vacillated
between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly. And now he stood confronting his still
unsolved problem, realizing as never before that in the solving
of it he must unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.</p>
<p>There were other problems which lay still unsolved before
him as he sat there that night. The sable veil of mystery
which hung about Carmen&rsquo;s birth had never been penetrated,
even slightly. What woman&rsquo;s face was that which looked out
so sadly from the little locket? &ldquo;Dolores&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;sorrowful, indeed!
What tragedy had those great, mournful eyes witnessed? No,
Carmen did not greatly resemble her. He used to think so,
but not of late. Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?
And had the mother&rsquo;s kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait
beneath which he had so often read the single inscription,
&ldquo;Guillermo&rdquo;? If so, could not the portrait be cleaned? But
Jos&egrave; himself had not dared attempt it. Perhaps some day that
could be done by one skilled in such art.</p>
<p>And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from
either of her parents? Her voice, her religious instinct, her
keen mentality&ndash;&ndash;whence came they? &ldquo;From God,&rdquo; the girl
would always answer whenever he voiced the query in her
presence. And he could not gainsay it.</p>
<p>Seven years had passed. And Jos&egrave; found himself sitting
beside the sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation
which now had come. Was his work finished? His course
run? And, if he must live and solve his problem, could he
stand after she had left? He bent closer to her, and listened
to the gentle breathing. He seemed again to see her, as he
was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive rose
garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless
joy. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he heard her call. &ldquo;Come, Padre dear, and see
my beautiful thoughts!&rdquo; And then, so often, &ldquo;Oh, Padre!&rdquo;
bounding into his arms, &ldquo;here is a beautiful thought that came
to me to-day, and I caught it and wouldn&rsquo;t let it go!&rdquo; Lonely,
isolated child, having nothing in common with the children of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page359' name='book2_page359'></a>359</span>
her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a world peopled with
immaculate concepts!</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; shook his head slowly. He thought of the day when
he had approached Rosendo with his great question. &ldquo;Rosendo,&rdquo;
he had said in deep earnestness, &ldquo;where, oh, where
did Carmen get these ideas? Did you teach them to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Padre,&rdquo; Rosendo had replied gravely. &ldquo;When she was
a little thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.
And one day I told her that God was everywhere&ndash;&ndash;what else
could I say? <i>Bien</i>, a strange light came into her eyes. And
after that, Padre, she talked continually about Him, and to
Him. And she seemed to know Him well&ndash;&ndash;so well that she
saw Him in every thing and every place. Padre, it is very
strange&ndash;&ndash;very strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, it was not strange, Jos&egrave; had thought, but beautifully
natural. And later, when he came to teach her, his constant
endeavor had been to impart his secular knowledge to the
girl without endangering her marvelous faith in her immanent
God. In that he had succeeded, for in that there had been no
obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.</p>
<p>And now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
mercies will I gather thee&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night shadows fled. Day dawned. Jos&egrave; still sat at the
girl&rsquo;s bedside, dumb and motionless. Carmen awoke, and
threw her arms about him. But Rosendo appeared and hurried
her out to the light morning repast, for they must lose no
time in starting. Every moment now was precious. By ten
o&rsquo;clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and they lay
some distance from Simit&iacute;. Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they
strapped the chairs to the men&rsquo;s backs. Do&ntilde;a Maria&rsquo;s eyes were
red with weeping, but she kept silence. Jos&egrave; wandered about
like a wraith. Don Jorge grimly packed his own kit and prepared
to set out for the Magdalena, for he had suddenly announced
his determination not to accompany Rosendo and his
party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos Noros&iacute; in
regard to the future. An hour later he left Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>At last Rosendo&rsquo;s voice rang out in a great shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ya est&aacute;! V&aacute;monos!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully-bueno!&rdquo; responded Harris, waving his long arms.</p>
<p>The <i>cargadores</i> moved forward in the direction of the
Boque trail. The Americans, with a final <i>adios</i> to Do&ntilde;a Maria
and the priest, swung into line behind them. Rosendo again
tenderly embraced his weeping spouse, and then, turned to
Jos&egrave;.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page360' name='book2_page360'></a>360</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre! I leave
her in your care. If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both
cheeks. Then, calling to Carmen, he turned and started after
the others.</p>
<p>The girl rushed into Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s arms. Her tears flowed freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre,&rdquo; she murmured, clinging to him and showering
him with kisses, &ldquo;I love you, love you, love you! I will wait
for you up there. You will come&ndash;&ndash;or I will come back to you.
And I will work for you every day. I will know that you are
God&rsquo;s child, and that you will solve your problem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply
to her. The girl hurried after him. But again she stopped,
turned around, and flew back to Jos&egrave;, as he knelt in the dust
and, with tongue cleaving to his mouth, held out his trembling
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padre, dearest, dearest Padre,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I love you, I
love you! And&ndash;&ndash;I had forgotten&ndash;&ndash;this&ndash;&ndash;it is for you to read
every day&ndash;&ndash;every day!&rdquo; She thrust a folded paper into his
hand. Again she tore herself away and ran after the impatient
Rosendo. In a moment they were out of sight.</p>
<p>A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest. He rose
from his knees and followed stumbling after the girl. As he
reached the shales he saw her far in the distance at the mouth
of the trail. She turned, and waved her hand to him. Then
the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw her no more.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile
gaze to penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that
had engulfed his very soul. His bloodshot eyes were wild.
His lips fluttered. His hand closed convulsively over the paper
which the girl had left with him. Mechanically he opened it
and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave with
you; and you will promise your little girl that you will always live by
them. Then your problem will be solved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. Thou shall have no other gods before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
is perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, <i>God is everywhere</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His hand fell. His brain reeled, and he swayed like a
drunken man. He turned about, muttering incoherently.
Do&ntilde;a Maria stood behind him. Tenderly taking his arm, she
led him back to the forlorn little house. Its ghastly emptiness
smote him until his reason tottered. He sank into a chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page361' name='book2_page361'></a>361</span>
and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid lake, where
the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into myriad
colors against the brume.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 37</h2>
</div>
<p>The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his
little band stretched their rugged, forbidding length
through ragged ca&ntilde;ons, rushing waters, and dank, virginal
forest. Only the old man, as he trudged along the worn
trail between Simit&iacute; and the Inanea river, where canoes
waited to transport the travelers to the little village of Boque,
had any adequate conception of what the journey meant. Even
the <i>cargadores</i> were unfamiliar with the region which they
were to penetrate. Some of them had been over the Guamoc&oacute;
trail as far as Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to
its farthest navigable point. But none had penetrated the inmost
reaches of the great ca&ntilde;on through which the headwaters
tumbled and roared, and none had ever dreamed of
making the passage over the great divide, the <i>Barra Principal</i>,
to the Tigu&iacute; beyond.</p>
<p>To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention
of city life, and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of
adventure, the prospect was absorbing in its allurements.
Especially to the excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great
eyes almost popped from his head at the continuous display of
tropical marvels, and whose exclamations of astonishment and
surprise, enriched from his inexhaustible store of American
slang and miner&rsquo;s parlance, burst from his gaping mouth at
every turn of the sinuous trail. From the outset, he had constituted
himself Carmen&rsquo;s special protector, although much to
Rosendo&rsquo;s consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying
against every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly
giving noisy vent to his opinions regarding trails in general,
and those of the tropics in particular. His only accouterment
was a Winchester rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted
on carrying in constant readiness to meet either beasts of prey
or savage Indians, but which, in his absent-mindedness and
dreamy preoccupation, he either dragged, muzzle up, or carried
at such dangerous angles that the natives were finally
obliged, in self-protection, to insist that he hand the weapon
over to Rosendo. To Carmen, as the days passed and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page362' name='book2_page362'></a>362</span>
gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he became a source
of delight. Hour after hour she trotted along after him, chatting
merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at his
awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang
and na&iuml;ve Yankee expressions. She had never heard such things
from Jos&egrave;; nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge,
ever told her such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew
from his store of frontier memories and colored his narratives
with the rich tints furnished by his easy imagination.</p>
<p>The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the
girl. She had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell
to Jos&egrave;, with a feeling that she had never experienced before.
For hours she trudged along, oblivious of her environment,
murmuring, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo; until Harris, his
curiosity aroused by the constant repetition which floated now
and then to his ears, demanded to know what it was that was
so radically false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true that we can be separated,&rdquo; she answered, looking
at him with moist eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, God&rsquo;s children&ndash;&ndash;people&ndash;&ndash;people&ndash;&ndash;who&ndash;&ndash;love each
other,&rdquo; she replied. Then she dropped her eyes in evident
embarrassment, and refused to discuss the topic further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Harry!&rdquo; ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical
remark, &ldquo;you surely are a queer little dud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl turned from him to Rosendo. He understood
her. Nor would she permit the old man to leave her until,
late that night, exhausted by the excitement of the day, she
dropped asleep in the house of Don Nicol&aacute;s, on the muddy
margin of the river Boque, still clinging to Rosendo&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Despite the protestations of Don Nicol&aacute;s and the pleading
of the <i>cargadores</i>, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at
Boque. Apprehension lashed him furiously on. They were
still within reach of the federal authorities. He dared not rest
until the jungle had swallowed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>compadre</i>,&rdquo; said Don Nicol&aacute;s, in disappointment, &ldquo;I
would like much for you to enjoy my house while it is still
clean. For the ants have visited me. <i>Hombre</i>! they swarmed
down upon us but a day ago. They came out of the bush in
millions, straight for the house. We fled. <i>Caramba</i>! had we
remained, we should have been eaten alive. But they swept
the house&ndash;&ndash;<i>Hombre</i>! no human hands could have done so well.
Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was instantly
eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again, and
we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page363' name='book2_page363'></a>363</span>
Carmen, whom he had constituted his interpreter, translated
to him the story.</p>
<p>That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before
the house, and the Americans had tickled the palates of the
villagers with some tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don
Nicol&aacute;s approached Reed. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my mother,
now very aged, is sick, and we think she can not recover. But
you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your medicines
powerful. Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman&rsquo;s sufferings? They are severe,
se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people
in the wisdom of the American, and he had reason to wish to
preserve it. But he had come into that country illy prepared
to cope with disease, and his medical equipment contained
nothing but quinine. He reflected a moment, then turned to
Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract
into the equipment?&rdquo; he inquired, his eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Reed, &ldquo;dig out a bottle and we&rsquo;ll fix up a
dose of pain-killer for our worthy host&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to Don Nicol&aacute;s. &ldquo;Cierto, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said
with an air of confidence. &ldquo;I have a remedy which I know to
be unfailing for any disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged
again in a few moments with an empty cola bottle. Washing
this clean in the river, he partly filled it with water. Then he
poured in the small bottle of root-beer extract which Harris
handed him, and added a few grains of quinine. Shaking the
mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don Nicol&aacute;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be very careful, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he admonished, giving him the
bottle. &ldquo;It is a medicine extremely powerful and immediate
in its action. Give the se&ntilde;ora a small teaspoonful every hour.
By morning you will notice a marked change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Nicol&aacute;s&rsquo;s eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude
poured forth in extravagant expressions.</p>
<p>With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was
abroad, rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering
as to their respective duties, and arranging the luggage in
the canoes for the river trip. Additional boats and men had
been secured; and Don Nicol&aacute;s himself expressed his intention
of accompanying them as far as his hacienda, Maria Rosa,
a day&rsquo;s journey up-stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was there that I hid during the last revolution,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;when the soldiers burned the village and cut off the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page364' name='book2_page364'></a>364</span>
ears and fingers of our women for their rings. Ah, se&ntilde;ores,
you can not know how we suffered! All my goods stolen or
burned&ndash;&ndash;my family scattered&ndash;&ndash;my <i>finca</i> destroyed! We lived
two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to come down the river
again. We wore the skins of animals for clothing. <i>Caramba</i>!&rdquo;
His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively. He was a representative of that large
class of <i>rurales</i> upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest
suffering, and the most poignant sorrow attending a political
revolution always fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, &ldquo;I
had all but forgotten! My mother, she sends for you. She
would see the kind American whose remedies are so wonderful.
For, se&ntilde;or, she rose from her bed this morning restored!
And you must leave us another bottle of the remedy&ndash;&ndash;at whatever
price, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length
the truth dawned upon him. His root-beer remedy had done
its work! Then a broad grin mantled his face; but he quickly
suppressed it and went with Don Nicol&aacute;s to receive in person
his patient&rsquo;s effusive thanks. When he returned and took his
place in the waiting boat, he shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past all
understanding,&rdquo; he muttered to Harris, &ldquo;what faith will do!
I can believe now that it will remove mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring
men poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and
pushed against the increasing current, until, as the shadows
began to close around them, they sighted the scarcely visible
opening in the bush which marked the trail to the <i>hacienda</i> of
Maria Rosa. It was a desperately lonely clearing on the verge
of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered sheds, and
to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and protection.
Before they made the landing Rosendo&rsquo;s sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through
the bush; and Reed&rsquo;s quick shots had brought them both down.
The men&rsquo;s eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into
the canoes. It meant fresh meat instead of salt <i>bagre</i> for at
least two days.</p>
<p>Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don
Nicol&aacute;s and set their course again up-stream. They would now
see no human being other than the members of their own little
party until they reached Llano, on the distant Nech&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; called Don Nicol&aacute;s, as the canoes drifted
out into the stream, &ldquo;the <i>quebrada</i> of Caracol&iacute; is the third on
the right. An old trail used to lead from there across to the
Tiguicito&ndash;&ndash;but I doubt if you find even a trace of it now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page365' name='book2_page365'></a>365</span>
There is no water between that point and the Tiguicito.
<i>Conque, adios, se&ntilde;ores, adios</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died
away in the dark forest on either hand. Harris and Reed
settled back in their canoe and yielded to the fascination of the
slowly shifting scene. Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe
with them, and perforce Rosendo acted as <i>patron</i>. They
therefore took the lead. Between his knees Reed held the
rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose curiosity might
bring it to the water&rsquo;s edge to view the rare pageant passing
through that unbroken solitude.</p>
<p>The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids
whose ascent necessitated disembarking from the canoes,
while the <i>bogas</i> strained and teased the lumbering dugouts up
over them. In places the stream was choked by fallen trees
and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow, tortuous opening
was left, through which the waters raced like a mill-course,
making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the <i>bogas</i>. Often
slender islets rose from the river; and then heated, chattering,
often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to the
proper channel to take. Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees,
from which innumerable trailers and <i>bejuco</i> vines dropped
into the waters beneath. From the surface of the river to the
tops of the great trees, often two hundred feet above, hung a
drapery of creeping plants, of parasitical growths, and diversified
foliage, of the most vivid shades of green, inextricably
laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there with orchideous
flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered sunlight
which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and
spotted in orange, blue, and vivid red. Scarcely a hand&rsquo;s
breadth of the jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie
animal or vegetable form that brought expressions of wonder
and astonishment from the enraptured Americans. At times,
too, there were grim tragedies being enacted before them. In
one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate, lace-like web
hung to the water&rsquo;s edge, was viciously wrapping its silken
thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled. Again,
a shriek from beyond the river&rsquo;s margin told of some careless
monkey or small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry
jaguar. Above the travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous
buzzards, with their watchful, speculative eyes ever on the
slowly moving cavalcade.</p>
<p>Carmen sat enthralled. If her thought reverted at all to
the priest, she gave no hint of it. But once, leaning back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page366' name='book2_page366'></a>366</span>
gazing off into the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured:
&ldquo;And to think, it is only the way the human mind translates
God&rsquo;s ideas! How wonderful must they be! And some day I
shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind&rsquo;s interpretations
of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in
English. But she refused. &ldquo;You would not understand,&rdquo; she
said simply. And no badinage on his part could further influence
her.</p>
<p>Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight
of responsibility which he felt. Only twice that day did he
emerge from the deep reserve into which he had retired; once
when, in the far distance, his keen eye espied a small deer,
drinking at the water&rsquo;s edge, but which, scenting the travelers,
fled into cover ere Reed could bring the rifle to his shoulders;
and again, when they were upon a jaguar almost before either
they or the astonished animal realized it.</p>
<p>In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted
birds and insects. Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from
their midday <i>siesta</i> and scampered noisily through the treetops
over the aerial highways formed by the liana vines, whose
great bush-ropes, often a foot and more in thickness, stretched
their winding length long distances through the forest, and
bound the vegetation together in an intricate, impenetrable
network. Yellow and purple blossoms, in a riot of ineffable
splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled parasitical creepers
that wrapped around them, constituting veritable hanging
gardens. Great palms, fattened by the almost incessant rains
in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces unoccupied by
the buttressed roots of the forest giants. Splendidly tailored
kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its surface.
Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers. Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated <i>colibr&iacute;</i>, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent
flowers. On the <i>playas</i> in the hazy distance ahead the travelers
could often distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their
grotesque measures, or standing on one leg and dreaming
away their little hour of life in this terrestrial fairy-land.</p>
<p>Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.
For an hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the
right bank of the river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.
But, as night closed in, a soft murmur floated down
to the cramped, toil-worn travelers, and the old man, with a
glad light in his eyes, announced that they were approaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page367' name='book2_page367'></a>367</span>
the <i>quebrada</i> of Caracol&iacute;. A half hour later, by the weird,
flickering light of the candles which Reed and Harris held out
on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a brawling
stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil. Plunging
fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined the
margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great
<i>machete</i> and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle,
thatch-covered hut a few yards beyond. It was the tumbled
vestige of a shelter which Don Nicol&aacute;s had erected years before
while hunting wild pigs through this trackless region. An
hour later the little group lay asleep on the damp ground,
wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.</p>
<p>The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening
into ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty
trees as with streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable
Nemesis, prodded his little party into activity. Their first
day&rsquo;s march through the wilderness was to begin, and the old
man moved with the nervous, restless energy of a hunted
jaguar. The light breakfast of coffee and cold <i>arepa</i> over, he
dismissed the <i>bogas</i>, who were to return to Boque with the
canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable packs
for the <i>cargadores</i> who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.
Two <i>macheteros</i> were sent on ahead of the main party to
locate and open a trail. The rest followed an hour later. Before
the shimmering, opalescent rays which overspread the
eastern sky had begun to turn downward, the little cavalcade,
led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow, newly-cut trail and
plunged into the shadows of the forest&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 38</h2>
</div>
<p>The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human
temperament. Where one sees in it naught but a &ldquo;grim,
green sepulcher,&rdquo; teeming with malignant, destructive
forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to life, another&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
a member of the same party&ndash;&ndash;will find in the wanton
extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite variety
of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development,
as to constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the
habit which too often follows the first draft of the opium&rsquo;s
fumes. There are those who profess to have journeyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page368' name='book2_page368'></a>368</span>
through vast stretches of South American <i>selva</i> without encountering
a wild animal. Others, with sight and hearing
keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by futile
lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the
memory throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible
desire to penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling
solitudes.</p>
<p>It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation. And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic. For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.
It grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur. It does not
entice admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force. Its
silence is a dull roar. Its rest is continuous motion, incessant
activity. The garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great
daubs of vivid color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife&ndash;&ndash;never
modulated, never worked into delicate shading with the
brush, but attracting by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its
disdain of convention, its utter disregard of the canons cherished
by the puny mind that contemplates it. The forest&rsquo;s appeal
is a reflex of its own infinite complexity. The sensations
which it arouses within the one who steps from civilization into
its very heart are myriad, and often terrible. The instinct of
self-preservation is by it suddenly, rudely aroused and kept
keenly alive. Its inhospitality is menacing. The roar of its
howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart. The plaintive
calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through the
mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit world.
The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable sounds
that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the face
and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely sheathed
weapon. The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or
the dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening
yearning toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the
sense of protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently
less.</p>
<p>Because of Nature&rsquo;s utter disregard of the individual, life
is everywhere. And that life is sharply armed and on the
defensive. The rising heat-waves hum with insects. The
bush swarms with them. Their droning murmur crowds the
air. The trunks of trees, the great, pendent leaves of plants,
the trailing vines, slimy with dank vegetation, afford footing
and housing to countless myriads of them, keenly alert, ferociously
resistive. The decaying logs fester with scorpions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page369' name='book2_page369'></a>369</span>
The ground is cavernous with the burrows of lizards and crawling
forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae. Death and
terror stalk hand in hand. But life trails them. Where one
falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap. The rivers and
<i>pantanos</i> yield their quota of variegated forms. The flat
<i>perania</i>, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams,
and inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who
dare invade its domain. Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and
lagoons, the brilliant coral and the deadly <i>m&aacute;pina</i>. Beneath
the forest leaves coils the brown adder, whose sting proves
fatal within three days.</p>
<p>To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey
such as that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little
band would prove a terrifying experience, a constant repetition
of nerve-shocks, under which the &ldquo;centers&rdquo; must ultimately
give way. But to the two Americans, fresh from the
mining camps of the West, and attuned to any pitch that
Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the experience
was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling. Rosendo and his men accepted
the day&rsquo;s stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.
Carmen threw herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting
environment only the human mind&rsquo;s interpretation of its
mixed concept of good and evil. The insects swarmed around
her as around the others. The tantalizing <i>jejenes</i> urged their
insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest. Her hands were
dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous gnats had
fed. But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his
own red hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;But you have no religion,
and you don&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&ndash;as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t understand? And it isn&rsquo;t true, eh? Well, you have
mighty strange beliefs, young lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not as strange and illogical as those you hold,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe anything,&rdquo; he answered, with a shrug
of his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an agnostic, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is just where you mistake, Mr. Harris,&rdquo; she returned
gravely. &ldquo;For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly
believe in the presence and power of evil. It is just those very
people who boast that they do not believe in anything who believe
most thoroughly in evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but
the human mind&rsquo;s concepts of God&rsquo;s ideas&ndash;&ndash;not real. Adam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page370' name='book2_page370'></a>370</span>
had named them. In the Bible allegory, or dream, the human,
mortal mind names all its own material concepts.</p>
<p>The days wore on with dull regularity. From the rippling
Tiguicito, which they reached choking with thirst and utterly
exhausted, they dropped down again to the Boque, where they
established camps and began to prospect the Molino company&rsquo;s
&ldquo;near-mines,&rdquo; as Harris called them after the first few unsuccessful
attempts to get &ldquo;colors&rdquo; out of the barren soil. At
certain points, where there seemed a more likely prospect,
they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo&rsquo;s guidance,
could sink pits to the underlying bedrock. Such work
was done with the crudest of tools&ndash;&ndash;an iron bar, wooden scrapers
in lieu of shovels, and wooden <i>bateas</i> in which the men
handed the loosened dirt up from one stage to another and
out to the surface. It was slow, torturing work. The men
grew restive. The food ran low, and they complained.</p>
<p>Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as
the great animal had forded the river and was shambling into
the bush opposite. He emptied his rifle magazine into the
beast. It fell with a broken hip, and the men finished it with
their <i>machetes</i>. Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness,
and covered with <i>garrapatas</i>&ndash;&ndash;fierce, burrowing vermin, with
hooked claws, which came upon the travelers and caused them
intense annoyance throughout the remainder of the journey.</p>
<p>Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that
had never seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.
Later, Fidel Avila felled another with a large stone. And,
finally, monkeys became so plentiful that the men all but refused
to eat them any longer.</p>
<p>Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito
and the Boque ca&ntilde;on. Then Reed gave the order to advance.
The little party shouldered their packs and began the ascent
of the ragged gorge. For days they clambered up and down
the jagged walls of the cut, or skirted its densely covered margin.
Twice Harris fell into the brawling stream below, and
was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes popping, and his mouth
choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding mountain
travel in the tropics. Once, seizing a slender vine to aid him
in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep. Again Rosendo,
who by this time had learned to keep one eye on the ground
and the other on the irresponsible Harris, rescued him from
his perilous position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you watch where you are going?&rdquo; queried the
laughing Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might,&rdquo; sputtered Harris, &ldquo;if I could keep my eyes off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page371' name='book2_page371'></a>371</span>
of you.&rdquo; Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to
reserve his compliments for those who knew how to appraise
them rightly.</p>
<p>They camped where night overtook them, out in the open,
often falling asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating
soggy corn <i>arepa</i> and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee
left from the early morning repast. But sometimes, when the
fatigue of day was less, they would gather about their little
fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen to sing to them
while they prepared supper. Then her clear voice would ring
out over the great ca&ntilde;on and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds
of the jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at
her as if they half believed her a creature from another world.
Sometimes Harris would draw her into conversation on topics
pertaining to philosophy and religion, for he had early seen
her bent and, agnostic that he was, delighted to hear her express
her views, which to him were so childishly impossible.
But as often he would voluntarily retire from the conflict,
sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes muttering
his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute. He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for
proofs, for less human belief and more demonstration, he
hoisted the white flag and retired from the field. But his admiration
for the child became sincere. His respect for her
waxed daily stronger. And by the time they had reached the
great divide through which the Rosario fell, he was dimly
aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship
and fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was
something more than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate
vaguely on a possible future in which she became the
central figure.</p>
<p>At Rosario creek they left the great ca&ntilde;on and turned into
the rugged defile which wound its tortuous course upward into
the heights of the <i>Barra Principal</i>. They were now in a region
where, in Rosendo&rsquo;s belief, there was not one human being
in an area of a hundred square miles. He himself was in sore
doubt as to the identity of the <i>quebrada</i> which they were following.
But it tallied with the brief description given him by
Don Nicol&aacute;s. And, moreover, which was even more important,
as they began its ascent there came to him that sense of
conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course. He might not say how he knew he
was right; but he followed the leading without further question.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page372' name='book2_page372'></a>372</span></div>
<p>Up over the steep talus at the base of the ca&ntilde;on wall they
clambered, up into the narrowing <i>arroyo</i>, cutting every foot
of the way, for the <i>macheteros</i> were now no longer keeping
ahead of them&ndash;&ndash;the common danger held the band united.
Often they believed they discovered traces of ancient trails.
But the jealous forest had all but obliterated them, and they
could not be certain. In the higher and drier parts of the
forest, where they left the creek and followed the beds of dead
streams, slender ditches through which the water raced in
torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by countless
swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for
the salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human
bodies. Harris swore he would cease to eat, for he could not
take even a mouthful of food without at the same time taking
in a multitude of bees. Often, too, their <i>machetes</i> cut into
great hornet nests. Then, with the shrill cry, &ldquo;<i>Avispas</i>!&rdquo; Rosendo
would tear recklessly through the matted jungle, followed
by his slapping, stumbling companions, until the maddened
insects gave up the chase. Frequently they walked
into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the great
<i>tucanderas</i>, so ferociously poisonous. &ldquo;Ah, se&ntilde;ores,&rdquo; commented
Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the
jungle, &ldquo;in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters
would often tie the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths
of the forest and let these great ants devour them alive!
Se&ntilde;ores, you can never know the terrible crimes committed by
the Spaniards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they were Christians!&rdquo; murmured Harris, eying Carmen
furtively.</p>
<p>But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard
had never known the Christ.</p>
<p>Night was spent on the summit of the divide. Then, without
further respite, Rosendo urged the descent. Down through
ravines and gullies; over monster bowlders; waist deep through
streams; down the sheer sides of gorges on natural ladders
formed by the hanging <i>mora</i> vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of
tangled and interlaced roots of rank, wet vegetation; and then
down again into river bottoms, where the tenacious mud challenged
their every step, and the streams became an interminable
morass, through which passage was possible only by jumping
from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the great trees
projected above the bottomless ooze. The persecution of the
<i>jejenes</i> became diabolical. At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page373' name='book2_page373'></a>373</span>
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing. The
men grew morose and sullen. Reed and Harris quarreled with
each other on the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>Then, to increase their misery, came the rain. It fell upon
them in the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets
that blotted out the forest and wet their very souls. The
heavens split with the lightning. The mountains roared and
trembled with the hideous cannonade of thunder. The jungle-matted
hills ran with the flood. An unvaried pall of vapor hung
over the steaming ground, through which uncanny, phantasmagoric
shapes peered at the struggling little band.</p>
<p>Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above
the moist earth. The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid
odor of the wet soil increased the enervation of their hard
travel. Again and again the peevish Harris accused Rosendo
of having lost the way. The old man patiently bore the abuse.
Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled violently with him,
although his own apprehension waxed continually greater.
Carmen said little. Hour after hour she toiled along, floundering
through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo&rsquo;s
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing
and pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.
In vain at evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging
firewood, Harris would bring up to her the causes of her flight.
In vain he would accuse the unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop,
the soldiers. Carmen refused to lend ear to it, or to see in it
anything more than a varied expression of the human mind.
Personality was never for a moment considered. She saw, not
persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the phenomena
which had combined to urge her out of her former
environment and cast her into the trackless jungle.</p>
<p>At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers
that human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who
had long been straining his ears in the direction straight ahead,
announced that the singing noise which floated to them as
they descended a low hill and plunged into a thicket of tall
lush grass, undoubtedly came from the river Tigu&iacute;. Another
hour of straining and plunging through the dense growth
followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon
the east bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering
in the bright morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary
way through the great jungle.</p>
<p>The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length
upon the ground. Rosendo pointed across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Colorado,&rdquo; he said, indicating what the Americans at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page374' name='book2_page374'></a>374</span>
length made out to be a frame house, looming above the high
grass. &ldquo;And there,&rdquo; pointing to the north, &ldquo;is <i>Pozo Cayman</i>,
where the trail begins that leads to La Libertad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the
house at La Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided
Frenchmen who, years before, had penetrated this wild
region, located a barren quartz vein, then floated a company
and begun developments. A considerable colony settled here.
The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country ceaselessly rich
in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and abounding
in fish. The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.
It seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise. But then
came the insidious fever. It crept out of the jungle like a thief
in the night. One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.
Panic seized upon them. Those unafflicted fled&ndash;&ndash;all but one.
He remained to protect the company&rsquo;s property. But he, too,
fell a victim to the plague. One day, as he lay burning upon
his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining servant, the
native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine. She
hastened to comply; but, alas! she brought the packet of strychnine
instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all. The old woman
fled in terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.
They haunt it yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.</p>
<p>Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange
sensations. The clouds above had broken, and the late moon
streamed through the night vapor, and poured through the
bamboo walls of the house. The giant frogs in the nearby
creek awoke, and through the long night croaked their mournful
plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to the awed
Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had
roamed this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the
Spaniard descended like a dark cloud and, with rack and
stake, fastened his blighting religion upon them.</p>
<p>A day&rsquo;s rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of
the party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten
hour journey over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.
For this trip Rosendo would take only the Americans and
Carmen. The <i>cargadores</i> were not to know the nature of this
expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was undertaken that
the Americans might explore for two days the region around
the upper Tigu&iacute;. The men received this explanation with
grunts of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of
fatigue, hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page375' name='book2_page375'></a>375</span>
man that day over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten
mine of Don Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n. They experienced all the
sensations of those who find themselves at last on the course
that leads to buried treasure. To Harris, the romance attaching
to the expedition obliterated all other considerations. But
Reed was busy with the practical end of it, with costs, with the
problems of supplies, of transportation, and trail. Carmen
saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simit&iacute;, whose ancestor
once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.</p>
<p>When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at
the mouth of the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel
bearing the scarce distinguishable inscription, &ldquo;I de R.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of
baked alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amacer&iacute;, near the
dirty, straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as
they saw issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoc&oacute; trail a
staggering band of travelers, among them two foreigners,
whose clothes were in shreds and whose beards and unkempt
hair were caked with yellow mud. With them came a young
girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope <i>alpargates</i> on her bare
feet. The heat was descending in torrents. From the neighboring
town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices. It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious <i>fiesta</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Compadres</i>,&rdquo; said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated
group. &ldquo;The boat&ndash;&ndash;which way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in
expressive pantomime up-stream. Rosendo murmured a fervent
&ldquo;<i>Loado sea Dios</i>,&rdquo; and sank upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be down to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;to-day, perhaps,&rdquo; gurgled another
of the rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from
one member to another of the weird-looking little band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the
damp ground and mopped his muddy brow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a salamander
for heat, that&rsquo;s certain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Rosendo, addressing Reed, &ldquo;it would be well
to pay the men at once, for the boat may appear at any time,
and it will not wait long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the curious group from the village crowded about and
eagerly watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack
and drew out a bundle of Colombian bills, with which he began
to pay the <i>cargadores</i>, according to the reckoning which Rosendo
had kept. As the last man, with a grunt of satisfaction,
received his money, Harris exclaimed: &ldquo;And to think, one
good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page376' name='book2_page376'></a>376</span>
whistle came echoing down the river. A cloud of smoke
above the distant treetops heralded the approach of the steamer.
The little party had escaped a wait of a month in the
drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of an hour.</p>
<p>Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside. He tried to
speak, but words failed him. Reed took his hand. &ldquo;I understand,
my friend,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Have no fear. The mine
is all I had anticipated. My wife and I will care for the girl
until we hear from you. And we will keep in touch with you,
although it will take two months for a letter to reach us and
our reply to get back again to Simit&iacute;. The development company
will be formed at once. Within six months you may
expect to see the work started. It is your fortune&ndash;&ndash;and the
girl&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen drew close to Rosendo. &ldquo;Padre, I am coming back
to you&ndash;&ndash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto, chiquita</i>!&rdquo; The old man would not permit himself
to say more. The girl had known for some time that he
was not to accompany her to the States, and that she should
not see Ana in Cartagena. To this she had at length accustomed
herself.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and
thrown out its gang plank. A hurried embrace; a struggle
with rushing tears; another shriek from the boat whistle; and
the Americans, with Carmen standing mute and motionless
between them, looked back at the fading group on shore, where
Rosendo&rsquo;s tall figure stood silhouetted against the green background
of the forest. For a moment he held his arm extended
toward them. Carmen knew, as she looked at the great-hearted
man for the last time, that his benediction was following her&ndash;&ndash;following
her into that new world into which he might not
enter.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the
dinkey train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten
days later, and took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his
anxious, fretting wife awaited. Their boat had hung on a
hidden bar in the Cauca river for four interminable, torturing
days.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 39</h2>
</div>
<p>On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered
down the Guamoc&oacute; trail into Simit&iacute;. On that same
momentous day the flames of war again flared up throughout
the country. The Simit&iacute; episode, in which the President
had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity of action. A
few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious measure
was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a
law.</p>
<p>But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time
was required for this act of Congress to become generally
known. The delay saw Carmen through the jungle and down
to the coast. There Reed lost no time in transacting what business
still remained for him in Cartagena, and securing transportation
for his party to New York.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave;, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo&rsquo;s
hand, imploring the constant repetition of the old
man&rsquo;s narrative. Then came Juan, flying to the door. He
had seen and talked with the returned <i>cargadores</i>. The girl
had not come back with them. He demanded to know why.
He became wild. Neither Jos&egrave; nor Rosendo could calm him.
At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return
to Simit&iacute; no more.</p>
<p>The blow almost crushed the lad. He rushed about the
town half dazed. He gathered groups of companions about
him and talked to them excitedly. He threatened Rosendo and
Jos&egrave;. Then, evidently acting on the advice of some cooler head,
he rushed to his canoe and put off across the lake toward the
<i>ca&ntilde;o</i>. He did not return for several days. But when he did,
the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and that
the country was aflame with war.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Reed&rsquo;s wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame
of mind. &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Charles,&rdquo; she had cried, turning
from his embrace to look at the wondering girl who stood
behind him, &ldquo;what have you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; he laughingly replied, &ldquo;is only a little Indian I
lassoed back in the jungle.&rdquo; And, leaving the girl to the not
very tender graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for
the return voyage.</p>
<p>At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed&rsquo;s room, Carmen
rushed to him and begged to be taken for a stroll through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page378' name='book2_page378'></a>378</span>
town. Yielding to her husband&rsquo;s insistence, Mrs. Reed had
outfitted the girl, so that she presented a more civilized appearance.
At first Carmen had been delighted with her new
clothes. They were such, cheap as they were, as she had never
seen in Simit&iacute;. But the shoes&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Ah, se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;do
not make me wear them, they are so tight! I have never worn
shoes before.&rdquo; She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.</p>
<p>As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public
square, while the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue
of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, a ragged little urchin approached and
begged them to buy an afternoon paper. Harris humored him
and bade Carmen ask him his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rinc&oacute;n,&rdquo; the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly.</p>
<p>The girl started. &ldquo;Rinc&oacute;n!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;where
do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Calle Lozano,&rdquo; he replied, wondering why these
people seemed interested in him.</p>
<p>Carmen translated the conversation to Harris. &ldquo;Ask him
who his father is,&rdquo; suggested the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied the little fellow, shaking his head.
&ldquo;I never saw him. He lives far away, up the great river, so
Tia Catalina says. And she says he is a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color suddenly left Carmen&rsquo;s cheeks. &ldquo;Come with me
to your home,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand.</p>
<p>The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to
the little upper room where, years before, he had first seen the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tia Catalina,&rdquo; he cried to the shabby woman who rose in
amazement as the visitors entered, &ldquo;see, some strangers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little fellow&rsquo;s father&ndash;&ndash;he is a Rinc&oacute;n? And&ndash;&ndash;he lives
up the great river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without
replying. But the boy answered for her. &ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo;
he said eagerly, &ldquo;in Simit&iacute;. And his name&ndash;&ndash;I am named for
him&ndash;&ndash;it is Jos&egrave;. And I am going to visit him some day. Tia
Catalina said I should, no, Tia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money,
which he handed to the woman. Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous
smile spread over her wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah, gracias, se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; she murmured, bending over his
hand; &ldquo;we need it. The boy&rsquo;s father has sent us but little of
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s heart was fluttering wildly. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page379' name='book2_page379'></a>379</span>
a cold voice, &ldquo;the boy&rsquo;s father is Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, of
Simit&iacute;? You need not fear to speak. We have just come from
Simit&iacute;, and have seen him. We are leaving to-morrow for the
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; replied the woman in a thin, cracking
voice, now completely disarmed of her suspicion. &ldquo;The little
fellow was born here some seven years ago. Ah, well I remember
the day! And his mother, poor little lamb! She
died the same night. But the good Padre has sent us money
ever since to care for him, until of late. Se&ntilde;orita, why is it,
think you, that he sends us so little now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;do&ndash;&ndash;not&ndash;&ndash;know,&rdquo; murmured Carmen abstractedly,
scarce hearing the woman. Then she turned to the boy. She
bent over him and looked long and wistfully into his eyes.
He was a bright, handsome little fellow; and though her heart
was crushed, she took him into it. Swallowing the lump which
had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&ndash;&ndash;I know him&ndash;&ndash;well. He is a&ndash;&ndash;a good man.
But&ndash;&ndash;I did not know&ndash;&ndash;I never knew that he had a son.&rdquo; She
stopped, choking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tia Catalina says he is a fine man,&rdquo; proudly answered the
boy. &ldquo;And she wants me to be a priest, too. But I am going
to be a bull-fighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; interposed the woman. &ldquo;We cannot
keep him from the <i>arena</i> now. He hangs about it all day, and
about the slaughter-house. We can hardly drag him back to
his meals. What can we do, se&ntilde;orita? But,&rdquo; with a touch of
pride as she looked at him, &ldquo;if he becomes a bull-fighter, he
will be the best of them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned again to the woman. Her question carried
an appeal which came from the depths of her soul. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,
is there no doubt&ndash;&ndash;no doubt that Padre Rinc&oacute;n is the father
of the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think not, se&ntilde;orita. The lad&rsquo;s mother died in the
good Padre&rsquo;s arms. She would not say positively who was the
boy&rsquo;s father. We thought at first&ndash;&ndash;it was some one else. Marcelena
insisted on it to her dying day. But now&ndash;&ndash;now we
know that it was Padre Jos&egrave;. And he was sent to Simit&iacute; for
it. But&ndash;&ndash;ah, se&ntilde;orita, the little mother was so beautiful,
and so good! She&ndash;&ndash;but, se&ntilde;orita, you are not leaving
so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen had risen. &ldquo;Yes, my good se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; she said wearily.
&ldquo;We must now return to the hotel. But&ndash;&ndash;here is more
money for the boy. And, se&ntilde;ora, when I reach the States I
will send you money every month for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book2_page380' name='book2_page380'></a>380</span></div>
<p>She took Harris&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;I have
seen enough of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was
put into the hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat
in his study, wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers
before him. Hostilities had begun along the Magdalena river
the day before. The gates of Cartagena were to be barricaded
that day, for a boatload of rebels was about to leave Barranquilla
to storm the city and seize, if possible, the customs.
When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.
Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported
the arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days
before? He seized his hat and left the room.</p>
<p>Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short
interview with the chief. Then that official despatched policemen
to the office of the steamship company, and to the dock.
Their orders were to arrest two Americans who were abducting
a young girl. They returned a half hour later with sheepish
faces. &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; they announced to their chief,
&ldquo;the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the Americans
and the girl aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a
tiger. Exacerbation succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave
way to a maddening thirst for sanguinary vengeance. He hastened
out and despatched a telegraphic message to Bogot&aacute;.
Then he returned to his study to await its effect.</p>
<p>Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal
authorities, stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of
soldiers marched over the unfrequented trail to Simit&iacute;, where
they arrived as night fell. Their orders were to take into
custody the priest, Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, who was accused of complicity
in the recent plot to overthrow the existing government.</p>
<p>At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North,
a young girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung
over the rail and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.
The tourists who saw her heterogeneous attire laughed. But
when they looked into her beautiful, sad face their mirth died,
and a tender pity stirred their hearts.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_1_1_1' id='CHAPTER_1_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
</div>
<p>The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor
with such exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late
in the raw fall afternoon, and revealed to the wondering
eyes of the girl who stood alone at the rail of the <i>Joachim</i> a
confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with myriad
points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the
gray pall. Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous
breathing of the metropolis. Clouds of heavy, black smoke
wreathed about the bay. Through it shrieking water craft
darted and wriggled in endless confusion. For two days the
port of New York had been a bedlam of raw sound, as the
great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their raucous
warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.
Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists,
and added bewilderment to the girl.</p>
<p>The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical
home had not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate
plunge. The convulsion which ensued from the culmination
of events long gathering about little Simit&iacute; had hurled her
through the forest, down the scalding river, and out upon the
tossing ocean with such swiftness that, as she now stood at
the portal of a new world, she seemed to be wandering through
the mazes of an intricate dream. During the ocean voyage she
had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as
she gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always
before her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore
herself from his arms in far-off Simit&iacute;; the other, that of the
dark-faced, white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river
bank at wretched Llano and watched her, with eager, straining
eyes, until the winding stream hid her from his earthly sight&ndash;&ndash;forever.
She wondered dully now why she had left them, why
she had so easily yielded to the influences which had caused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page4' name='book3_page4'></a>4</span>
the separation. They might have fled to the jungle and lived
there in safety and seclusion. The malign influences which
beset them all in Simit&iacute; never could have reached them in the
trackless forest. And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and
Jos&egrave; held out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of
a speedy reunion, she would not have yielded to the pressure
which they had exerted, and to the allurements of life in the
wonderful country to which they had sent her. Her embarrassment
on the boat was due largely to a sense of awkwardness
in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty. To be sure, the priest had often
shown her pictures of the women of the outside world, and
she had some idea of their dress. But that such a vast difference
existed between the illustrations and the actualities, she
had never for a moment imagined. Their gowns, their jewels,
their coiffures held her in open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.
Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed, remanded her to her
cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such manners.</p>
<p>Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage
conduced to Carmen&rsquo;s happiness. Mrs. Reed showed plainly
that the girl was an awkward embarrassment to her; that she
was tolerated because of reasons which pertained solely to her
husband&rsquo;s business; and she took pains to impress upon her
fellow-travelers that, in view of the perplexing servant problem,
this unmannered creature was being taken to the States
to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew! the training
would be arduous, and the result uncertain.</p>
<p>Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.
Harris alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.
He walked the deck with her, regardless of the smiles of the
other passengers. He taught her to play shuffle-board, checkers,
and simple card games. He conducted her over the boat
and explained the intricate machinery and the numberless
wonders of the great craft. He sat with her out on the deck
at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps. And at the table he insisted that she occupy
the seat next to him, despite the protestations of the chief
steward, who would have placed her apart with the servants.</p>
<p>Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal
which, though mute, he nevertheless understood. At
Kingston he took her on a drive through the town, and bought
post cards for her to send back to Jos&egrave; and Rosendo. It consoled
her immeasurably when he glowingly recounted the
pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving these
cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the preparation
of additional ones to be posted in New York.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page5' name='book3_page5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the
stalled craft to gain the harbor entrance. The enforced retention
of the vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in
docking, and the <i>Joachim</i> was assigned to a pier not her own.
The captain grumbled, but had no choice. At the pier opposite
there docked a huge liner from Havre; and the two boats
poured their swarming human freight into the same shed.
When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving
a little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some
friends with a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.
She rushed joyfully into their arms, while Reed hastened to
his equipage with a customs officer.</p>
<p>But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the
great crowd in the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly
remembered that he had left a bundle of Panam&aacute; hats underneath
his bunk. Dropping the girl&rsquo;s hand, the impetuous
fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the boat.</p>
<p>For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself
against the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to
the small, paper-wrapped bundle which she carried. Her first
impulse was to follow Harris. But the eager, belated crowd
almost swept her off her feet, and she turned again, drifting
slowly with it toward the distant exit. As she moved uncertainly,
struggling the while to prevent being crushed against
the wall, she felt some one grasp her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are!&rdquo; sounded a gentle voice close to her
ear. &ldquo;Well, how fortunate! We thought we had lost you!
Come, they are waiting for us up ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked up at the speaker. It was a woman, comely
of feature, and strikingly well dressed. The girl thought her
beautiful. The anxious fears of a moment before vanished.
&ldquo;Is he up there&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Reed?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He? Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Reed and the others are waiting for us.
They sent me back to find you. The automobiles came for you
all; but I presume the others have gone by this time. However,
you and I will follow in mine. I am Auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His aunt?&rdquo; the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a
way for them through the mass of humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. And I am so glad to see you. I have heard all
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he write to you&ndash;&ndash;from Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, long letters. And he told all about his little girl. He
said your name was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness,
for here was one woman who did not avoid her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page6' name='book3_page6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Carmen. It is a sweet name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Harris!&rdquo; cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she
remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he wait? Well, he will come. He knows where
to find the automobiles. I will leave word with the pier-master
to tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd
and gained the street. The woman, still retaining Carmen&rsquo;s
hand, went directly to a waiting automobile and pushed the
unresisting girl through the open door. Carmen had never
seen a conveyance like this, and her thought was instantly
absorbed. She looked wonderingly for the horses. And then,
sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.</p>
<p>As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman,
who had been eying the party since they came out of the
shed, stepped up and laid a hand on the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&ndash;&ndash;little girl,&rdquo; he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
&ldquo;<i>you&ndash;&ndash;you know this lady, do you</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the
woman&rsquo;s smiling face. &ldquo;She is Auntie, Mr. Reed&rsquo;s aunt.&rdquo; She
thought his blue uniform and shining buttons and star gorgeously
beautiful.</p>
<p>The officer stood hesitant a moment. Suspicion lurked in
his eyes as he looked at the woman and then back again at
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a little girl who came up from the South with my
nephew, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; the woman explained easily. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
wonder you asked. I will give you my card, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her air was supremely confident. The chauffeur, too, as he
got out and leisurely examined his engine, served further to
disarm suspicion. The officer raised up and removed his hand
from the machine. The chauffeur slowly mounted the box and
threw on his lever. As the car moved gently into the night the
officer glanced at its number. &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he muttered, turning
away. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? The number would be changed anyway.
What&rsquo;s a fellow going to do in a case like this, I&rsquo;d like
to know&ndash;&ndash;go with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed
by Reed and his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you looking for?&rdquo; asked the officer, planting himself
in front of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl!&rdquo; sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long
arms pawing the air. &ldquo;Girl&ndash;&ndash;so high&ndash;&ndash;funny dress&ndash;&ndash;big straw
hat! Seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer gasped. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone! Aunt took her just now
in an auto!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page7' name='book3_page7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt!&rdquo; yelled Harris. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got no aunt! She&rsquo;s from the
jungle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Officer,&rdquo; said Reed, interposing. &ldquo;My
name&rsquo;s Reed. The girl came up from South America with me.
Describe the woman&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed!&rdquo; cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Said she was your aunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Harry! You great, blundering boob!&rdquo; cried the distracted
Harris, menacing the confused officer. &ldquo;And you let
her nab the kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around
the excited, noisy group. Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and
hustled the bewildered officer into it. &ldquo;You, Harris, get the
women folks home, and wait for me! I&rsquo;ll go to central with
this officer and report the case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; exclaimed Harris wildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to visit every
dance hall and dive in this bloomin&rsquo; town before I go home!
I&rsquo;m going to find that girl! And you, you blithering idiot,&rdquo;
shaking a fist at the officer, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to lose your star
for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft
cushions, sped through the dusk like a fell spirit. A confused
jumble of shadows flew past, and strange, unfamiliar noises
rose from the animated streets. The lights shimmered on the
moist glass. It was confusing. The girl ceased trying to read
any meaning in it. It all fused into a blur; and she closed her
eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations stimulated by
her first ride in a carriage propelled&ndash;&ndash;she knew not how.</p>
<p>At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and
the big car rolled up against a curb and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are home now,&rdquo; said the woman softly, as she descended
and again took Carmen&rsquo;s hand. They hurriedly
mounted the white stone steps of a tall, gloomy building and
entered a door that seemed to open noiselessly at their approach.
A glare of light burst upon the blinking eyes of the
girl. A negro woman softly closed the door after them. With
a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her. In the room
at her right she caught a glimpse of women&ndash;&ndash;beautiful, they
seemed to her&ndash;&ndash;clad in loose, low-cut, gaily colored gowns.
There were men there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing
sprightly music. She had seen pianos like that in Cartagena,
and on the boat, and they had seemed to her things bewitched.
In the room at the end of the hall men and women were dancing
on a floor that seemed of polished glass. Loud talk, laughter,
and singing floated through the rooms, and the air was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page8' name='book3_page8'></a>8</span>
warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume. The odor reminded
her of the roses in her own little garden in Simit&iacute;. It was all
beautiful, wonderful, fairy-like.</p>
<p>But she had only a moment for this appraisal. Seizing her
hand again, the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs
before them and into a warm, light room. Then, without
speaking, she went out and closed the door, leaving the girl
alone.</p>
<p>Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and
tried to grasp it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.
So this was his home, Mr. Reed&rsquo;s. It was a palace! Like those
Jos&egrave; had described. She wondered if Harris dwelt in a place
of such heavenly beauty; for he had said that he did not live
with Reed. What would the stupid people of Simit&iacute; think
could they see her now! She had never dreamed that such
marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty,
little home town! Jos&egrave; had told her much, ah, wonderful
things! And so had Harris. But how pitifully inadequate now
seemed all their stories! She still wondered what had made
that carriage go in which she had come up from the boat.
And what would one like it cost? Would her interest in La
Libertad suffice to buy one? She speculated vaguely.</p>
<p>Then she rose and wandered about the room. She passed
her hand over the clean, white counterpane of the bed. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
she murmured, &ldquo;how beautiful!&rdquo; She went dreamily to the
bureau and took up, one by one, the toilet articles that lay
there in neat array. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; she murmured, again and
again. She glanced into the clear mirror. The little figure
reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously beautiful
ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud. Then
she went to the window and felt of the soft curtains. &ldquo;It is
heaven,&rdquo; she murmured, facing about and sweeping the room,
&ldquo;just heaven! Oh, how beautiful even the human mind can
be! I never thought it, I never thought it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up
to the charm of her surroundings. Her glance fell upon a vase
of flowers that stood on a table near another window. She
rose and went to them, bending over to inhale their fragrance.
&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she felt them crackle in her
fingers. Poor child, they were artificial! But she would learn,
ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life of the great city
in which she was now adrift.</p>
<p>Time passed. She began to wonder why the woman did
not return. Were not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe
arrival? But perhaps they had visitors. Surely that was the
case. It was a ball&ndash;&ndash;but so different from the simple, artless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page9' name='book3_page9'></a>9</span>
<i>baile</i> of her native town. Stray snatches of music drifted into
the room from the piano below. It stimulated a hunger for
more. She went to the door, thinking to open it a little and
listen. The door was locked!</p>
<p>For a moment she stood reflecting. Then apprehension began
to steal over her. She went hastily, instinctively, to a
window and raised the curtain. There were iron bars in front
of it! She remembered suddenly that prison windows were
like that. She hurried to the other. It was likewise barred.
Terror&rsquo;s clammy hand gripped at her heart. Then she caught
herself&ndash;&ndash;and laughed. &ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; she exclaimed, sinking
again into the rocker. &ldquo;God is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman
entered. She was younger than the one who had met the boat.
When she saw the girl she uttered an exclamation. &ldquo;Lord!
where did you get those clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled
up at the woman. &ldquo;Cartagena,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Mrs. Reed
bought them for me. But are you her sister? You don&rsquo;t look
like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh. The dry
cosmetic plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked. She was not
beautiful like the others, thought Carmen. Her cheeks were
sunken, and her low-cut gown revealed great, protruding collarbones.
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;get out of those rags and
into something modern.&rdquo; She opened a closet door and selected
a gown from a number hanging there. It was white, and there
was a gay ribbon at the waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be pinned up,&rdquo; she commented to herself,
holding it out before her and regarding Carmen critically.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes danced. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;am I to
wear that? How beautiful! Did Mrs. Reed give it to me? And
is there a party down stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau
drawer and took from it several other garments, which she
threw upon a chair, together with the dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the whole lot of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; she said sharply, indicating
the garments. &ldquo;And move lively, for supper&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; and
there&rsquo;ll be callers soon&ndash;&ndash;gentlemen callers,&rdquo; she added, smiling
grimly.</p>
<p>She turned and faced Carmen. Their eyes met. The
woman stopped abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding
the girl. Carmen gazed up at her with a smile of
happy, trustful assurance.</p>
<p>The woman was the first to speak. &ldquo;Where did you come
from?&rdquo; she demanded hoarsely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page10' name='book3_page10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>Carmen told her. She mentioned Simit&iacute;, Padre Jos&egrave;, and
Rosendo. Her voice quavered a little; but she brightened up
and concluded: &ldquo;And Mr. Reed&rsquo;s Auntie, she met us&ndash;&ndash;that is,
me. Oh, isn&rsquo;t she a beautiful lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child&rsquo;s gaze.
Then, suddenly, as if something had given way under great
strain, she cried: &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t look at me that way!
Who are you?&rdquo; She dropped into a chair and continued to
stare at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve told you,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued,
going quickly to the woman and taking her hand,
&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t told me your name yet. And we are going to be
such good friends, aren&rsquo;t we? Yes, we are. And you are going
to tell me all about this beautiful house, and that wonderful
carriage I came here in. What did make it go, anyway? Do
you ride often? Oh, I hope Mrs. Reed will take me out in it
every day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s hand tightened over Carmen&rsquo;s. She seemed
to struggle with herself. Then, in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&ndash;&ndash;is she living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madre Maria is,&rdquo; returned Carmen. &ldquo;But my mother, my
own real mother, she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the
great river. My father left her, and she was trying to follow
him. Then I was born&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same old story!&rdquo; muttered the woman fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been there, girl, and know all about it. I followed the man&ndash;&ndash;but
it was my kid that died! God, if I could have laid my hands
on him! And now you have come here&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard. Carmen gently
stole an arm about her neck. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; she murmured,
laying her soft cheek against the woman&rsquo;s painted one. &ldquo;No
one can desert us or harm us, for <i>God is everywhere</i>. And no
one really dies. We have got to know that. Padre Jos&egrave; said
I had a message for the people up here; and now you are the
first one I&rsquo;ve told it to. But that&rsquo;s it: God is everywhere. And
if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us. But
you didn&rsquo;t know it when your husband left you, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Husband!&rdquo; ejaculated the woman. Then she looked up
into the girl&rsquo;s deep, wondering eyes and checked herself.
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said abruptly, rising and still holding her hand.
&ldquo;Never mind the clothes.&rdquo; A grim look settled over her features.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down to supper now as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s companion led her down the stairs and through
the hall to a brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a
long table sat a half dozen women. There were places for as
many more, but they were unoccupied. The cloth was white,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page11' name='book3_page11'></a>11</span>
the glass shone, the silver sparkled. And the women, who
glanced up at the girl, were clad in gowns of such gorgeous
hues as to make the child gasp in amazement. Over all hung
the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.</p>
<p>The noisy chatter at once ceased. The woman led her to a
chair next to the one she herself took. Carmen looked around
for the lady who had met her at the boat. She was not there.
The silence and the steady scrutiny of the others began to
embarrass her. &ldquo;Where&ndash;&ndash;where is Auntie?&rdquo; she asked timidly,
looking up at her faded attendant.</p>
<p>A titter ran around the table. One of the women, who
swayed slightly in her chair, looked up stupidly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
Auntie?&rdquo; she muttered thickly. A burst of laughter followed
this remark, and Carmen sat down in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Madam, Jude?&rdquo; asked one of the younger
women of Carmen&rsquo;s attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dining alone in her room. Headache,&rdquo; was the laconic
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She landed a queen this time, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; looking admiringly
at Carmen. &ldquo;Gets me, how the old girl does it!
What&rsquo;s your name, kiddo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly
about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good handle. But what&rsquo;s the rest?&rdquo; put in another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen Ariza,&rdquo; the child amended, as her big, wondering
eyes swept the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s a moniker for you!&rdquo; laughed one. &ldquo;Where
do you hail from, angel-face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your home, you know. I see your finish, all right. But
where&rsquo;d you begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them where you lived, child,&rdquo; said the woman called
Jude in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; replied Carmen, tears choking her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;!&rdquo; echoed around the table. &ldquo;New York? Ohio?
Or Kansas?&rdquo; A burst of mirth punctuated the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the women vote there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Simit&iacute;, kidlet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, &ldquo;South
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table,
while the women sat regarding the girl curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Carmen in a trembling voice, &ldquo;where is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page12' name='book3_page12'></a>12</span>
Mrs. Reed? And isn&rsquo;t Mr. Harris here? Why don&rsquo;t they come?
Don&rsquo;t they know I am here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked appealingly from one to another. Her beautiful
face wore such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and
helplessness as to throw a hush upon the room. One of the
women rose. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; She
looked for a moment uncertainly into the big, deep eyes of the
girl, and then turned and hastily left the room.</p>
<p>The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted
creature at the end of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an old devil the Madam is! My God! One look
into those eyes would have been enough for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, Jude?&rdquo; asked another, nodding toward
the girl. &ldquo;Does she stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman addressed as Jude shook her head. &ldquo;This is
only a recruiting station for the regular army. She&rsquo;ll go over
to French Lucy&rsquo;s; and the Madam will get a round price for
the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Lucy&rsquo;ll get rich off of her! But she needs the money.
Ames owns her house, too, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus
of her wine. &ldquo;He owns every house in this block, they say.
Got long leases for &rsquo;em all. And the rents&ndash;&ndash;suffering Moses!
The Madam rolls on the floor and cusses for a week straight
every time she pays hers. But just the same, if you&rsquo;ve ever
noticed, the houses that Ames owns are never raided by the
coppers. Ames whacks up with the mayor and the city hall
gang and the chief of police. That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents. But it&rsquo;s a lot better&rsquo;n being swooped
down on by the cops every few weeks, ain&rsquo;t it? We know
what we&rsquo;re expected to pay, that way. And we never do when
we keep handin&rsquo; it out to the cops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; approved some one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is. That&rsquo;s what the collector says. And he&rsquo;s
got a new collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.
They&rsquo;re the old man&rsquo;s agents now for his dive-houses. He can&rsquo;t
get anybody else to handle &rsquo;em, so the collector tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle Carey&rsquo;s place was pulled last night, I hear,&rdquo; said
one of the women, pushing back her plate and lighting a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Jude, &ldquo;and why? Cause the house is owned
by Gannette&ndash;&ndash;swell guy livin&rsquo; up on Riverside Drive&ndash;&ndash;and he
don&rsquo;t divvy with the city hall. Belle don&rsquo;t pay no such rent as
the Madam does&ndash;&ndash;at least so old Lucy tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred
their laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page13' name='book3_page13'></a>13</span>
&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Lucy&ndash;&ndash;huh! Used to work for her m&rsquo;self. Caught a
pippin for her once&ndash;&ndash;right off the train&ndash;&ndash;jus&rsquo; like this li&rsquo;l
hussy. Went to th&rsquo; depot in a hack. Saw th&rsquo; li&rsquo;l kid comin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; pretended to faint. Li&rsquo;l kid run to me an&rsquo; asked could
she help. Got her to see me safe home&ndash;&ndash;tee! hee! She&rsquo;s
workin&rsquo; f&rsquo;r ol&rsquo; Lucy yet, sound&rsquo;s a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back
into her former state of sodden stupidity.</p>
<p>The girl rose hastily from her chair. The policeman&rsquo;s
words at the pier were floating confusedly through her thought.
The strange talk of these women increased the confusion. Perhaps
a mistake had been made. She turned beseechingly to
Jude. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Reed&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the nerve for another sob-scene,&rdquo; she commented
as she went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I? Where am I?&rdquo; pleaded Carmen, turning
from one to another.</p>
<p>Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly. &ldquo;Pleasant
job for me!&rdquo; she commented ironically, looking at the others.
Then, to Carmen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in a&ndash;&ndash;a hotel,&rdquo; she said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;then it was a mistake?&rdquo; The girl turned her
great, yearning eyes upon the woman. Jude shrank under
them. &ldquo;Sit down, and finish your supper,&rdquo; she said harshly,
pulling the girl toward the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Carmen loudly. &ldquo;You must take me to Mr.
Reed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly. The
negro waitress went quickly out and closed the door. Jude
rose, still holding the girl&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Come up stairs with me,&rdquo;
she said, leading her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Jude!&rdquo; commented one of the women, when the
two had left the room. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s about all in. This sort of business
is getting her nerve. But she&rsquo;s housekeeper, and that&rsquo;s
part of her job. And&ndash;&ndash;the poor little kid! But ain&rsquo;t she a
beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.
Then she sank wearily into a chair. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sick of this&ndash;&ndash;sick of the whole thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen went quickly to her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
It was all a mistake, and we can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; echoed the woman bitterly. &ldquo;Where&ndash;&ndash;and how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you said this was a hotel&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hotel! God, it&rsquo;s hell! And you are in forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression
on her face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page14' name='book3_page14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; said Jude, bracing herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something
to tell you. You have been&ndash;&ndash;good God! I can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t!
For God&rsquo;s sake, child, don&rsquo;t look at me that way! Who are
you? Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; replied Carmen quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.
But if you did, and if you believe in a God, you had better pray
to Him now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I am not afraid. God is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;right here.
I was afraid&ndash;&ndash;a little&ndash;&ndash;at first. But not now. When we stop
and just know that we love everybody, and that everybody
really loves us, why, we can&rsquo;t be afraid any more, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.
Love! That warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to
her. And God&ndash;&ndash;it was only a convenient execrative. But&ndash;&ndash;what
was it that looked out from that strange girl&rsquo;s eyes?
What was it that held her fascinated there? What was emerging
from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?
Whence came that beautiful, white life that she was going to
blast? And could she, after all? Then what stayed her now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she cried sharply, &ldquo;tell me again all about
yourself, and about your friends and family down south, and
what it was that the Madam said to you! And be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went
again over the story. As the child talked, the woman&rsquo;s hard
eyes widened, and now and then a big tear rolled down the
painted cheek. Her thought began to stray back, far back,
along the wreck-strewn path over which she herself had come.
At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New England
farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected, trudging
behind the plow. In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering
over her little household like a benediction. Then night
fell, swiftly as the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she
awoke from a terrible dream, stained, abandoned, lost&ndash;&ndash;and
seared with a foul oath to drag down to her own level every
innocent girl upon whom her hands might thereafter fall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have just had to know,&rdquo; Carmen concluded, &ldquo;every
minute since I left Simit&iacute;, that God was everywhere, and that
He would not let any harm come to me. But when we really
know that, why, the way <i>always</i> opens. For that&rsquo;s prayer,
right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter
blankness upon her pallid face. Prayer! Oh, yes, she had
been taught to pray. Well she remembered, though the memory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page15' name='book3_page15'></a>15</span>
now cut like a knife, how she knelt at her beautiful
mother&rsquo;s knee and asked the good Father to bless and protect
them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged to her little
bosom. But God had never heard her petitions, innocent though
she was. And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!</p>
<p>A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose
from below. The woman sprang to the door and stood listening.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boys from the college!&rdquo; she cried in a hoarse
whisper.</p>
<p>She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving
to formulate a plan. A look of fierce determination came into
her face. She went to the bureau and took from the drawers
several articles, which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her
dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low,
strained voice, &ldquo;you do just as I say. Bring your bundle. And
for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with
Carmen and locked the door after her. Then, bidding the girl
wait, she slipped softly down the hall and locked the door of
the room to which the girl had first been taken. Both keys she
dropped into her pocket. &ldquo;Now follow me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the
clink of glasses. The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco
smoke. A door near them opened, and a sound of voices
issued. The woman pulled Carmen into a closet until the hall
was again quiet. Then she hurried on to another door which
she entered, dragging the girl with her. Again she locked the
door after her. Groping through the darkness, she reached
a window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured
with a padlock. The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened
this. Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond,
she bade the girl precede her cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire-escape,&rdquo; she explained briefly. She reached
through the window grating and fastened the padlock; then
closed the window; and quickly descended with the girl to the
ground below.</p>
<p>Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen&rsquo;s
hand and crept swiftly around the big house and into a dark
alley. There she stopped to throw over her shoulders a light
shawl which she had taken from the bureau. Then she hurried
on.</p>
<p>Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.
When they emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.
The air was chill, and the thinly clad woman shivered. Carmen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page16' name='book3_page16'></a>16</span>
fresh from the tropics, felt the contrast keenly. A few
moments&rsquo; rapid walking down the street brought them to a
large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high board
fence. The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the
door, over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen
read, &ldquo;The Little Sisters of the Poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon
the Sister Superior. Carmen marveled at her strange attire.
A moment later they were silently ushered into an adjoining
room, where a tall woman, similarly dressed, awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Jude excitedly, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a little kid&ndash;&ndash;you got
to care for her until she finds her friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the
woman. &ldquo;Let the child wait here a moment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
you come with me and tell your story. It would be better that
she should not hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little while they appeared again. Carmen was drowsing
in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s chock full of religion,&rdquo; the woman was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; the Sister replied, &ldquo;what will you do? Go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, no!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;They would murder me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will stay here until&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I have friends&ndash;&ndash;others like myself&ndash;&ndash;I will go to
them. I&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&rsquo;t stay here&ndash;&ndash;with her,&rdquo; nodding toward the
girl. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you will take care of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; returned the Sister in a calm voice.</p>
<p>Jude looked at Carmen for a moment. She made as if she
would speak. Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out
into the chill night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand. &ldquo;Poor
little thing!&rdquo; she murmured as they mounted the stairs. &ldquo;Poor
little thing!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
</div>
<p>Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell
sounded its shrill summons through the long corridors.
When she opened her eyes she gazed at the ceiling above in
perplexity. She still seemed to feel the tossing motion of the
boat, and half believed the bell to be the call to the table, where
she should again hear the cheery voice of Harris and meet the
tolerant smile of Mrs. Reed. Then a rush of memories swept
her, and her heart went down in the flood. She was alone in a
great foreign city! She turned her face to the pillow, and for
a moment a sob shook her. Then she reached under the pillow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page17' name='book3_page17'></a>17</span>
and drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her
bundle and placed there when the Sister left her the night
before. The book fell open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and
will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee
for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She snapped the book shut and quickly rose. &ldquo;That means
me,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave; said I had a message for
the world; and now I am to tell it to these people up here.
God has called me in righteousness. That means, He has called
me to do <i>right thinking</i>. And I am to tell these people how
to think right. They don&rsquo;t know as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the
sturdy little lad who had so proudly claimed the name of
Rinc&oacute;n. For a moment she stood still. Then she burst into
tears and threw herself back upon the bed.</p>
<p>But she did not lie there long. &ldquo;I must think only God&rsquo;s
thoughts,&rdquo; she said, struggling to her feet and checking her
grief. &ldquo;If it is right for the little boy to be his son, then I must
want it to be so. I <i>must</i> want only the right&ndash;&ndash;I have <i>got</i> to
want it! And if it is not right now, then God will make it so.
It is all in His hands, and I must not think of it any more,
unless I think right thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes.
&ldquo;I simply can not wear these things,&rdquo; she mourned, looking at
them dubiously; &ldquo;and I do not believe the woman will make
me. I wonder why the other woman called her Sister. Why
did she wear that ugly black bonnet? And why was I hurried
away from that hotel? It was so much pleasanter there, so
bright and warm; and here it is so cold.&rdquo; She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I have
got to go out now and find Mr. Reed and Mr. Harris&ndash;&ndash;I have
just <i>got</i> to find them&ndash;&ndash;and to-day! But, oh, this city is so
much larger than Simit&iacute;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back
again in the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad
and her mother&rsquo;s little locket, which Rosendo had given her
that last morning in Simit&iacute;. The latter she drew out and regarded
wistfully for some moments. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any father or
mother but God,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But He is both father and
mother to me now.&rdquo; With a little sigh she tied up the bundle
again. Holding it in one hand and carrying the much despised
shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.</p>
<p>When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page18' name='book3_page18'></a>18</span>
she stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Anita&rsquo;s babe!&rdquo; she exclaimed half-aloud.
&ldquo;I have been thinking only of myself. It is <i>not</i> blind!
It sees! It sees as God sees! What is it that the Bible says?&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;And
I will bring them by a way that they knew not; I will
lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.&rsquo; I
must know that&ndash;&ndash;always! And Padre Jos&egrave; said he would remember
it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the
remembrance of the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended
the stairs, murmuring at every step, &ldquo;God is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;right
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open
door, a number of elderly people sitting at long tables. Toward
them she made her way. When she reached the door,
she stopped and peered curiously within. A murmur of astonishment
rose from the inmates when they caught sight of the
quaint object in the doorway, standing uncertainly, with her
shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in the other,
and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for her in
Cartagena.</p>
<p>A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl&rsquo;s hand,
led her into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister
Superior at breakfast. The latter greeted the child gently and
bade her be seated at the table. Carmen dropped into a chair
and sat staring in na&iuml;ve wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began the Sister at length, &ldquo;eat your breakfast
quickly. This is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in
the chapel in half an hour. You look frightened. I don&rsquo;t
wonder. But you are with friends here, little girl. What is
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble
tongue its wonted flexibility. Without further invitation or
preface she entered at once upon a lively description of her
wonderful journey through the jungle, the subsequent ocean
voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded with the
cryptical remark: &ldquo;And, you know, Se&ntilde;ora, it is all just as
Padre Jos&egrave; said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child. What manner
of being was this that had been so strangely wafted into
these sacred precincts on the night breeze! The abandoned
woman who had brought her there, the Sister remembered,
had dropped an equally cryptical remark&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s chock full of
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page19' name='book3_page19'></a>19</span>
pondering the child&rsquo;s dramatic recital, murmured a sincere,
&ldquo;The Virgin be praised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the
words, &ldquo;you people up here talk just like those in Simit&iacute;. But
Padre Jos&egrave; said you didn&rsquo;t know, either. You ought to, though,
for you have had so many more ad&ndash;&ndash;advantages than we have.
Se&ntilde;ora, there are many big, clumsy words in the English language,
aren&rsquo;t there? But I love it just the same. So did Padre
Jos&egrave;. We used to speak it all the time during the last years
we were together. He said it seemed easier to talk about God
in that language than in any other. Do you find it so,
Se&ntilde;ora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, child?&rdquo; asked the puzzled Sister.
&ldquo;And who is this Jos&egrave; that you talk so much about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;taught me&ndash;&ndash;in Simit&iacute;. He is the priest there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the Sister warmly, &ldquo;he seems to have taught
you queer things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned Carmen quickly, &ldquo;he just taught me
the truth. He didn&rsquo;t tell me about the queer things in the
world, for he said they were not real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.
But the child&rsquo;s thought had strayed to other topics. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
cold up here!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress
about her. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to put on these shoes to keep
my feet warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, child, put them on!&rdquo; exclaimed the Sister.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you wear shoes in your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wear much of anything, it was so warm. Oh, it is
beautiful down there, Se&ntilde;ora, so beautiful and warm in Simit&iacute;!&rdquo;
She sighed, and her eyes filled with tears. But she brushed
them away and smiled bravely up at the Sister. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come
here because it is right,&rdquo; she said with a firm nod of her head.
&ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave; said I had a message for you. He said you didn&rsquo;t
know much about God up here. Why, I don&rsquo;t know much of
anything else!&rdquo; She laughed a happy little laugh as she said
this. Then she went on briskly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Se&ntilde;ora, Padre Jos&egrave; isn&rsquo;t really a priest. But
he said he had to stay in the Church in order to teach me. I
never could understand why. I am sure he just thought wrong
about it. But, anyway, he will not have to be a priest any
more, now that I have gone, will he? You know, Don Jorge
said priests were a bad lot; but that isn&rsquo;t so, for there are many
good priests, aren&rsquo;t there? Yes, there are. Only, they don&rsquo;t
understand, either. Why, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly
remembering the Sister&rsquo;s previous injunction, &ldquo;is this a church?
You said there would be Mass in the chapel&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page20' name='book3_page20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively,
while her manner became more severe; &ldquo;this is a home for old
people, a charitable institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that
meant. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; her face alight and her eyes dancing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
belong here then, do I? I am never going to be old,&rdquo; she meditated.
&ldquo;Why, God never grows old! And we are His children,
you know. The Bible says we are made in His image and likeness.
Well, if that is so, how can we ever grow old? Just think
of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane and saying:
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m getting old now! I&rsquo;ll soon be dying!&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that
awful! We wouldn&rsquo;t grow old and die if it wasn&rsquo;t for our
wrong way of thinking, would we? When we think His
thoughts, why, we will be like Him. But not until then. Padre
Jos&egrave; says this, and he knows it is true&ndash;&ndash;only, he seems to have
a hard time proving it. But, Se&ntilde;ora, we have all got to prove
it, some time, every one of us. And then there will not be any
places like this for old people&ndash;&ndash;people who still believe that
two and two are seven, you know. And that&rsquo;s my message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on.
&ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave; sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out
in the world, and he always said that charity was a crime
against the people. And he was right, for that is just the way
Jesus looked at it, isn&rsquo;t it? Jesus did not give money to beggars,
but he did better, he healed them of the bad state of mind
that was making them poor and sick. Why don&rsquo;t the priests
do that? Can you heal the sick? Jesus, when he taught, first
said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.
Now do you do that? I try to. I&rsquo;ve tried it all my life. And,
why, Se&ntilde;ora, I&rsquo;ve had thousands of proofs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert
glance at her, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Se&ntilde;ora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor
as it is to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex&ndash;&ndash;the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not
from God; and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them
real is to believe in power apart from God. It is having other
gods than the one God; and that is breaking the very first
Commandment, isn&rsquo;t it? Yes, it is; and you can prove it, just
as you can prove the principles in mathematics. Se&ntilde;ora, do
you know anything about mathematics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; cried the enthusiastic girl, &ldquo;the things that
Jesus taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules
in mathematics! Why not? for they are truth, and all truth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page21' name='book3_page21'></a>21</span>
can be demonstrated, you know. You know, Se&ntilde;ora, God is
everywhere&ndash;&ndash;not only in heaven, but right here where we are.
Heaven, Padre Jos&egrave; used to say so often, is only a perfect state
of mind; and so it is, isn&rsquo;t it? God, you know, is mind. And
when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we will be in heaven.
Isn&rsquo;t it simple? But,&rdquo; she went on after catching her breath,
&ldquo;we can&rsquo;t reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be real and
powerful. Evil isn&rsquo;t anything. It is just zero, nothing&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that before,&rdquo; interrupted the woman, recovering
somewhat from her surprise. &ldquo;But I think that before you
get out of New York you will reverse that idea. There&rsquo;s a
pretty fair amount of evil here, and it is quite real, we find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Carmen. &ldquo;If it is real, then God made
it. It seems real to you&ndash;&ndash;but that is only because you give it
reality in your consciousness. You believe it real, and so it
becomes to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the woman dryly, &ldquo;on that basis I think the
same may be said of good, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Carmen eagerly, &ldquo;good is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory
hand, &ldquo;we are not going to discuss the foolish theological
notions which that fallen priest put into your poor little
head. Finish your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child looked at the woman in mute protest. Jos&egrave; a
fallen priest! Would these people up here so regard him? It
was a new thought, and one that she would not accept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; she began again, after a brief interval, &ldquo;Padre
Jos&egrave; is a good man, even the human Padre Jos&egrave;. And he is
trying to solve his problem and know God. And he is trying
to know himself, not as other people think they know him, but
as God knows him, and as I have always tried to know him.
You have no right to judge him&ndash;&ndash;and, anyway, you are not
judging him, but only your wrong idea of him. And that,&rdquo; she
said softly, &ldquo;is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister did not answer. She was beginning to feel the
spell of those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the
sparkling expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance
that bubbled from those red lips. And she was losing herself
in contemplation of the girl&rsquo;s luxuriant beauty, whose rich
profusion her strange, foreign attire could not disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; said Carmen suddenly, &ldquo;the people on the boat
laughed at my clothes. But I don&rsquo;t think them half as funny
as that great black bonnet you are wearing. Why do you
wear it? I never saw one until I was brought here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense. But
the woman instantly roused from her meditation and assumed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page22' name='book3_page22'></a>22</span>
an attitude of severe dignity. &ldquo;Finish your breakfast,&rdquo; she
commanded sharply. &ldquo;And remember after this that children&rsquo;s
manners here are not those of your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in
silence. As they were rising from the table a cheery voice
came from the outer room, and presently a priest looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Sister,&rdquo; he cried heartily. &ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo; as his eyes fell upon Carmen. He was a young man, apparently
still in the twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather
to stoutness, and with a round, shining face that radiated health
and good nature.</p>
<p>The Sister quietly returned his cordial greeting. &ldquo;It is a
little waif,&rdquo; she said in answer to his query, &ldquo;who strayed in
here last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;another derelict! And will you
send her to the orphanage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the
other children,&rdquo; replied the Sister. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she continued
seriously, &ldquo;I want you to examine this child, and then tell me
what you think should be done with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it&ndash;&ndash;health?&rdquo; asked the priest, studying the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Sister; &ldquo;but another priest has gone
wrong, and this,&rdquo; pointing to Carmen, &ldquo;is the result of his
pernicious teachings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest did not reply for some moments. Then he
sighed wearily. &ldquo;Very well, Sister,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
&ldquo;I will talk with her after the service.&rdquo; He seemed suddenly to
have lost his cheerfulness, as he continued to converse with the
woman on matters pertaining to the institution.</p>
<p>Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned
to her in the chapel and sat quietly through the service. She
had often seen Jos&egrave; celebrate Mass in the rude little church in
Simit&iacute;, but with no such elaboration as she witnessed here.
Once or twice she joined in the responses, not with any thought
of worship, but rather to give vent, even if slight, to the impelling
desire to hear her own musical voice. She thought as
she did so that the priest looked in her direction. She thought
others looked at her attentively at the same time. But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused
and embarrassed under their searching scrutiny. Yet the old
people attracted her peculiarly. Never had she seen so many
at one time. And never, she thought, had she seen such physical
decrepitude and helplessness. And then she fell to wondering
what they were all there for, and what they got out of
the service. Did the Mass mean anything to them? Did they
believe that thereby their sins were atoned? Did they believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page23' name='book3_page23'></a>23</span>
that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine into
flesh and blood? She recalled much that Jos&egrave; had told her about
the people up in the States. They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.</p>
<p>The Host had been elevated. The people, still gossiping
cheerfully, had prostrated themselves before it. The sermon
had been short, for the old people waxed impatient at long
discourses. Then the priest descended from the pulpit and
came to Carmen. &ldquo;Now, little girl,&rdquo; he said, seating himself
beside her, &ldquo;tell me all about yourself, who you are, where
you come from, and what you have been taught. And do not
be afraid. I am your friend.&rdquo; Carmen smiled up at him; then
plunged into her narrative.</p>
<p>It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in
and saw the priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation.
She stood listening. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she heard the priest say, &ldquo;you tell
me that this Father Jos&egrave; taught you these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He taught me English, and French, and German. He
taught me mathematics. And he taught me all I know of
history, and of the world,&rdquo; the girl replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the priest went on hurriedly; &ldquo;but these other
things, these religious and philosophical notions, who taught
you these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.</p>
<p>The girl looked down as she answered softly, &ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast. He reached out
and laid a hand on hers. &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; he said, in a voice
scarcely audible. &ldquo;I believe you&ndash;&ndash;for we do not teach such
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up with luminous eyes. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said
quizzically, &ldquo;you are not really a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Waite!&rdquo; The Sister&rsquo;s voice rang sternly through
the quiet chapel. The priest started to his feet in confusion.
&ldquo;The dinner-bell will ring in a few minutes,&rdquo; continued the
Sister, regarding the man severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock.
&ldquo;The time passed so rapidly&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;this girl&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the girl to me,&rdquo; replied the Sister coldly. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;you consider her deranged. Coming from that hot
country suddenly into this cold climate might&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted the priest hastily; &ldquo;she seems uncommonly
strong mentally. She has some notions that are a&ndash;&ndash;somewhat
different from ours&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;but I will come and
have a further talk with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister
bowed her head stiffly. Then, as if loath to take his eyes from
the girl, he turned and went slowly out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page24' name='book3_page24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the woman sharply. Carmen followed her
out into the hall and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine,&rdquo; said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, &ldquo;put this girl to work. Let her eat with you and
sleep in your room. And see if you can&rsquo;t work some of the
foolish notions out of her head.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get some o&rsquo; th&rsquo; foolish notions out of your head, is it?
Och, puir bairn, wid yer swate face an&rsquo; that hivenly
hair, it&rsquo;s welcome ye air to yer notions! But, hist! Ye
have talked too brash to the Sister Superior. Ye air that innocent,
puir thing! But, mind your tongue, honey. Tell your
funny notions to old Katie, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll be safe as the soul of
Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Se&ntilde;ora, don&rsquo;t they want to know the truth up here?&rdquo;
There was a note of appeal in the quavering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, honey; don&rsquo;t call me sich heathen names.
Call me Sister. I&rsquo;m no Se&ntilde;ora, whativer that may be. And as
for wantin&rsquo; to know the truth, God bless ye, honey! th&rsquo; good
Fathers know it all now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t, Se&ntilde;&ndash;&ndash;Sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thin, they don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; mebby I&rsquo;m not so far from
agreein&rsquo; wid ye. But, och, it&rsquo;s dead beat I am, after the Sunday&rsquo;s
work! But ye air a right smart little helper, honey&ndash;&ndash;only,
ye don&rsquo;t belong in th&rsquo; kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;&ndash;&ndash;I mean, Sister&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, honey; ye&rsquo;ll get it in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, I&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to find Mr. Reed! Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, honey, it&rsquo;s few I know outside these walls. But ye
can put up a bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night. An&rsquo;
we&rsquo;d best be makin&rsquo; for th&rsquo; bed, too, darlin&rsquo;, for we&rsquo;ve a hard
day&rsquo;s work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Carmen&rsquo;s second night in New York, and as the girl
silently followed the puffing old woman up the several long,
dark flights of stairs to the little, cheerless room under the
eaves, it seemed to her that her brain must fly apart with the
pressure of its mental accumulation. The great building in
which she was now sheltered, the kitchen, with its marvels
of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights, annunciators, and a
thousand other equally wonderful appliances which the human
mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her fascinated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page25' name='book3_page25'></a>25</span>
despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask. Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had
not wholly suppressed, her curiosity, na&iuml;ve, eager, and insatiable,
rose mountain high. Sister Katherine had been kind to
her, had received her with open arms, and given her light tasks
to perform. And many times during the long afternoon the
old woman had relaxed entirely from her assumed brusqueness
and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon the
brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek. Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring
city, the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart
and wrapped her in a love that, roughly expressed, was yet
none the less tender and sincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds,&rdquo;
said the woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window
and looked out over the kindling lights of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would that do, Sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I guess, honey,&rdquo; answered the woman frankly.
&ldquo;Troth, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve asked her fer iverything in my time, from
diamonds to a husband, an&rsquo; she landed me in a convint! But
I ain&rsquo;t complainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t ask in the right way, Sister&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how! An&rsquo; whin I had
th&rsquo; carbuncle on me neck I yelled at her! Sure she may have
answered me prayer, fer th&rsquo; whoop I gave busted the carbuncle,
an&rsquo; I got well. Ye nivir kin tell, honey. An&rsquo; so I ain&rsquo;t complainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sis&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t call you Sister!&rdquo; pleaded the girl, going
to the woman and twining her arms about her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, honey darlin&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;tears started from the old woman&rsquo;s
eyes and rolled down her wrinkled cheeks&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;honey darlin&rsquo;,
call me Katie, just old Katie. Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have
had a home, an&rsquo; a beautiful daughter like you&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; She clasped
the girl in her great arms and held her tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God
has already given you what you need, and that there is nothing
that can keep you from seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman wiped her eyes on her sleeve. &ldquo;An&rsquo; so, darlin&rsquo;,
if I want diamonds I must know that I have &rsquo;em, is it that,
honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear thing!&rdquo; murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and
laying her soft cheek against the leathery visage of the old
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that again, honey&ndash;&ndash;och, say it again! It&rsquo;s words,
darlin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s nivir been said to old Katie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hasn&rsquo;t any one ever been kind to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page26' name='book3_page26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Kind! Och, ivirybody&rsquo;s kind to me, honey! But nobody
has ivir loved me&ndash;&ndash;that way. The good Lord made me a
fright, honey&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t ye noticed? I&rsquo;ve a face like an owl. An&rsquo;
they told me from th&rsquo; cradle up I&rsquo;d nivir land a man. An&rsquo; I
didn&rsquo;t, honey; they all ran from me&ndash;&ndash;an&rsquo; so I become a bride
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Church. But I ain&rsquo;t complainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Katie, the face is nothing. Why, your heart is as
big&ndash;&ndash;as big as the whole world! I hadn&rsquo;t been with you an
hour before I knew that. And, Katie dear, I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; murmured the woman, &ldquo;sure th&rsquo; Virgin be
praised fer sendin&rsquo; ye to me, a lonely old woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me
here,&rdquo; said the girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister&rsquo;s
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one, honey; the Virgin&rsquo;s th&rsquo; Mother o&rsquo; God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Katie! You don&rsquo;t know what you are saying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth, child, she has th&rsquo; same power as God! Don&rsquo;t we
pray to her, an&rsquo; she prays to th&rsquo; good God to save us? Don&rsquo;t
she have influence with Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Katie, no. There is no person or thing that persuades
God to be good to His children. There is nothing that influences
Him. He is infinite&ndash;&ndash;infinite mind, Katie, and infinite
good. Oh, Katie, what awful things are taught in this world
as truth! How little we know of the great God! And yet how
much people pretend they know about Him! But if they only
knew&ndash;&ndash;really <i>knew</i>, as Jesus did&ndash;&ndash;why, Katie, there wouldn&rsquo;t
be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole world!
Katie,&rdquo; after a little pause, &ldquo;I know. And I&rsquo;m going to tell
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Sister drew the child closer. &ldquo;Air these more o&rsquo;
yer funny notions, darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie,&rdquo;
answered the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t wonder! We are not taught such things,
honey. But then, th&rsquo; world moves, girlie&ndash;&ndash;even old Katie sees
that. Only, the Church don&rsquo;t move with it. An&rsquo; old Katie can
see that, too. An&rsquo; so, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, does Father Waite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he does, Katie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, an&rsquo; how do ye know it, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He talked with me&ndash;&ndash;a long time, this morning. He said
God had taught me what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, is it so? Thin me own suspicions air right; he&rsquo;s out
o&rsquo; tune! Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn&rsquo;t scold ye fer
yer funny notions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Katie, he said they were right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he so! Thin, lassie dear, things is goin&rsquo; to happen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page27' name='book3_page27'></a>27</span>
An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a good man&ndash;&ndash;troth, they make no better in this
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Sister lapsed into thought. Carmen looked out
wonderingly over the city. She yearned to know what it held
for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie,&rdquo; she said at length, bending again over the woman,
&ldquo;will you help me find Mr. Reed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, lassie&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s your name again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;Carmen Ariza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cair-men Aree&ndash;&ndash;now ain&rsquo;t that a name fer ye! An&rsquo; yer
nationality, girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Colombian, Katie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whist! Where is it? In Afrikay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;South America,&rdquo; with a little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now think o&rsquo; that! An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m Scotch-Irish, honey; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
both a long way from th&rsquo; ol&rsquo; sod! Lassie dear, tell me about
last night. But, no; begin &rsquo;way back. Give us th&rsquo; whole tale.
Old Katie&rsquo;s weak in th&rsquo; head, girlie, but she may see a way out
fer ye. Th&rsquo; Virgin help ye, puir bairn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower
when Carmen finished her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the Saints above!&rdquo; exclaimed the old Sister, staring at
the girl in amazement. &ldquo;Now do ye let me feel of ye to see
that ye air human; fer only a Saint could go through all that
an&rsquo; live to tell it! An&rsquo; the place ye were in last night! Now
be Saint Patrick, if I was rich I&rsquo;d have Masses said every day
fer that Jude who brung ye here! Don&rsquo;t tell me th&rsquo; good Lord
won&rsquo;t forgive her! Och, God! she&rsquo;s a Saint already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry
for her, but I don&rsquo;t know why. She has a beautiful home in
that hotel&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hotel, is it! Hivins above! But&ndash;&ndash;och, sure, it was a
hotel, honey. Only, ye air better off here wi&rsquo; old Katie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you will help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help you, lassie! God bless ye, yes! But&ndash;&ndash;unless it&rsquo;s wi&rsquo;
Father Waite, I don&rsquo;t know what I can do. Ye air in bad with
th&rsquo; Sister Superior fer yer talk at th&rsquo; breakfast table. Ye&rsquo;re a
fresh little heathen, honey. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;s suspicious of Father
Waite, too. We all air. An&rsquo; he th&rsquo; best man on airth! But
his doctrine ain&rsquo;t just sound, sweatheart. Hivins, doctrine! It
means more&rsquo;n a good heart! There, honey, lave it to me. But
it&rsquo;s got to be done quick, or th&rsquo; Sister Superior&rsquo;ll have ye in
an orphan asylum, where ye&rsquo;ll stay till ye air soused in th&rsquo;
doctrine! I can manage to get word to Father Waite to-morrow,
airly. Jinny will run over fer me. A bit of a word
wi&rsquo; him&rsquo;ll fix it, lassie dear. An&rsquo; now, honey swate, off with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page28' name='book3_page28'></a>28</span>
them funny clothes and plump into bed. Saints above! it&rsquo;s
all but marnin&rsquo; now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay
so quiet at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;was ye tellin&rsquo; me awhile back that
ye knew the right way to pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Katie dear,&rdquo; the child murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin do you pray, lass, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll not trouble the Virgin this
night.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Well, Father, what do you think now?&rdquo; The Sister Superior
looked up aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the
room. His head was bowed, and there was a look of deep
earnestness upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have talked with her again&ndash;&ndash;an hour, or more,&rdquo; he said
reflectively. &ldquo;She is a&ndash;&ndash;a remarkable girl, in many ways.&rdquo; He
stopped, uncertain how to proceed.</p>
<p>The Sister eyed him keenly. &ldquo;She attracts and repels me,
both,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At times she seems positively uncanny. And
she appears to be suffering from religious dementia. Do you
not think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his
words carefully before replying. &ldquo;She does&ndash;&ndash;seem to&ndash;&ndash;to have
rather&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;rather unusual&ndash;&ndash;religious views,&rdquo; said he slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be well to have Dr. Sullivan examine her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we may know what to do with her. If she is mentally
unsound she must not be sent to the orphanage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should be taken&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;I mean, we should try to locate
her friends. I have already searched the city directory; but,
though there are many Reeds, there are none listed with the
initials she gave me as his. I had thought,&rdquo; he continued
hesitatingly, &ldquo;I had thought of putting her in charge of the
Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Waite!&rdquo; The Sister Superior rose and drew herself
up to her full height. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that you have contemplated
delivering her into the hands of heretics?&rdquo; she demanded
coldly, her tall figure instinct with the mortal pride of
religious superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sister,&rdquo; returned the priest with embarrassment,
&ldquo;would it not be wise to place her among those whose views
harmonize more closely with hers than ours do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! I am surprised&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;she is not a Catholic!&rdquo; urged the man, with a gesture
of impatience. &ldquo;And she will never be one. The combined
weight of all the centuries of church authority could not make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page29' name='book3_page29'></a>29</span>
her one&ndash;&ndash;never! I must take her to those with whom she
rightfully belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sister Superior&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and glittered, and her
face grew dark. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said in a low tone. &ldquo;I would
rather see her dead! Father Waite, you exceed your authority!
I am in charge here, and I shall report this case to the
Bishop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest stood hesitant for a moment. The futility of his
case seemed to impress him. Taking up his hat, he bowed
without speaking and went out. The Sister Superior stepped
to the telephone. Outside the door the man listened until he
caught the number she called. His face grew dark and angry,
and his hands clenched a she strode down the hall.</p>
<p>On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister
Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist! Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and turned to the woman. Her finger went up
to her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait on th&rsquo; corner&ndash;&ndash;behind the church! The lassie will
meet you there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into
the dark stairway. Stopping at a small closet below, she took
out a bundle. Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned
Carmen, who was sitting at a table peeling potatoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troth, lazy lass,&rdquo; she commanded sharply, &ldquo;do you take
the bucket and mop and begin on the front steps. And mind
that ye don&rsquo;t bring me heavy hand down on ye! Och, lassie
darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she added, when she had drawn the startled girl out
of hearing of the others, &ldquo;give yer old Katie a kiss, and then be
off! Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye go&ndash;&ndash;but &rsquo;twould break
yours to stay! Go, lassie darlin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t fergit old Katie!
Here,&rdquo; thrusting the girl&rsquo;s bundle and a dollar bill into her
hands, &ldquo;an&rsquo; God bless ye, lass! Ye&rsquo;ve won me, heart an&rsquo; soul!
Ye&rsquo;ll find a frind at th&rsquo; nixt corner!&rdquo; pointing up the street. She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.</p>
<p>For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it
all. She looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building
from which she had been ejected. There was no visible sign
of life. Then, grasping her bundle and the dollar bill, she
hurried out through the gate and started up the street.</p>
<p>Around the corner stood Father Waite. The man&rsquo;s face
was furrowed, and his body trembled. The girl went up to
him with a glad smile. The priest looked up, and muttered
something incoherent under his breath a she took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, Padre?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page30' name='book3_page30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an
approaching street car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To police headquarters,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to ask them to help
us find your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
</div>
<p>From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the
ocean, the fog was again creeping stealthily across the
bay and into the throbbing arteries of the great city.
Through half-opened doors and windows it rolled like smoke,
and piled like drifted snow against the mountains of brick and
stone. Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it swirled
around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to
the windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted
through the chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall
over the dingy rooms within.</p>
<p>To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it
seemed a fitting external expression of the heavy gloom within
his soul. Crumpled into the chair at the broad table in his
private office, with his long, thin legs stretched out before him,
his hands crammed into the pockets of his trousers, and his
bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest, until it seemed as if
the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like visage must be
penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment of
utter dejection. On the littered table, where he had just
tossed it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral
properties of the Molino Company&ndash;&ndash;the &ldquo;near-mines&rdquo;
in the rocky ca&ntilde;on of the far-off Boque. Near it lay the current
number of a Presbyterian review, wherein the merits of
this now moribund project were advertised in terms whose
glitter had attracted swarms of eager, trusting investors.</p>
<p>The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something
of a misnomer. The company itself was an experiment,
whose end had not justified its inception. It had been launched
a few years previously by Douglass Ketchim to provide business
careers for his two sons, James and Philip. The old gentleman,
still hale and vigorous, was one of those sturdy Englishmen
who had caught the infection of &rsquo;49 and abruptly severed the
ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the allurements
of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.
Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panam&aacute; and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer
drove him, until he reached the golden sands of
California. There he toiled for many years, until Fortune at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page31' name='book3_page31'></a>31</span>
length smiled upon his quenchless efforts. Then he tossed aside
his rough tools and set out for the less constricted fields of the
East.</p>
<p>He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years
turned it several times. He became a banker. He aspired to
the hand of a sister of a railway president, and won it. He
educated his sons in the best colleges of the East, and then
sent them to Europe on their honeymoons. And finally, when
the burden of years began to press noticeably, and the game
became less attractive, he retired from the field of business,
cleared off his indebtedness, organized the Ketchim Realty
Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis, and then
committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.</p>
<p>The result was chaos. At the expiration of a year the old
gentleman hurried back into the harness to save the remnant
of his fortune, only to find it inextricably tied up in lands of
dubious value and questionable promotional schemes. The
untangling of the real estate he immediately took into his own
hands. The schemes he left to his sons.</p>
<p>A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a
form of parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in
these days has battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk
of legitimate commercial enterprise. They were as dissimilar,
and each as unlike his father, as is possible among members of
the same family. Both sought, with diligent consecration, the
same goal, money; but employed wholly different means to gain
that end. James, the elder, was a man of ready wit, a nimble
tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could think
of any one but himself, was affable and gracious. He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the
avowed champion of every sort of artifice and device employed
in ancient, mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own
selfish desires, in the minimum of time, and at whatever cost
to his fellow-man. In his cups he was a witty, though arrogant,
braggart. In his home he was petulant and childish. Of real
business acumen and constructive wisdom, he had none. He
would hew his way to wealth, if need be, openly defiant of
God, man, or the devil. Or he would work in subtler ways,
through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe. But he generally
wore his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business
relations with him soon discovered that, though utterly
unscrupulous, his character was continuously revealed through
his small conceit, which caused him so to work as to be seen of
men and gain their cheap plaudits for his sharp, mendacious
practices.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page32' name='book3_page32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>Philip retained a degree of his father&rsquo;s confidence&ndash;&ndash;which
James wholly lacked&ndash;&ndash;and he spared himself no pains to cultivate
it. Though far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic
brother, he was a tenacious plodder, and was for this
reason much more likely ultimately to achieve his sordid purposes.
His energy was tireless, and he never admitted defeat.
He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a decided
line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue. Apparently, he was a man of
exemplary habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the
taste of tobacco or liquor could not be refuted. He was an
elder in the Presbyterian church in the little suburb where he
lived, and superintendent of its Sunday school. His prayers
were beautiful expressions of reverent piety; and his conversation,
at all times chaste and modest, announced him a man
of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive. While
it is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable
act, or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and
brotherly love performed by him, yet no one could ever point
to a single coarse or mean action emanating from the man. If
there was discord in company affairs, the wanton James always
bore the onus. And because of this, relations between the
brothers gradually assumed a condition of strain, until at
length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a hypocrite,
and refused longer to work with him. Thereupon the
milder Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator,
in the person of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but
loyal Hermes, who thenceforth performed the multifold functions
of pacificator, go-between, human telephone, and bearer
of messages, documents, and what-not from one to the other
for a nominal wage and the crumbs that dropped from the
promoter&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply
immersed in both. He was still shaking from the fright which
he had received that morning. On opening the door as he was
about to leave his house to take the train to the city, he had
confronted two bulky policemen. With a muffled shriek he had
slammed the door in their astonished faces and darted back into
the house, his heart in his throat and hammering madly. How
could he know that they were only selling tickets to a Policemen&rsquo;s
Ball? Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the
street, laughing and turning often to glance back at the house
that held such a queer-mannered inmate.</p>
<p>Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had
lapsed, Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page33' name='book3_page33'></a>33</span>
report of Reed and Harris. Sullenly he turned its pages, while
the sallow skin on his low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like
face drew into ugly contortions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they see that clause in their
contract, providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for
them in case they made a favorable report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the
noiseless entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us&ndash;&ndash;names
and addresses of his congregation. I&rsquo;ve mailed them all
descriptive matter; and I wrote Mr. Jurges that the price of his
stock would be five dollars, but that we couldn&rsquo;t sell to his
congregation for less than seven. That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it? I told
him Molino stock would go up to par next month. That&rsquo;s what
you said, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much stock did Jurges say he&rsquo;d take?&rdquo; demanded
Ketchim, without looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he said he could only get together two thousand
dollars at present, but that later he would have some endowment
insurance falling due&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a year, I think he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that. Did you
write him so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;but I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so&ndash;&ndash;but only hint at it. And tell him to send his
check at once for the stock he has agreed to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he sent that some days ago. I thought you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused.
&ldquo;Well, where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&ndash;&ndash;your brother James received the letter, and I believe
he put the check in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage. &ldquo;You tell James,&rdquo; he
cried, pounding the desk with his fist, &ldquo;that as president and
treasurer of the Molino Company I demand that check!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cass &rsquo;phoned before you got down this morning. He
said the bank refused to extend the time on your note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became
ashen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is the mail,&rdquo; pursued the gentle Hermes, handing
him a bundle of letters.</p>
<p>Ketchim roused himself with an effort. His eyes flashed
angrily. &ldquo;Do you know whether James has been selling any
of his own Molino stock?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page34' name='book3_page34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I believe he has, sir&ndash;&ndash;a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! And how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sold some two hundred shares yesterday&ndash;&ndash;I believe; to
a Miss Leveridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leveridge? Who&rsquo;s she? What did he get for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Leveridge children&ndash;&ndash;grown men and women now&ndash;&ndash;have
just sold their farm down state; and Mr. James saw
the sale announced in the papers. So he got in touch with
Miss Alvina Leveridge. I believe he sent Houghton down there;
and he closed a deal. Mr. James got eight dollars a share, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe! You <i>know</i>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; meekly.</p>
<p>Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did the Leveridges get for their farm? And
why didn&rsquo;t you inform me of the sale?&rdquo; he demanded, fixing
the humble Rawlins with a cold eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe. And I
didn&rsquo;t see the notice until&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As usual, James saw it first! An excellent scout you are!
Twenty-five thousand dollars! How many acres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred and eighty, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim reflected. &ldquo;James is still dickering with Miss
Leveridge, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nezlett got back last night, didn&rsquo;t he? Very well, call him
up and tell him to get ready to go at once to&ndash;&ndash;wherever the
Leveridges live. And&ndash;&ndash;I want to see him right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.
As his glance fell upon the pile he gasped. Then he quickly
drew out a letter and tore it open. His thin lips moved rapidly
as his eyes roved over the paper. He laid the letter down and
looked wildly about. Then he took it up again and read aloud
the closing words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and believing
that your representations were made with intent to deceive, I shall, unless
immediate reparation or satisfactory explanation is made, take such steps
as my counsel may advise.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Yours, etc.,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;J. WILTON AMES.&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum
from a drawer and consulted it. &ldquo;He put in ten thousand,
cash,&rdquo; he murmured, closing the book and replacing it. &ldquo;And
I always wondered why, for he doesn&rsquo;t go into things that he
can&rsquo;t control. There&rsquo;s where I was a fool! He shouldn&rsquo;t have
been sold a dollar&rsquo;s worth! He knows we can&rsquo;t return the
money; and now he&rsquo;s tightening the screws! He has something
up his sleeve; and we&rsquo;ve fallen for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page35' name='book3_page35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud. &ldquo;Why did
he buy? Did he think he&rsquo;d reach Uncle Ted through us? By
Jove! that&rsquo;s it! For a year or more he&rsquo;s wanted to oust Uncle
from the C. &amp; R., and now he thinks by threatening the family
with disgrace, and us fellows with the pen, he can do it! What
fools we&rsquo;ve been! Oh, if I ever get out of this I&rsquo;ll steer clear of
these deals in the future!&rdquo; It was his stock resolution, which
had never borne fruit.</p>
<p>The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly
announced the arrival of Reed and Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show them in at once!&rdquo; cried Ketchim, jumping up and
hastily passing his hands over his hair and face. Then, advancing
with a wan smile, he courteously greeted the callers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, fellows,&rdquo; he began, waving them to seats, &ldquo;it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve just been reading your
report&ndash;&ndash;although of course you told me over the &rsquo;phone yesterday
that there was no hope. But,&rdquo; he continued gravely, and
his face grew serious, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, very glad, of one thing, and
that is that there are men in the world to-day who are above
temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo; queried Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, &ldquo;the little
joker that James inserted in the contract, about your getting
fifty thousand in the event of a favorable report. I told him it
didn&rsquo;t look well&ndash;&ndash;but he said it would test you. He would be
funny, though, no matter how serious the business. But you
showed that you were men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at
once. &ldquo;We have been studying how we could help you pull
the thing out of the fire. Suppose you give us,&rdquo; he suggested,
&ldquo;a little of Molino&rsquo;s history. Then perhaps something may
occur to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; replied Ketchim gloomily. &ldquo;The
mines were located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul
at Cartagena. He is half Colombian, I believe. He came
up to New York and interested Bryan, Westler, and some
others, and they asked us to act as fiscal agents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never had title to the property,&rdquo; said Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we have the title! Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made
the acquaintance of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian
army. When he learned that we were mining men he told us
he had a string of rich properties that he would like to sell. I
inquired their location, and he said they lay along the Boque
river. And I learned that he had clear title to the property,
too&ndash;&ndash;Molino&rsquo;s mines. Now you have sold some three or four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page36' name='book3_page36'></a>36</span>
hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; murmured Ketchim weakly, &ldquo;we thought we had.
We acted in good faith&ndash;&ndash;we took Mr. Lakes&rsquo;s word&ndash;&ndash;and we
showed our confidence and sincerity by purchasing machinery
to operate&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!&rdquo; ejaculated
Harris with a laugh. &ldquo;I judge it was designed to manufacture
barrel staves, rather than to extract gold! Lakes had it shipped
to Cartagena; rented part of an old woman&rsquo;s house; dumped
the machinery in there; and now she&rsquo;s wild. Can&rsquo;t get her pay
from you for storing the machinery; and can&rsquo;t sell the stuff,
nor move it. So there she sits, under some six or eight tons of
iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim smiled feebly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;But
Molino has no funds&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still selling stock, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; demanded Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; quickly returned Ketchim. &ldquo;We would not sell
any more stock until we received your report&ndash;&ndash;and not then,
unless the report were favorable. That would not have been
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed eyed him narrowly. But the image of truth sat enthroned
upon Ketchim&rsquo;s sharp features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unfortunate, boys,&rdquo; the promoter continued dejectedly.
&ldquo;But I care nothing for my own losses; it&rsquo;s the poor stockholders
I am thinking about. I would do anything to relieve
them. I&rsquo;ve prayed to be led to do right. What would you
suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest,&rdquo; blurted out Harris, &ldquo;that, having already relieved
them considerably, you&rsquo;ll soon be wearing a striped
suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last trace of color faded from Ketchim&rsquo;s face, but the
sickly smile remained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d wear it, willingly, if by so doing
I could help these poor people,&rdquo; he mournfully replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; pursued Harris, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll help some when they learn
that you&rsquo;re in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
&ldquo;to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to
dinner with me, and we will talk this all over. Then in the
afternoon I want you to come over and see my little Sunday
school. Fellows,&rdquo; he continued gravely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve prayed for you
and for your success every day since you left. And my faith
in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your adverse
report. He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page37' name='book3_page37'></a>37</span>
puzzled expressions on their faces. The man continued earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have
said. There must be other mineral properties available there.
Did you see none on your travels? Or could we not organize
an exploration party to search for mines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d furnish the wherewithal?&rdquo; asked Harris bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that could be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your sheep stand for further shearing?&rdquo; queried the
grinning Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair
closer, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got something&ndash;&ndash;I know it! You&rsquo;ve got something
to suggest that will save the Molino stockholders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not yourself, eh?&rdquo; taunted Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall sacrifice myself,&rdquo; answered Ketchim deprecatingly.
His manner had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly
toward them.</p>
<p>Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other.
&ldquo;I guess we might as well,&rdquo; said Reed in a low voice. &ldquo;It is
bound to come out, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; returned Harris; &ldquo;drive ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ketchim,&rdquo; began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting
man, &ldquo;when I came to New York a year ago, looking for a
business opening, my friend and former classmate in the University,
Mr. Cass, put me in touch with you. At that time you
were booming the Molino company hard, and, I have no doubt,
thought you really had something down in Colombia. But
when you offered to lease me a portion of your properties there,
I laughed at you. And, in the course of time, I succeeded in
convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock. Then,
after months of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down
to Colombia at my own expense to examine Molino&rsquo;s mines, to
ascertain whether or not I wished to operate a part of them on
a royalty basis, you adopted my own view, namely, that the
time had come for you to know whether the company possessed
anything of value or not. And so you sent my associate,
Mr. Harris, and myself down there to examine and report
on Molino&rsquo;s so-called mines. And you gave us each a
block of stock as part compensation. We found the mines
barren. And now you have got to face a body of stockholders
from whom you have lured thousands of dollars by your misrepresentations.
From talks with your salesmen, I am convinced
that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of my salesmen told you that?&rdquo; interrupted Ketchim
heatedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page38' name='book3_page38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us waive that,&rdquo; replied Reed calmly. &ldquo;The fact is, you
are in a hard way just at present, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility,
&ldquo;the officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been
grossly deceived and unfortunately&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; interrupted Reed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll pass that. But Harris
and I have played square with you. And we are going to continue
to do so, and to offer you a possible opportunity to do
something for your poor stockholders, and incidentally for yourself
and us. The fact is, we do know of another property
down there, but we haven&rsquo;t the title&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference!&rdquo; interrupted Ketchim. &ldquo;I mean,
it can be acquired&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; striving to restrain his eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the question,&rdquo; replied Reed. &ldquo;The title is at
present vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately,
is lost. This girl came up to the States with us&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself.
&ldquo;Then you broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever
you might acquire there should belong to me! I engaged
your services, remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; put in Harris dryly, &ldquo;we were employed by the
Molino company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my mother advanced the funds to send you down
there!&rdquo; cried Ketchim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the poor stockholders?&rdquo; queried Harris, with
an insinuating grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking for the stockholders, of course,&rdquo; said Ketchim,
subsiding. &ldquo;But, proceed, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard
of again,&rdquo; continued Reed. &ldquo;Nor is it likely that the title
papers, which she has with her, will be of any use to those into
whose hands she has fallen. Her old foster-father held the title
to this mine, but transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she
and I should divide a large interest in the stock of a company
formed to develop and operate it. For my share, I agreed to
bring the young girl to the States and place her in a school, at
my own expense.&rdquo; He went on to relate the manner in which
Carmen had been lost, and then continued: &ldquo;Of course, the
title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl&rsquo;s
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.
But, now that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will relocate it!&rdquo; declared Ketchim impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t be right to the old man,&rdquo; returned Reed.
&ldquo;But, it might be that the property could now be secured from
him. He is old and penniless, and without any further interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page39' name='book3_page39'></a>39</span>
in life. It is a bare chance, but we might prevail upon him to
join us in the formation of a company to take over his mine,
La Libertad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the name of it?&rdquo; asked Ketchim, reaching for a
writing pad. &ldquo;Spell it for me, please. And the name of the old
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed complied, and then continued: &ldquo;Now, Mr. Ketchim,
we are living strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving
you this information. It would require not less than one
hundred thousand dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine,
develop it, make trails, and erect a stamp-mill. Mr. Harris and
I are in no condition financially to advance or secure such an
amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is barely possible,&rdquo; mused Harris, &ldquo;that my father and
Uncle John could do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to call upon them!&rdquo; cried Ketchim. &ldquo;Your
interest, Mr. Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as
you were acting under contract with us&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have covered that point, Mr. Ketchim,&rdquo; replied Reed
evenly. &ldquo;But the time has come for us all to put our shoulders
to the wheel, act fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders,
and at the same time make good ourselves. Mr. Harris
and I have barely entered upon our business careers, and we
have come to New York to establish ourselves. This may afford
the opportunity. We know where this mine is&ndash;&ndash;we know the
old man, and may be able to influence him. To forestall possible
complications, we should begin negotiations with him at
once. But&ndash;&ndash;remember&ndash;&ndash;everything must be done in the name
of the company, not in your own name. And Mr. Harris and
I must personally negotiate with the old man, and receive a very
liberal compensation for our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; cried the excited Ketchim. &ldquo;Goodness, fellows!
why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this yesterday over the &rsquo;phone, and save
me a night of torment? But I forgive you. Gracious! Rawlins,&rdquo;
he said, addressing that individual, who had entered in
response to the buzzer, &ldquo;&rsquo;phone Cass to come right over. And
tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten dollars for our lunch, and
charge it to Molino. It&rsquo;s company business. By Jove, fellows!
this is a happy day for me. Since the old man gave you a
share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it to get,&rdquo; amended Harris dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get it!&rdquo; cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully.
&ldquo;But now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about
your trip. It is wonderful! And so romantic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced;
and Ketchim, after detailing to him the previous conversation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page40' name='book3_page40'></a>40</span>
launched into the project which had been developing in his own
mind while Reed had been describing his experiences in the
South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we want is another organization, fellows,&rdquo; he said
in conclusion, &ldquo;to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its
assets with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to
get in on the ground floor, and so on. We&rsquo;ll let Molino die in
the arms of a new company, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one with a somewhat wider scope,&rdquo; suggested Cass,
with an air of importance. &ldquo;A sort of general development
company, to secure La Libertad, if possible; prospect for other
mineral properties; and develop the resources of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm.
&ldquo;A company to go in for coffee, cotton&ndash;&ndash;you say you saw wild
cotton, didn&rsquo;t you, fellows? Great! And cocoanuts, timber,
cattle&ndash;&ndash;in fact, we&rsquo;ll get concessions from the Colombian Government,
and we&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just rip things wide open, eh?&rdquo; finished Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Ketchim radiantly. &ldquo;Uncle Ted has influence
at Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so
on&ndash;&ndash;why, we can get anything we want! Ames and the bank
will both cool down&ndash;&ndash;by Jove, this is great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil
the wheels?&rdquo; put in the practical Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can sell the stock,&rdquo; replied Ketchim. &ldquo;Then, too,
there&rsquo;s the Molino stockholders; why, I&rsquo;ll bet there&rsquo;s hardly one
that wouldn&rsquo;t be able to scrape up a few dollars more for the
new company! By the way, what&rsquo;ll we call it? Give us a name,
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it the Salvation Company,&rdquo; drawled Harris, &ldquo;as it
is likely to delay your trip to Sing Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed
the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest we call it the Simit&iacute; Development Company,&rdquo;
said Cass, after a moment&rsquo;s dignified reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; cried Ketchim. &ldquo;It has a prosperous ring! And
now its capitalization? We must make it big!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; returned Cass. &ldquo;If these gentlemen can acquire
that mine, I think I would capitalize for, say, about three
millions.&rdquo; He went to the desk and made some calculations.
&ldquo;I assume,&rdquo; he continued somewhat pompously after a few
moments&rsquo; figuring, &ldquo;that you wish to retain me, and that I am
to take my compensation in stock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim quickly assented. He knew that Cass had correctly
concluded that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.
And, at best, it was only a hazard, a wild gamble. In fact, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page41' name='book3_page41'></a>41</span>
was a last desperate chance. Moreover, stock was always
available; while cash was a rare commodity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, then,&rdquo; continued the sapient young lawyer, &ldquo;that
we capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred
and one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise
money for development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty
Company one million, as compensation for acting as fiscal
agents of the new company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as
part compensation for past and future services, the sum of four
hundred thousand in stock; give to the stockholders of the
Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine thousand in stock for
all the assets, machinery, good will, <i>et cetera</i>, of that company;
and to me, for services to be rendered, forty thousand dollars&rsquo;
worth of the stock. All of us shall agree not to sell any of our
personal holdings of stock until the company shall be placed
upon a dividend-paying basis. And Mr. Reed, or Mr. Harris, or
both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine,
and prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty
Company at once endeavor to sell the treasury stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass
settled back in his chair and awaited remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Ketchim at length, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right&ndash;&ndash;only,
I think we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we
wish. Of course,&rdquo; with a deprecating wave of his hand, &ldquo;there
isn&rsquo;t the slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that&ndash;&ndash;with
a mine such as you have described, fellows. But&ndash;&ndash;why
hedge us about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one dollar&rsquo;s worth of your stock shall you be permitted
to sell!&rdquo; cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide
later,&rdquo; offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord. He was young,
scarcely out of the twenties, just married, just admitted to the
bar, and eager to get a toe-hold in the world of business. &ldquo;And
now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if agreeable to you, I will put this
through at once, organize the company, and get the charter.
You gentlemen will return to Colombia as soon as Mr. Ketchim
can provide the necessary funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership,&rdquo;
said Reed. &ldquo;As such, we will handle the affairs of the new
company in Colombia. Mr. Harris will proceed to that country,
while I go to California to open a copper mine which we have
taken over there. In time I will relieve Mr. Harris in the South.
Now, Mr. Ketchim, what can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.
Rawlins has just told me of one prospect, a bully one! We
don&rsquo;t need to wait for the papers from Albany before going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page42' name='book3_page42'></a>42</span>
ahead. But we find it costs about forty-eight cents to sell a
dollar&rsquo;s worth of stock, and so some time will be needed to
raise enough to send Mr. Harris back to Colombia&ndash;&ndash;unless,&rdquo; he
added, eying Harris furtively, &ldquo;he will advance us the amount
of his own expenses&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which he will not!&rdquo; retorted Harris warmly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
it, anyway. Nor has Reed. We&rsquo;re both broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a revolution on down there now,&rdquo; said Reed, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;d better go easy for a while. Besides, Harris needs time to
study the language. But, are we all agreed on the terms?
Salary for Harris while in Colombia to be settled later, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all satisfactory, I think,&rdquo; said Ketchim, smiling happily.
&ldquo;The details can be worked out anon&ndash;&ndash;Molino stockholders&rsquo;
meeting, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Reed, rising, &ldquo;we will consider the new company
launched, to take over the defunct Molino and to operate
on a comprehensive scale in Colombia, beginning with the
development of La Libertad, if we can secure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.
&ldquo;A gentleman to see Mr. Reed,&rdquo; he announced softly; &ldquo;a priest,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris sprang to his feet. The door swung open, and Father
Waite entered with Carmen.</p>
<p>With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded
into the arms of the astonished Harris. Reed grasped the
priest&rsquo;s hand, and begged him to speak. Ketchim and the young
lawyer looked on in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.
Reed,&rdquo; explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness.
&ldquo;But at police headquarters I found that you had made inquiries,
and that detectives were searching for the girl. I
learned that you were living with your wife&rsquo;s sister, and that
you had no business address, having just come up from South
America. So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your wife
informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office. I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as
you see, is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting
experience or two to add to the large fund she already possessed.&rdquo;
He looked down at Carmen and smiled. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo;
he concluded, laughing, as he prepared to depart, &ldquo;I will not
ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I have several witnesses
to the fact that I have delivered her to the proper custodian.&rdquo;
He bowed and went to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Reed, seizing him by the hand. &ldquo;We want to
thank you! We want to know you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page43' name='book3_page43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you my card,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;And I would
be very happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted
to see and talk with the little girl.&rdquo; He handed his card to
Reed; then nodded and smiled at Carmen and went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and
making after him. But he was too late. The priest had already
caught a descending elevator, and disappeared. Harris
returned to the bewildered group. &ldquo;I guess that knocks the
Simit&iacute; Company sky-high,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;for here is the sole
owner of La Libertad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he
would keep his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following
day, picked up Carmen&rsquo;s precious bundle and, taking
her hand, left the room. &ldquo;I am going home,&rdquo; he called back to
Harris; &ldquo;and you be sure to come up to the house to-night.
We&rsquo;ll have to readjust our plans now.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_5_1_1' id='CHAPTER_5_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Reed,&rdquo; said Harris the following day, as they sat in the
dusty, creaking car that was conveying them to their
dinner appointment with Ketchim, &ldquo;who is this Ames
that Ketchim referred to yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.
Reed was reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received
from Ketchim over the telephone the previous evening.
But the girl, subdued by the rush of events since her precipitation
into the seething American world of materialism, sat apart
from them, gazing with rapt attention through the begrimed
window at the flying scenery, and trying to interpret it in the
light of her own tenacious views of life and the universe. If
the marvels of this new world into which she had been thrown
had failed to realize her expectations&ndash;&ndash;if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real,
less substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power
to charm&ndash;&ndash;she gave no hint. She was still absorbing, sifting
and digesting the welter of impressions. She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her
thoughts a tangled jumble, which she strove incessantly to
unravel and classify according to their content of reality, as
judged by her own standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ames,&rdquo; replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon
Carmen, &ldquo;is a multimillionaire financier of New York&ndash;&ndash;surely
you have heard of him! He and his clique practically own the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page44' name='book3_page44'></a>44</span>
United States, and a large slice of Europe. For some reason
Ames bought a block of Molino stock. And now, I judge, Ketchim
would give his chances on eternal life if he hadn&rsquo;t sold it
to him. And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s worrying me, too. For, since Ames
is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t going to be any new company,&rdquo; asserted Harris
doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be!&rdquo; cried Reed. &ldquo;Ketchim holds us strictly
to our contract. Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made
while in the employ of Molino. It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if we
had only Ketchim to deal with. We&rsquo;ve got the goods on him
and could beat him. But here enters Ames, a man of unlimited
wealth and influence. If he wants La Libertad, he&rsquo;s going to
get it, you mark me! Where we fell down was in ever mentioning
it to Ketchim. For if we don&rsquo;t come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames. He told me over the &rsquo;phone
last night that he was badly in debt&ndash;&ndash;that Ames was pressing
him&ndash;&ndash;that many of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent
inquiries. Oh, he quite opened his heart! And yesterday
I saw on his desk a letter from Ames. I can imagine what
it contained. Ketchim would sacrifice us and everything else to
keep himself out of Ames&rsquo;s grip. We&rsquo;re in for it, I tell you!
And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Harris, &ldquo;but doesn&rsquo;t it sound like a
fairy-tale, the way Carmen got back to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am,&rdquo; continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation,
&ldquo;left with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy
prospect of losing out all around. My wife said emphatically
last night that she wouldn&rsquo;t be bothered with Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she won&rsquo;t bother you. Send her away to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Good idea!&rdquo; replied Reed sarcastically. &ldquo;But do you
realize that that involves expense? I&rsquo;m a comparatively poor
man, just getting a start in my profession, and with a young
and socially ambitious wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;your wife&ndash;&ndash;er, she&rsquo;s going to&ndash;&ndash;to have money some
day, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true. But the grim reaper has a little work to do
first. And on occasions like this he&rsquo;s always deucedly deliberate,
you know. Meantime, we&rsquo;re skating close to the edge&ndash;&ndash;for
New Yorkers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim. Now, my father
and Uncle John&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!&rdquo; snapped Reed
impatiently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page45' name='book3_page45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said Reed, starting up and making for
the door. &ldquo;And now you rake your thought for some way to
deal with Ketchim. And leave your father and Uncle John
entirely out of the conversation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers
mounted the steps. &ldquo;See that fellow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after
giving them a hearty welcome. &ldquo;I just sold him a hundred
shares of Simit&iacute; stock, at five dollars a share&ndash;&ndash;just half of par.
Beginning right on the jump, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; protested Harris, as they entered the spacious
parlor, &ldquo;the company isn&rsquo;t even in existence yet&ndash;&ndash;and hasn&rsquo;t
an asset!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Ketchim easily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming
into existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!
Boys,&rdquo; he went on earnestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking over the
&rsquo;phone with Mr. Ames, our most influential stockholder, and a
very warm friend of mine. I told him about our conversation
of yesterday. He says, go right ahead with the new company&ndash;&ndash;that
it&rsquo;s a great idea. He&rsquo;s satisfied with his present holding,
and will not increase it. Says he wants Molino stockholders to
have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury stock, if they
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly magnanimous,&rdquo; returned Reed. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;what
about the basis of organization of the new company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it as we planned it, he says. He thinks the arrangement
and division of stock fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly. It did
not seem possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on Ketchim, &ldquo;have you seen the morning
papers? They are full of the revolution in Colombia. The
country is torn wide open, and reports say nothing can be done
down there until peace is restored&ndash;&ndash;and that may take a year or
two. But, meantime, we will go ahead and organize the new
company and take over Molino and prepare to begin work just
as soon as you fellows can get into that country. Everybody
has simply got to wait until then. And so this,&rdquo; going to Carmen
and taking her hand, &ldquo;is the wonderful little girl! Well!
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrance of Mrs. Ketchim and her troop of children at
this juncture interrupted the conversation. &ldquo;All enthusiastic
Simit&iacute; stockholders,&rdquo; said Ketchim, waving his hand toward
them, after the introductions. &ldquo;And all going to get rich out of
it, too&ndash;&ndash;as well as yourselves, boys. It simply shows how Providence
works&ndash;&ndash;one with God is a majority, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page46' name='book3_page46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>Dinner over, the men were left alone. Carmen had been
taken upstairs by the children to the nursery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got myself slated for the presidency of the new company,&rdquo;
said Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest
his heart; &ldquo;and I think we&rsquo;d better put brother James in as
vice-president. Perfectly safe,&rdquo; looking at Harris and winking.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to be recognized, you know, since the Ketchim Realty
Company act as fiscal agents. Now for directors I&rsquo;ve put down
Judge Harris, your father&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s to assure you boys that there&rsquo;ll
be some one to look after your interests. Then we&rsquo;ll say Reverend
Jurges for another. He&rsquo;s got a big congregation and will
be able to place a lot of stock. You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people! You&rsquo;d never
believe he was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an
eye single to heavenly riches! Then one of you fellows, say
Reed, had better go on the directorate, since Harris will be in
Colombia in charge of operations. And&ndash;&ndash;well, Cass, too. He&rsquo;s
young and immature, but absolutely square. He&rsquo;ll do all the
legal work for his stock interest. We save money that way,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do I do while we are waiting?&rdquo; asked Harris
in some perplexity. &ldquo;Reed goes to California right away, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, old man,&rdquo; Ketchim genially assured him.
&ldquo;The new company will be organized at once&ndash;&ndash;this week, if
possible. You go on salary from the moment of its incorporation,
and you open your office right here in this building. I&rsquo;ll
see that the rent is paid until you go back to Colombia. Everything&rsquo;s
arranged, and you turn right in and help Cass with the
new company. There&rsquo;ll be plenty to do. You&rsquo;ve got to prepare
circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and prospects;
follow up leads; and&ndash;&ndash;oh, you&rsquo;ll be busy! But here
comes Reverend Coles,&rdquo; looking out of the window as a man
came up the steps. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s interested in some projects I&rsquo;ve been
exploiting. Just excuse me for a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into
a back room. Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation
of their own mixed thoughts. Presently Harris, whose eyes
had been dilating for some moments, broke out in a hoarse
whisper: &ldquo;Listen! God a&rsquo;mighty!&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s praying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up softly and approached the door of the room into
which Ketchim had taken his caller. In a few minutes he returned
to his chair. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I could see
Ketchim through the keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying
with that fellow! Now what the d&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed held up a warning finger. Through the silence that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page47' name='book3_page47'></a>47</span>
fell upon them snatches of the prayer being offered in the
adjoining room floated to their ears&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;O, blessed Saviour,
vouchsafe prosperity to our venture, we beseech thee! The
earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and the fullness thereof&ndash;&ndash;we ask thy blessing
on these efforts of ours to wrest from the ground the wealth
which the Father of lights has deposited there for the benefit
of His children&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris snickered aloud. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Reed shook his head in warning. &ldquo;It may not be a game,&rdquo;
he replied. &ldquo;But if it is, it&rsquo;s an old one, hiding behind the
mask of religion. But I&rsquo;m inclined to believe the man sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; retorted Harris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather deal with his
brother. I know James to be an out-and-out rascal&ndash;&ndash;he openly
flies the black flag. But this pious fellow&ndash;&ndash;well, he&rsquo;s got me
guessing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the
young men. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our assistant pastor,&rdquo; he said musingly, as
he watched the man go down the walk. &ldquo;Nice young fellow,
waiting for a church. He and some of his friends are interested
in a zinc mine we&rsquo;ve been floating, down in the Joplin district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got titles?&rdquo; queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Ketchim smiled affably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine producing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no&ndash;&ndash;not yet. Lots of development work to be done,
you know. Always is. And there&rsquo;s a lot of water in this mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the stock, too, eh?&rdquo; pursued the cruel Harris. &ldquo;Got
any ore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t struck the deposit yet, although we expect to
soon. But,&rdquo; glancing up at the clock on the mantel, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
have to be going over to Sunday school now. And I want that
little girl to go with Marjorie. Fellows,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s face became
deeply serious, &ldquo;I have no doubt you are both church
members?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim&rsquo;s searching glance;
but Harris frankly met the question. &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he asserted,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re both rank heathen. And I&rsquo;m a dyed-in-the-wool atheist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; cried Ketchim, &ldquo;how can you say that, when
you see the goodness of the Lord on every hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reed, I believe,&rdquo; continued the imperturbable Harris, waving
a hand toward his friend, &ldquo;has philosophical leanings&ndash;&ndash;New
Thought, Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and
all that. But I&rsquo;ve got to be shown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought,&rdquo;
said Harris. &ldquo;Been pretty busy, you know. Lots of time for
that later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page48' name='book3_page48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what so many say,&rdquo; replied Ketchim sadly; &ldquo;and
then comes the awful voice of the Lord, &lsquo;This night thy soul
shall be required of thee!&rsquo; Fellows, I want to pray for you;
and I want you both to promise me that you will take up seriously
the consideration of your souls&rsquo; welfare. It&rsquo;s too grave a
subject for jest,&rdquo; addressing himself solemnly to the grinning
Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old man,&rdquo; laughed Harris. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t dig up
any Presbyterian tracts for me. I&rsquo;ve got a living witness to&ndash;&ndash;well,
to something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen,
and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe she&rsquo;s dug nearer to bottom facts than
any of you. So when I&rsquo;m ready to discuss my soul&rsquo;s welfare
I&rsquo;ll just consult her, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed,
&ldquo;what do you intend to do with the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo; Reed answered abstractedly. &ldquo;Send her to
a boarding school, I guess. At least, that&rsquo;s what I told the old
man I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you said before,&rdquo; Ketchim returned. &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let me make a suggestion. My daughter Marjorie
leaves Tuesday for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been
attending Madam Elwin&rsquo;s Select School for Girls. Suppose
you go with her&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m too busy, myself&ndash;&ndash;and take Carmen. It&rsquo;s
only a few hours&rsquo; ride by boat down the river. And the school
is without equal. This is Marjorie&rsquo;s third year there, and she&rsquo;s
simply in love with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting
the effect of his words, went on briskly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new
company its existence, to that girl. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they do
something to show their gratitude? I say, it is no more than
right that the new company should support her while she is in
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! not a half-bad idea,&rdquo; commented Harris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; continued Ketchim earnestly. &ldquo;Now fix
up everything with her as regards the transfer of the mine to
the new company, and then let her go with Marjorie to the
Elwin school. We can, if you like, make some agreement with
her to the effect that when the company is on its feet and she
is receiving dividends, she shall return what it may advance
for her schooling, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better accept the suggestion, Reed,&rdquo; put in Harris.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I&rsquo;ll take
her and Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting
her located right.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page49' name='book3_page49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Reed continued to reflect. He was hardly in a position to
refuse such an offer. Besides, he was really leaving her in
charge of Harris. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;in that case I
could leave for California to-morrow night. That matter is
pressing hard&ndash;&ndash;all right, I accept the company&rsquo;s offer. It&rsquo;s no
more than is due the girl, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied Ketchim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the necessary arrangements
at once. And now let&rsquo;s go over to church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if
she was dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for
Girls, with Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on
the Overland Limited, hurrying to the far West, was musing
dubiously at frequent intervals on Ketchim&rsquo;s rather conflicting
statements, which, until left to this enforced leisure, he had not
had time to try to reconcile. At the same time, while Harris was
loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin on the astonishing
mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat deeply immersed
in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simit&iacute;
Development Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; said Ketchim, who for some minutes had
been quietly scanning his youthful lawyer, &ldquo;Ames knows nothing
about the formation of this company, but Harris and Reed
are not to know that; and we&rsquo;re going to keep Ames in ignorance
of all our plans. With the first sales of stock&ndash;&ndash;and they&rsquo;ve
already begun&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll return him his Molino investment. Nezlett
wired me this morning that he&rsquo;s sure to sell a big block to
the Leveridges, that they&rsquo;re mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen. We&rsquo;ll use the girl for just such purposes. That&rsquo;s
one reason why I wanted her handy, so&rsquo;s we could reach her
at any time. She makes a star impression; and with her as an
advertisement we&rsquo;ll sell a million dollars&rsquo; worth of stock, and
no trouble at all! She&rsquo;s got that honest look that&rsquo;s convincing.
And she can tell a story that beats the Arabian Nights! Ames
has given me a week to explain, or make good his investment.
By that time we&rsquo;ll have the Leveridges sold for twice his investment,
and we&rsquo;ll just pay him off and remove him. Meantime,
you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the
best line of talk you&rsquo;re capable of. I&rsquo;ve got sixteen hundred
dollars to give &rsquo;em on that note; and that&rsquo;ll secure more time,
until the sales of stock are enough to pay it all up. Perhaps
Uncle Ted will advance me enough to take up the note when he
hears about La Libertad. And, say, you see brother James,
and shake the club over him until he disgorges that check he
got from Miss Leveridge. You can hand him a scare that he
won&rsquo;t get over. By George, old man! things have taken a great
turn, eh? Why, I can just see Simit&iacute; stock sales humping these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page50' name='book3_page50'></a>50</span>
next few months. Oh, Miss Honeywell,&rdquo; calling to his cashier,
&ldquo;bring me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino&ndash;&ndash;I mean,
to Simit&iacute;. Make a new account for that now.&rdquo; Then, again
addressing Cass: &ldquo;Come with me to the football game this
afternoon. We can discuss plans there as well as here. Gee
whiz, but I feel great!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>
</div>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of
Guamoc&oacute; to the whirring activities of New York was like
a plunge into the maelstrom, and left her groping blindly
in the effort to adapt herself to the changed order. There was
little in her former mode of existence that could be transferred
to her new environment, and she felt that she was starting life
like a new-born babe. For days, even weeks, she moved about
dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession
of material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex
civilization, so common to her associates, but scarcely even
dreamed of by her in her former home, despite the preparation
which Jos&egrave; had tried to give her. The Elwin school was small,
its student-body seldom numbering more than fifty, and in it
Carmen found herself hedged about by restrictions which in a
way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her environment and
afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.</p>
<p>But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the
length of her stay in the school almost calculable. Little by
little the girl saw the forces developing which she knew must
effect her dismissal; little by little, as Madam Elwin&rsquo;s manner
toward her became less gracious, and her schoolmates made
fewer efforts to conceal from her the fact that she was not one
of them, Carmen prepared for the inevitable. Six months after
the girl&rsquo;s enrollment, Madam Elwin terminated her series of
disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request that he come at
once and remove his charge from the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have repeatedly said, Mr. Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.
And after these months of disappointing effort to instruct
her, I am forced to throw up my hands in despair and send
for you.&rdquo; Madam Elwin tapped nervously with a dainty
finger upon the desk before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons
have you, Madam, for&ndash;&ndash;ah, for requesting her removal?&rdquo;
asked the very Reverend Dr. William Jurges, who, having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page51' name='book3_page51'></a>51</span>
come up to the city to attend a meeting of the directors of the
Simit&iacute; company, had accepted Ketchim&rsquo;s invitation to first accompany
him on his flying trip to Conway-on-the-Hudson, in
response to Madam Elwin&rsquo;s peremptory summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied that worthy personage with a show of
exasperation, &ldquo;I consider her influence upon the young ladies
here quite detrimental. Our school, while non-sectarian, is at
least Christian. Miss Carmen is not. Where she got her views,
I can not imagine. At first she made frequent mention of a
Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town, in South
America. But of late she has grown very reserved&ndash;&ndash;I might
say, sullen, and talks but little. Her views, however, are certainly
not Catholic. In her class work she has become impossible.
She refuses to accept a large part of our instruction.
Her answers to examination questions are wholly in accord
with her peculiar views, and hence quite apart from the texts.
For that reason she fails to make any grades, excepting in
mathematics and the languages. She utterly refuses to accept
any religious instruction whatsoever. She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks&ndash;&ndash;or used to at first&ndash;&ndash;continually about
God. But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr. Jurges.
She is a free-thinker, in the strictest sense. And as such, we
can not consent to her remaining longer with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;quite so, Madam, quite so,&rdquo; returned the clergyman,
in his unconsciously pompous manner. &ldquo;Doubtless the child&rsquo;s
thought became&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;contaminated ere she was placed in your
care. But&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;I have heard so much from our good friend,
Mr. Ketchim, regarding this young girl, that&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;I should
like exceedingly to see and talk with her&ndash;&ndash;if it might be&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure,&rdquo; interposed
Ketchim. &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he suggested, addressing the lady, &ldquo;we
let him talk with her, while I discuss with you our recently
acquired mine in South America, and the advisability of an
investment with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing
one of the several buttons in the desk. &ldquo;Bring Miss Carmen,&rdquo;
she directed, to the maid who answered the summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; interrupted Dr. Jurges; &ldquo;but may I go to her?
Ah&ndash;&ndash;it would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago,&rdquo; volunteered
the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take the doctor there,&rdquo; returned Madam Elwin, with
a gesture of dismissal.</p>
<p>At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human
voice and the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through
the long hall and fell upon the ears of the clergyman.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page52' name='book3_page52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; said the maid, answering his unspoken
thought. &ldquo;She often comes up to the chapel and sings for
hours at a time&ndash;&ndash;alone. The chapel is down there,&rdquo; pointing to
the end of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;leave me,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I will proceed
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man
tiptoed to the chapel door. There he stopped and stood listening.
The girl was singing in Spanish, and he could not understand
the words. But they would have meant nothing to him
then. It was the voice upon which they were borne that held
him. The song was a weird lament that had come down to the
children of Simit&iacute; from the hard days of the <i>Conquistadores</i>. It
voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves; its sad, unvarying
minor echoed their smothered moans under the cruel goad;
on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their piteous
cries were carried to heaven&rsquo;s deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then
died away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish
lust.</p>
<p>The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.
Nor could he readily associate the voice, which again
and again he could not distinguish from the flute-like tones
of the organ, with the sordidness and grime of material, fleshly
existence. He entered softly and took a seat in the shadow of
a pillar. The clear, sweet voice of the young girl flowed over
him like celestial balm. Song after song she sang. Some
were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English; others
were sacred in character. He wondered deeply, as the girl
mused over these; yet he knew not that they were her own
compositions. Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at
length, and he got softly to his feet and moved away from
the pillar, that he might see from what manner of being
issued such unbroken harmony. But in his eagerness his foot
struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.</p>
<p>The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked
over the organ at the intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the clergyman, advancing in
some embarrassment. &ldquo;I was listening to your singing&ndash;&ndash;uninvited,
but none the less appreciative. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, please!&rdquo; cried the girl, hastily stooping over and
fumbling with her shoes. The doctor laughed genially, as he
grasped the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took them off,&rdquo; she explained hurriedly. &ldquo;I am not yet
accustomed to them. I never wore shoes until I left Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;
Her face was scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with
a little laugh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page53' name='book3_page53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the
shapely figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully
expressive face. The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned
him a frank smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to see me?&rdquo; she said, after waiting in vain for
him to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;yes, certainly&ndash;&ndash;that is, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; stammered
the doctor. &ldquo;I did request permission of Madam Elwin
to make your acquaintance. We have heard so much about
you. I am Doctor Jurges, an Episcopal clergyman.&rdquo; His
sentences issued like blasts from an engine exhaust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Carmen Ariza,&rdquo; said the girl, extending her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;quite so, quite so,&rdquo; blustered the doctor, clearing his
throat noisily. &ldquo;Let us be seated. Ah&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;you have a remarkable
voice. It gives evidence of careful cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the girl simply. &ldquo;It has never had any
cultivation. It is natural for me to sing. And my poor organ-playing
is what I have picked up myself these six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man regarded her with amazement. &ldquo;Remarkable!&rdquo;
he murmured.</p>
<p>The girl looked up into his face searchingly. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;should every one up here think it remarkable when a
human mind is clear enough to be a transparency for God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no
more startled. He cleared his throat violently again; then
fumbled nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.
These he poised upon the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose,
and through them turned a penetrating glance upon the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! yes,&rdquo; said he at length; &ldquo;quite so, quite so! And&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question&ndash;&ndash;your
religious instruction&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;may I ask from whom you
received it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From God,&rdquo; was the immediate and frank reply.</p>
<p>The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! yes, quite so, quite so! All real instruction descendeth
from above. But&ndash;&ndash;your religious views&ndash;&ndash;I believe they
are not considered&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;quite evangelical, are they? By your
present associates, that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; looking up with a queer little smile, &ldquo;I am not persecuting
them for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; with a jerky little laugh. &ldquo;Assuredly not! H&rsquo;m!
I judge the persecution has come from the other side, has it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not speak of that,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;They do
not understand&ndash;&ndash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page54' name='book3_page54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! no, quite so&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;may I ask why you think
they do not understand? May not you be in error, instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that which I believe is not true,&rdquo; the girl replied evenly,
&ldquo;it will fail under the test of demonstration. Their beliefs
have long since failed under such test&ndash;&ndash;and yet they still cling
jealously to them, and try to force them upon all who disagree
with them. I am a heretic, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;yes, I see. But&ndash;&ndash;it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one&rsquo;s views indiscriminately
to the Almighty&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;I regret to note that you are not
wholly free from this error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand, I think,&rdquo; she quickly returned.
&ldquo;I put every view, every thought, every idea to the test. If good
is the result, I know that the thought or idea comes from the
source of all good, God. The views I hold are those which I
have time and again tested&ndash;&ndash;and some of them have withstood
trials which I think you would regard as unusually severe.&rdquo;
Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid experience
in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simit&iacute;, and the fire through which she had passed in her first
hours in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and
creeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first
through his spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while
his bushy eyebrows moved up and down with such comicality
that Carmen could scarcely refrain from laughing. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!
quite so. Ah&ndash;&ndash;suppose you relate to me some of the tests to
which your views have been subjected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned firmly; &ldquo;those experiences were only
states of consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.
Why rehearse them? They were human, and so, unreal. Why
go back now and give them the appearance of reality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unreal! H&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;then you do not regard untoward experience
as given us by God for the testing of our faith, I
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I think we had better not
talk about these things, Doctor. You are a preacher. Your
views are not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;ah,&rdquo; blustered the clergyman, assuming a more
paternal air, &ldquo;we&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;would not for a moment cause you
embarrassment, Miss Carmen! But&ndash;&ndash;in fact, Madam Elwin has&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;expressed
her disapproval of your views&ndash;&ndash;your religious
ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;the good
lady regrets&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?&rdquo; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page55' name='book3_page55'></a>55</span>
girl, turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking
divine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! well, hardly so&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the girl calmly, &ldquo;I know it, and I wish to go.
I have been waiting only to see the way open. I do not wish to
remain longer in an atmosphere where ignorance and false
belief stifle all real progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.
He had forgotten that he had not been talking with one of
his own age. The fact suddenly pressed upon him. &ldquo;How old
are you?&rdquo; he blurted.</p>
<p>Carmen could not help laughing. But if her clear mental
gaze penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the
theological assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get
close to the heart of the man, she did not indicate it further.
&ldquo;I am nearly sixteen,&rdquo; was her only reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;just a child! My dear girl,&rdquo; he continued,
laying a hand indulgently upon hers, &ldquo;I will advise with
Madam Elwin, and will endeavor to convince her that&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;that
your spiritual welfare, if I may so put it, requires that you
be not turned adrift at this critical, transitorial period of your
life. We must all be patient, while we strive to counteract the&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;the
pernicious teaching to which you were exposed
before&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;before becoming enrolled in this excellent school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.
There was something of pity in the expression of her
beautiful face, of tender sympathy for those who seek the
light, and who must some day find it, but whose progress is as
yet hampered by the human mind&rsquo;s unreasoning adherence to
the stepping-stones over which it has been passing through
the dark waters of ignorance. &ldquo;Then, Doctor,&rdquo; she said calmly,
&ldquo;you know what I have been taught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;that is, vaguely. But&ndash;&ndash;suppose you inform
me briefly.&rdquo; He was beginning to be sensible of having
passed judgment upon the girl without first according her a
hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she smiled up at him, &ldquo;I have been taught the very
hardest thing in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, indeed! Ah, quite so&ndash;&ndash;and that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;to think!&rdquo; He again clutched at his mental
poise. &ldquo;Well, yes, quite so! But&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;is it not the function of
all our schools to teach us to think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the girl decidedly; &ldquo;not to teach us to
think, but to cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly
called &lsquo;authority&rsquo;! I find we are not to reason, and particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page56' name='book3_page56'></a>56</span>
about religious matters, but to accept, to let those &lsquo;in authority&rsquo;
think for us. Is it not so? Are you not even now seeking to
make me accept your religious views? And why? Because
they are true? Oh, no; but because you believe them true&ndash;&ndash;whether
they are or not. Have you demonstrated their truth?
Do you come to me with proofs? Do your religious views rest
upon anything but the human mind&rsquo;s undemonstrated interpretation
of the Bible? And yet you can not prove that interpretation
true, even though you would force it upon such as I,
who may differ from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began the doctor nervously. But Carmen continued
without heeding the interruption:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured
here on &lsquo;The Prime Function of Education.&rsquo; He said it was
the development of the individual, and that the chief end of
educational work was the promotion of originality. And yet,
when I think along original lines&ndash;&ndash;when I depart from stereotyped
formul&aelig;, and state boldly that I will not accept any
religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman Catholic,
that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily
created and recognized by a God who by very necessity can not
know evil&ndash;&ndash;then I am accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker;
and the authorities take steps to remove me, lest my
influence contaminate the rest of the pupils!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;yes, quite so&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;I think&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, a preacher, think?&rdquo; the girl went on hurriedly.
&ldquo;Or do you only <i>think</i> that you think? Do you still believe
with the world that the passing of a stream of human thought,
or a series of mental pictures, through your mentality constitutes
<i>real</i> thinking? Do you believe that jumping from
one human mental concept to another twenty-four hours a
day constitutes thinking? Have you yet learned to distinguish
between God&rsquo;s thoughts and their opposites, human thoughts?
Do you know what Jesus taught? Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity? Do you heal the
sick, raise the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free
from the mesmerism of evil? If so, then you are unevangelical,
too, and you and I are both heretics, and we&rsquo;d better&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;d
better leave this building at once, for I find that the Inquisition
is still alive, even in America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, and caught her breath. Her face was flushed,
and her whole body quivered with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inquisition! Why, my dear young lady, this is a
Christian nation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;you have still much to learn from
the pagan nations that have gone before.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page57' name='book3_page57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his
glasses that he might see her more clearly. &ldquo;My dear child,
you have been thinking too much, and too seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;but you preachers have not
been thinking enough, nor even half seriously. Oh,&rdquo; she went
on, while her eyes grew moist, and ever and again her throat
filled, &ldquo;I had expected so much in this great country! And I
have found so little&ndash;&ndash;so little that is not wholly material, mechanical,
and unreal! I had imagined that, with all your learning
and progress, which Padre Jos&egrave; told me about, you would
know God much better than we in the darkened South. But
your god is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal
things that can be bought with money. Some one wrote, in a
recent newspaper, that America&rsquo;s god was &lsquo;mud and mammon!&rsquo;
What do I find the girls here in this school talking about but
dress, and society, and the unreal, passing pleasures of the
physical senses! Do they know God? No&ndash;&ndash;nor want to! Nor
do the preachers! There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the
city. Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and
sometimes an Episcopalian, or a Methodist. What is the
result? Confusion&ndash;&ndash;religious confusion. Each has a different
concept of God; yet they all believe Him the creator of a man
of flesh and bones, a man who was originally made perfect,
but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and perfect God
who made him. Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach! How could a good God create anything that could
fall? And if He could, and did, then He knew in advance that
the man would fall, and so God becomes responsible, not man.
Oh, Doctor, is it possible that you believe such stuff? How
can you! how can you! Is it any wonder that, holding such
awful views, you preachers have no longer the power to heal
the sick? Do you not know that, in order to heal the sick, one
must become spiritually-minded? But no one who holds to
the puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology
can possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus
said we should all do if we followed him&ndash;&ndash;really understood
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child&ndash;&ndash;you really are quite inconsistent&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inconsistent! What a charge for an orthodox preacher to
bring! Let us see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God
made man in His image and likeness&ndash;&ndash;the image and likeness
of spirit. Very well. Spirit, God, is eternal, immortal. Then
while He exists can His image fade away, or die? Can or
would God cause it to do so? Can or would He destroy His
own reflection? And could that image, always being like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page58' name='book3_page58'></a>58</span>
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless
God first manifested these things? And if God did manifest
them, then, perforce, the image would <i>have</i> to do likewise.
But, in that case, could God justly punish His image for faithfully
reflecting its original? Consistent! Oh, it is you preachers,
lacking sufficient spirituality to correctly interpret the
Scriptures, who are wildly, childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose and faced the clergyman. &ldquo;I did not mean to
condemn you, Doctor,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;I wage no warfare
with persons or things. My opposition is directed only against
the entrenched human thought that makes men spiritually
blind and holds them in the mesmeric chains of evil. I am
young, as you reckon years, but I have had much experience
in the realm of thought&ndash;&ndash;and it is there that all experience is
wrought out before it becomes externalized. I have told you,
my teacher was God. He used as a channel a priest, who
came years ago to my little home town of Simit&iacute;, in far-off
Colombia. His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief
of evil as a power, real and intelligent. He began to see the
light; but he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his
demonstration and break the imaginary bonds which held
him. He saw, but he did not prove. He will, some day. And,
Doctor, you and everybody else will have to do the same.
For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious falsehoods ever
voiced, every human being will have to take every step that he
took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove all
that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken
lives into graves that do <i>not</i> afford a gateway to immortal life!
My God is infinite, eternal, unchanging mind. The god of the
preachers, judging from their sermons preached here, is a
human, mental concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing
good and evil, and changing with every caprice of their own
unstable mentalities. My religion is the Christianity of the
Master, love. Oh, how this poor world needs it, yearns for it!
The love that demonstrates the nothingness of evil, and drives
it out of human experience! The love that heals the sick,
raises the dead, binds up broken hearts! The love that will
not quench the religious instincts of children, and falsely educate
them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches them to
recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then shows
them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did. My God is truth.
Is truth real? Ah, yes, you say. But error is the opposite of
truth. Then can error, evil, be real? No, not if you will be
consistent. Again, God is infinite. But God is spirit. Then
all is spirit and spirit&rsquo;s manifestation&ndash;&ndash;is it not true? What,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page59' name='book3_page59'></a>59</span>
then, becomes of the evil that men hug to their bosoms, even
while it gnaws into their hearts? It is the opposite of good,
of mind, of truth, God. And the opposite of truth is supposition.
Is it not so? And the supposition is&ndash;&ndash;where? In your
mentality. And you can put it out whenever you are willing
to drop your ceremonials and your theories, and will open your
mentality to truth, which will make you free, even as the
Master said. That is my religion, Doctor. Those are the religious
views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate. Am I a heretic? Or unevangelical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply. Then,
as he remained silent, she went up to him and held out her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not care to talk with me longer, I think,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps we may meet again. But, as regards Madam Elwin&rsquo;s
wishes, you may tell her that I shall leave the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you&ndash;&ndash;have you been fitting yourself for any&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;particular
work&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;for your support, that is?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor gravely, as he took the proffered hand. He had been
swept off his feet by the girl&rsquo;s conversation, and he had not the
temerity to combat her views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;I have been working daily to gain
a better understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through
them, of God. My single aim has been to acquire &lsquo;that mind
which was in Christ Jesus.&rsquo; And I have no other business than
to reflect it to my fellow-men in a life of service. That is my
Father&rsquo;s business, and I am working with Him. My mission
in this world is to manifest God. I am going out now to do
that, and <i>to show what love will do</i>. God will use me, and He
will supply my every need. And now, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.
Soon the same song which he had heard as he entered the
room rose again through the stillness. A strong emotion
seemed to possess him. He started toward the girl; checked
himself; and stood hesitating. Then his lips set, and he
turned and walked slowly from the room.</p>
<p>In the hall two women were approaching, and as they
drew near he recognized one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both
hands, &ldquo;my dear Mrs. Hawley-Crowles! It is not so long since
we met at the Weston&rsquo;s. But what, may I ask, brings you
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my sister, Mrs. Charles Reed, Doctor Jurges. We
have come to, make a duty call on Mr. Reed&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, the
little South American savage, you know. Madam Elwin said
she was up here with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page60' name='book3_page60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, quite so&ndash;&ndash;er, in the chapel, I believe,&rdquo; said the
clergyman, his face becoming suddenly grave. &ldquo;I would return
with you, but my time is&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;so limited.&rdquo; He bowed low,
with his hand in the breast of his long frock coat, and passed
on down the hall.</p>
<p>As the women approached the door of the chapel through
which came Carmen&rsquo;s low singing they turned and looked at
each other inquiringly. Then they quietly entered the doorway
and stood listening. Carmen, concealed behind the organ,
did not see them.</p>
<p>The song stopped, and Mrs. Hawley-Crowles went quickly
to the organ. Bending over it, she gazed down into the face
of the startled girl. &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Get up
and let me see what sort of a looking creature you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose, and Mrs. Reed came forward and gave her a
tempered greeting. Then Mrs. Hawley-Crowles fell back and
stared at the girl from head to foot. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said to
her sister, &ldquo;this is the first glimpse I&rsquo;ve had of your husband&rsquo;s
discovery. I was out of the city when he brought her to my
house, you remember. But,&rdquo; turning again to Carmen, &ldquo;sing
that song over, dear, please&ndash;&ndash;the one you were singing just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
drew her sister to the rear of the room. &ldquo;It will sound
better back here,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs. Reed.
&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; she said, nodding her head sententiously, &ldquo;you had a
pearl, and you threw it away. That girl there is our social
fortune! Her voice, and her face&ndash;&ndash;why, with our ward&ndash;&ndash;this
beautiful, gifted, South American owner of a famous mine&ndash;&ndash;as
a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the Ames to our
terms! She goes back with us to-night! You&rsquo;ve been blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor
Jurges in the office below had reached a conclusion. &ldquo;A young
lady of&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;invincible will,&rdquo; the doctor had observed; &ldquo;and
already&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;decidedly mature, despite her tender years.
Should she&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;assume leadership over the pupils of your
school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be disquieting.
There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said. But, what astonishes me is&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;that this strange
cult should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical
America! Astonishing&ndash;&ndash;and so unfortunate! The girl is utterly&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing
her from the school can not be questioned. Do you
not agree with me, Mr. Ketchim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; asserted the latter gentleman with great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page61' name='book3_page61'></a>61</span>
seriousness, while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin&rsquo;s
written order for a hundred shares of Simit&iacute; stock which he
held in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the lady with a determined nod of
her head; &ldquo;I shall request Mrs. Reed to take her to-day.&rdquo;
Then, with a proper sense of what it meant to have the moral
support of such an eminent divine as Doctor Jurges, she rang
for her maid and bade her summon Mrs. Reed and the girl.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the
checkerboard of life, and slept that night once more under
the spacious roof of the wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles,
on Riverside Drive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>
</div>
<p>As has been said, Carmen&rsquo;s six months in the Elwin school
had been a period of slow adjustment to the changed
order. She had brought into this new world a charm of
unsophistication, an ingenuous <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, such as only an untrammeled
spirit nourished in an elemental civilization like
that of primitive Simit&iacute; could develop. Added to this was the
zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had come
as a message-bearer to a people with a great need. Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in
the great States were not so different, after all, from those of
her own unprogressive country. Her next was one of sad disillusionment,
as the fact slowly dawned upon her trusting
thought that the busy denizens of her new environment took
no interest whatsoever in her message. And then her joy and
brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to find her
strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.
She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation. She had come utterly free of dogma or creed,
and happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious
caste. Her Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of
the Master&rsquo;s words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered
in the warm atmosphere of love for mankind. Her
concept of the Christ stirred no thought within her of intolerance
toward those who might hold differing views; nor did
it raise interposing barriers within her own mind, nor evoke
those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the souls
of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.
Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page62' name='book3_page62'></a>62</span>
saw the advent of that day when all mankind would obey the
commands of Jesus, and do the works which he did, even to
the complete spiritualization and dematerializing of all human
thought. And her burning desire was to hasten the coming
of that glad hour.</p>
<p>The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity
was steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity
and progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her
slowly. And with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of
the fine edge of her enthusiasm. She grew quiet as the days
passed, and drew away from her companions into her thought.
With her increasing sense of isolation came at length a great
longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and return to her
native environment and the sympathy and tender solicitude of
her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jos&egrave;. But, alas! that was at
present impossible. Indeed, she could not be certain now of
their whereabouts. A great war was raging in Colombia, and
she knew not what fate had befallen her loved ones. To her
many letters directed to Simit&iacute; there had come back no reply.
Even Harris, who had written again and again to both Rosendo
and Jos&egrave;, had received no word from them in return.
Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing and heart-sickness
seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.</p>
<p>Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned
squarely upon the foul brood of evil suggestions crowding
upon her and, as if they were fell spirits from the nether
world, bade them begone. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;I know
you for what you are&ndash;&ndash;<i>nothing</i>! You seemed to use Padre Jos&egrave;,
but you can&rsquo;t use me! God is everywhere&ndash;&ndash;right here! He is
my life; and you, evil thoughts, can&rsquo;t make me think He isn&rsquo;t!
I am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will <i>not</i>
witness to His opposite, evil! My life is filled with harmony;
and you, evil thoughts, can&rsquo;t reverse that fact! God has
brought me here, else I would not have come, for He is the
cause of all that is. It is for me to stand and see His glory.
No! no!&rdquo; as she paced about the room and seemed to ward off
the assaults of an invisible enemy, &ldquo;there is no power apart
from Him! On that I stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in the lull of battle, &ldquo;Father divine, I thank Thee
that Thou hast heard me. And now I lay my all upon the altar
of love, and throw myself upon Thy thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day, despite continued attacks from error&ndash;&ndash;despite,
too, the veiled slights and covert insinuations of her
schoolmates, to whom the girl&rsquo;s odd views and utter refusal to
share their accustomed conversation, their interest in mundane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page63' name='book3_page63'></a>63</span>
affairs, their social aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length
made her quite unwelcome&ndash;&ndash;Carmen steadily, and without heed
of diverting gesture, brought into captivity every thought to
the obedience of her Christ-principle, and threw off for all
time the dark cloud of pessimism which human belief and the
mesmerism of events had drawn over her joyous spirit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in
the school; but Ketchim had visited her often&ndash;&ndash;not, however,
alone, but always with one or more prospective purchasers of
Simit&iacute; stock in tow whom he sought to influence favorably
through Carmen&rsquo;s interesting conversation about her native
land. Harris came every Sunday, and the girl welcomed the
great, blundering fellow as the coming of the day. At times he
would obtain Madam Elwin&rsquo;s permission to take the girl up
to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he would
abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her na&iuml;ve
wonder and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated
by it. He was the only one now with whom she felt any
degree of freedom, and in his presence her restraint vanished
and her airy gaiety again welled forth with all its wonted
fervor. Once, shortly after Carmen had been enrolled, Harris
took her to a concert by the New York Symphony Orchestra.
But in the midst of the program, after sitting in silent rapture,
the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be taken out.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; she sobbed as, outside the door, she hid
her tear-stained face in his coat; &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t! It was
heavenly! Oh, it was God that we heard&ndash;&ndash;it was God!&rdquo; And
the astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up
emotion as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.</p>
<p>With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came
a rapid expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and
the young lady who left the Elwin school that bright spring
afternoon under the protection of the self-sufficient Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
was very far from being the inquisitive, unabashed
little girl who had so greatly shocked the good Sister Superior
by her heretical views some six months before. The sophistication
engendered by her intercourse with the pupils and instructors
in the school had transformed the eager, trusting
little maid, who could see only good into a mature woman,
who, though her trust remained unshaken, nevertheless had a
better understanding of the seeming power &ldquo;that lusteth against
the spirit,&rdquo; and whose idea of her mission had been deepened
into a grave sense of responsibility. She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality
in the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page64' name='book3_page64'></a>64</span>
over those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality
had as yet scarcely penetrated. Her thought had begun to
shape a definite purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer,
but the message must be set forth in her life conduct. The
futility of promiscuous verbal delivery of the message to whomsoever
might cross her path had been made patent. Jesus
taught&ndash;&ndash;and then proved. She must do likewise, and let her
deeds attest the truth of her words. And from the day that
she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her, she had
consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the Master&rsquo;s
life and words, if happily she might acquire &ldquo;that mind&rdquo; which
he so wondrously expressed.</p>
<p>But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration
was by no means sudden. There were times when she could
not restrain the impulse to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively
set forth by the preachers and lecturers whom Madam
Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who, unlike Jesus,
first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life beyond
the grave. Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst
of an eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian
divine of considerable repute, and asked him why it
was that, as he seemed to set forth, God had changed His mind
after creating spiritual man, and had created a man of dust.
She had later repented her scandalous conduct in sackcloth and
ashes; but it did not prevent her from abruptly leaving the
chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another divine, this time
a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his theories of
endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at length
upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are God-sent
for mankind&rsquo;s chastisement and discipline.</p>
<p>Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions
and beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise
superior to them. But her experience with the preachers
wrought within her a strong determination henceforth to listen
to no religious propaganda whatsoever, to give no further heed
to current theological beliefs, and to enter no church edifice,
regardless of the tenets of the sect worshiping within its
precincts. The wisdom of this decision she left for the future
to determine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;my only mission is to manifest the divine,
not to waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers,
who fail utterly to prove the truth of their teachings! Oh,
how the world needs love&ndash;&ndash;just love! And I am going to love
it with the selfless love that comes from God, and destroys
error and the false beliefs that become externalized in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page65' name='book3_page65'></a>65</span>
human consciousness as sickness, failure, old age, and death!
Love, love, love&ndash;&ndash;it is mankind&rsquo;s greatest need! Why, if the
preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity
is love! It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom
of all sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the
one Father of Christ Jesus! Christianity is aflame with love!
Oh, God&ndash;&ndash;take me out into the world, and let me show it what
love can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple
of the Christ&ndash;&ndash;aye, had heard it long before the solicitous,
fluttering little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl&rsquo;s
unevangelical views were inimical to the best interests of her
very select school. The social ambitions of the wealthy Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles threw wide the portals of the world to Carmen,
and she entered, wide-eyed and wondering. Nor did she return
until the deepest recesses of the human mind had revealed
to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly emptiness of
reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>
</div>
<p>Mrs. James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive
than her sister, had seized upon Carmen with avidity
bred of hope long deferred. The scourge of years
of fruitless social striving had rendered her desperate, and she
would have staged a ballet on her dining table, with her own
ample self as <i>premi&egrave;re danseuse</i>, did the attraction but promise
recognition from the blas&eacute; members of fashionable New York&rsquo;s
ultra-conservative set. From childhood she had looked eagerly
forward through the years with an eye single to such recognition
as life&rsquo;s desideratum. To this end she had bartered both
youth and beauty with calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles
money bags; only to weep floods of angry tears when
the bargain left her social status unchanged, and herself tied
to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished name wholly neutralized
the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold. Fortunately
for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she
had long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon
the stricken widow had him carefully incinerated and his
ashes tenderly deposited in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which
her architect had taken oath cost more than the showy Ames
vault by many thousands. The period of decorous mourning
past, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds and threw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page66' name='book3_page66'></a>66</span>
herself again into the terrific competition for social standing,
determined this time that it should be a warfare to the death.</p>
<p>And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr. Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest. She complied, and had returned with restored
health and determination just as her sister came up from South
America, bringing the odd little &ldquo;savage&rdquo; whom Reed had discovered
in the wilds of Guamoc&oacute;. A prolonged week-end at
Newport, the last of the summer season, accounted for her
absence from the city when Reed brought Carmen to her house,
where he and his wife were making their temporary abode.
Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the Elwin
school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she
seemed to see a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look like a desperate chance, I admit,&rdquo; she said,
when recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve played every other card in my hand; and now this
girl is going to be either a trump or a joker. All we need is
a word from the Beaubien, and the following week will see
an invitation at our door from Mrs. J. Wilton Ames. The
trick is to reach the Beaubien. That I calculate to do through
Carmen. And I&rsquo;m going to introduce the girl as an Inca princess.
Why not? It will make a tremendous hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto
she had lacked the one essential to social success, money.
In addition, she had committed the egregious blunder of marrying
for love. And now that the honeymoon had become a
memory, and she faced again her growing ambition, with a
struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to aid
her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand
a year, which she had inherited from her mother, only an
aggravation. True, in time her wandering father would pass
away; and there was no doubt that his vast property would
fall to his daughters, his only living kin. But at present, in
view of his aggressively good health and disregard for his
relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into
the social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve
her high ambition.</p>
<p>Just why Mrs. Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen
a means of reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and
through her the leader of the most exclusive social set in the
metropolis, is difficult to say. But thus does the human mind
often seek to further its own dubious aims through guileless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page67' name='book3_page67'></a>67</span>
innocence and trust. Perhaps Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had likewise
a slight trace of that clairvoyance of wisdom which so
characterized the girl. But with this difference, that she knew
not why she was led to adopt certain means; while Carmen,
penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own
dominant thought. Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now
the stone before the door of their hope, and Carmen the lever
by which these calculating women intended it should be moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Beaubien, my dear,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
to her inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely
away from New York, &ldquo;is J. Wilton Ames&rsquo;s very particular
friend, of long standing. As I told you, I have recently been
going through my late unpleasant husband&rsquo;s effects, and have
unearthed letters and memoranda which throw floods of light
upon Jim&rsquo;s early indiscretions and his association with both
the Beaubien and Ames. Jim once told me, in a burst of
alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton&rsquo;s
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless
gratitude, as well as for never permitting him to darken her
door again. Now I have never met the Beaubien. Few women
have. But I dare say she knows all about us. However, the
point that concerns us now is this: she has a hold on Ames,
and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints to him
that his wife&rsquo;s dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately
revised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit
was not to be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique. It
was not as social dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan
city where polite society is infinitely complex in its
make-up such a position can scarcely be said to exist. It was
rather as an influence that she was felt, an influence never
seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly inexplicable, working
now through this channel, now through that, and effecting
changes in the social complexion of conservative New York that
were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention. Particularly
was her power felt in the narrow circle over which
Mrs. J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her
husband&rsquo;s aristocratic descent, and the latter&rsquo;s bursting coffers
and supremacy in the realm of finance.</p>
<p>Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman
would have been short-lived. But, whatever else might be said
of her, the Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively
uncanny. Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn;
black, wavy, abundant hair; eyes whose dark, liquid depths
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page68' name='book3_page68'></a>68</span>
held unfathomable mysteries; gracious, affable, yet keen as a
razor blade; tender, even sentimental on occasions, with an
infinite capacity for either love or hate, this many-sided woman,
whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or rou&eacute; at her
table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an orphanage
or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival
with the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of
the future. It was said of her that she might have laid down
her life for the man she loved. It is probable that she never
met with one worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding
school, near a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills,
with a French Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her
age. With him she had spent eight increasingly miserable years
in Paris. Then, her withered romance carefully entombed in
the secret places of her heart, she secured a divorce from the
roistering colonel, together with a small settlement, and set
sail for New York to hunt for larger and more valuable game.</p>
<p>With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she
rented an expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the
city, and then settled down to business. Whether she would
have fallen upon bad days or not will never be known, for the
first haul of her widespread net landed a fish of supreme
quality, J. Wilton Ames. On the plea of financial necessity,
she had gone boldly to his office with the deed to a parcel of
worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey shore,
which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon
her when she severed the tie which bound them, and which,
after weeks of careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract
owned by Ames. Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she
reached the inner <i>sanctum</i> of the astonished financier himself
and offered to sell at a ruinous figure. A few well-timed
tears, an expression of angelic innocence on her beautiful face,
a despairing gesture or two with her lovely arms, coupled with
the audacity which she had shown in forcing an entrance into
his office, effected the man&rsquo;s capitulation. She was then in her
twenty-fourth year.</p>
<p>The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted
herself thenceforth with tender consecration to her important
catch. In time Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James
Hawley-Crowles, to call upon the charming Beaubien. In
time, too, as was perfectly natural, a rivalry sprang up between
the men, which the beautiful creature watered so tenderly that
the investments which she was enabled to make under the
direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack&rsquo;s beanstalk,
and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and
take a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page69' name='book3_page69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles
reached the breaking point; and then the former decided that
the woman&rsquo;s bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.
He forthwith drew the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into
certain business deals, with the gentle connivance of the suave
Beaubien herself, and at length sold the man out short and
presented a claim on every dollar he possessed. Hawley-Crowles
awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.
But then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had
to be effected, whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved,
though the man should see the Beaubien no more.</p>
<p>By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion,
and her prowess had been fairly tried. She took a
large house, furnished it like unto a palace, and proceeded to
throw her gauntlet in the face of the impregnable social
caste. There she drew about her a circle of bon-vivants, artists,
litt&eacute;rateurs, politicians, and men of finance&ndash;&ndash;with never
a woman in the group. Yet in her new home she established
a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed
the bounds of respectful decorum. His name was heard no
more on her rosy lips.</p>
<p>Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over
the rare wines and imperial cigars which she furnished,
her guests passed many a tip and prognostication anent the
market, which she in turn quietly transmitted to her brokers.
She came to understand the game thoroughly, and, while it
was her heyday of glorious splendor, she played hard. She
had bartered every priceless gift of nature for gold&ndash;&ndash;and she
made sure that the measure she received in return was full.
Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those
charms would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim
intention that when it came silken ease should compensate
for their loss.</p>
<p>Ten years passed, and the Beaubien&rsquo;s reign continued with
undimmed splendor. In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton
Ames had reached the zenith of her ambitions and was the
acknowledged leader in New York&rsquo;s most fashionable social
circle. These two women never met. But, though the Beaubien
had never sought the entr&eacute;e to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised
a certain control over it through her influence upon
the man Ames. What Mrs. Ames knew of the long-continued
relations between her husband and this woman was never
divulged. And doubtless she was wholly satisfied that his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page70' name='book3_page70'></a>70</span>
wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to
his own methods of obtaining diversion. But rumor was persistent,
maliciously so; and rumor declared that the list of
this envied society dame was not drawn up without the approval
of her husband and the woman with whom his leisure
hours were invariably spent. Hence the hope of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed
wake of the luxurious Beaubien.</p>
<p>Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced
no objection whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles
home. Indeed, she secretly rejoiced that an opportunity had
been so easily afforded for escape from the stifling atmosphere
of the Elwin school, and for entrance into the great world of
people and affairs, where she believed the soil prepared for the
seed she would plant. That dire surprises awaited her, of
which she could not even dream, did not enter her calculations.
Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection
of its worldly, scheming inmates.</p>
<p>In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the
girl strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings,
and to the undreamed of marvels which made for physical
comfort and well-being. Each installment of the ample allowance
which Mrs. Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a
fortune&ndash;&ndash;enough, she thought, to buy the whole town of Simit&iacute;!
Her gowns seemed woven on fairy looms, and often she would
sit for hours, holding them in her lap and reveling in their
richness. Then, when at length she could bring herself to
don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses, she
would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she would exclaim, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be that the girl reflected
there ever lived and dressed as I did in Simit&iacute;! I wonder, oh,
I wonder if Padre Jos&egrave; knew that these things were in the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself
into the hands of the admiring French maid, she would close
her eyes and dream that the fairy-stories which the patient
Jos&egrave; had told her again and again in her distant home town
had come true, and that she had been transformed into a
beautiful princess, who would some day go in search of the
sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.</p>
<p>Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy
of Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page71' name='book3_page71'></a>71</span>
monetary contributions&ndash;&ndash;and of her unanswered letters&ndash;&ndash;of
the war devastating her native land&ndash;&ndash;of rudely severed ties,
and unimaginable changes&ndash;&ndash;and she would start from her
musing and brush away the gathering tears, and try to realize
that her present situation and environment were but means
to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do
His work, with no thought of herself.</p>
<p>A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new
home, during which she had left the house only for her diurnal
ride in the big limousine, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles announced her
readiness to fire the first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien.
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said to her sister, as they sat alone in the
luxurious sun-parlor, &ldquo;my washerwoman dropped a remark
the other day which gave me something to build on. Her two
babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street. Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien&rsquo;s
sole charity&ndash;&ndash;in fact, it is her particular hobby. I presume
that she feels she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the
time is not far distant when she will have to close up her
earthly accounts and hand them over to the heavenly auditor.
Anyway, this last year or two she has suddenly become philanthropic,
and when the General Orphan Asylum was building she
gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her name.
What&rsquo;s more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without
the wink of an eyelash. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the point: some rich old fellow has willed the
institution a fund whose income every year is used to buy
clothing for the kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration
on the day the duds are given out, and the public is invited to
inspect the place and the inmates, and eat a bit, and look
around generally. Well, my washerwoman tells me that the
Beaubien always attends these annual celebrations. The next
one, I learn, comes in about a month. I propose that we attend;
take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the children,
and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien, who
will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her. The rest is easy. I&rsquo;ll
have a word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to
her for saving Jim&rsquo;s fortune years ago when he was entangled
in her net&ndash;&ndash;and, well, if that scheme doesn&rsquo;t work, I have
other strings to my bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most
sanguine hopes of its projector. On the day that the General
Orphan Asylum threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles
limousine rubbed noses with the big French car of the
Beaubien in the street without; while within the building the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page72' name='book3_page72'></a>72</span>
Beaubien held the hand of the beautiful girl whose voluntary
singing had spread a veil of silence over the awed spectators
in the great assembly room, and, looking earnestly down into
the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: &ldquo;My dear child, I want to
know you.&rdquo; Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
&ldquo;I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon,
with your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her permission! Heavens! Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
wildly hugged her sister and the girl all the way home&ndash;&ndash;then
went to bed that night with tears of apprehension in her
washed-out eyes, lest she had shown herself too eager in granting
the Beaubien&rsquo;s request. But her fears were turned to exultation
when the Beaubien car drew up at her door the following
day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur announced
his errand. A few moments later, while the car glided purring
over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the
dead little town so far away.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_9_1_1' id='CHAPTER_9_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sing it again, dear. I know you are tired, but I want to
hear that song just once more. Somehow it seems to
bring up thoughts of&ndash;&ndash;of things that might have been.&rdquo;
The Beaubien&rsquo;s voice sank to a whisper as she finished.</p>
<p>Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird
lament which had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges
a few days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know why that song affects me so,&rdquo; mused the
Beaubien, when the girl had finished and returned to the seat
beside her. Then, abruptly: &ldquo;I wish you could play the pipe-organ
out in the hall. I put twelve thousand dollars into it,
and I can&rsquo;t even play five-finger exercises on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve thousand dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen, drawing a
long breath, while her eyes dilated.</p>
<p>The woman laughed. &ldquo;Would that buy your beloved
Simit&iacute;?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose
we just go down there and buy the whole town. It would
at least give me an interest in life. Do you think I could stand
the heat there? But tell me more about it. How did you live,
and what did you do? And who is this Jos&egrave;? And are you
really descended from the old Incas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page73' name='book3_page73'></a>73</span>
At one end of the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled
in the huge fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early
spring day and casting a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls
and polished floor in front, where dozed the Beaubien&rsquo;s two
&ldquo;babies,&rdquo; Japanese and Pekingese spaniels of registered pedigree
and fabulous value. Among the heavy beams of the lofty
ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered, while over the
costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued lights
played in animated pantomime. Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance
into the room. Everything in the woman&rsquo;s environment was
softened into the same degree of voluptuousness which characterized
her and the life of sybaritic ease which she affected.</p>
<p>From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been
charmed, fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless
wealth and the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious
manifestation. The Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her
the epitome of material elegance and comfort, far exceeding the
most fantastic concepts of her childish imagination, when she
had listened enraptured to Padre Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s compelling stories of
the great world beyond Simit&iacute;. But the gorgeous web of this
social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles mansion suffer in
comparison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could
no longer restrain her wonder and admiration, &ldquo;this is but a
shed beside the new Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.
I presume he will put not less than ten millions into it before it
is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten millions! In just a house!&rdquo; Carmen dared not attempt
to grasp the complex significance of such an expenditure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is that such a huge amount, child?&rdquo; asked the Beaubien,
as accustomed to think in eight figures as in two. &ldquo;But,
I forget that you are from the jungle. Yet, who would imagine
it?&rdquo; she mused, gazing with undisguised admiration at the
beautiful, animated girl before her.</p>
<p>Silence then fell upon them both. Carmen was struggling
with the deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened
her eyes upon her as if she would have them bore deep into
the soul of whose rarity she was becoming slowly aware. What
thoughts coursed through the mind of the Beaubien as she sat
studying the girl through the tempered light, we may not
know. What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told. Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this
creature of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl&rsquo;s great
innocence and purity of thought, her righteousness? Or did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page74' name='book3_page74'></a>74</span>
she see in her something that she herself might once have
been&ndash;&ndash;something that all her gold, and all the wealth of Ormus
or of Ind could never buy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got,&rdquo; she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed,
&ldquo;that I haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; And then the banality of the question
struck her, and she laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon
the woman, &ldquo;you have everything! Oh, what more could you
wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; returned the woman quickly, though she knew not
why she said it. And yet, memory was busy uncovering those
bitter days when, in the first agony of marital disappointment,
she had, with hot, streaming tears, implored heaven to give her
a child. But the gift had been denied; and her heart had
shrunk and grown heavily calloused.</p>
<p>Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice
which stirred the girl&rsquo;s quick sympathy. &ldquo;Yes, you have
youth, and beauty. They are mine no longer. But I could
part with them, gladly, if only there were anything left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her. Forgetful
of caste, decorum, convention, everything but the boundless
love which she felt for all mankind, she put her arms about
the worldly woman&rsquo;s neck and kissed her.</p>
<p>For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise. It
was the only manifestation of selfless love that had ever come
into her sordid experience. Was it possible that this was
spontaneous? that it was an act of real sympathy, and not a
clever ruse to win her from behind the mask of affection?
Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for favors.
Alas! they drew not many now, although time was when
a single one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.</p>
<p>The girl herself quickly met the woman&rsquo;s groping thought.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the world to show what love will do,&rdquo; she murmured;
&ldquo;and I love you.&rdquo; Had she not thus solved every problem from
earliest childhood?</p>
<p>The Beaubien melted. Not even a heart of stone could
withstand the solvent power of such love. Her head dropped
upon her breast, and she wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered
cheek. &ldquo;Why, we are all God&rsquo;s children; we all have
one another; you have me, and I have you; and God means
us all to be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien looked up, wondering. Her variegated life
included no such tender experience as this. She had long since
ceased to shed aught but tears of anger. But now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page75' name='book3_page75'></a>75</span>
gently motioned her back to her chair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; she
smiled, with swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of anything that would help me as much as a
good cry. If I could have had a daughter like you, I should&ndash;&ndash;but
never mind now.&rdquo; She tried to laugh, as she wiped
her eyes.</p>
<p>Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and
she became suddenly animated. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;listen,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to learn the pipe-organ? Will you come here
and take lessons? I will pay for them; I will engage the best
teacher in New York; and you shall take two or three a week,
and use the big organ out in the hall. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s heart gave a great leap. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
her eyes dancing. &ldquo;But I must ask Mrs. Reed, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it myself,&rdquo; returned the woman with growing enthusiasm.
&ldquo;William,&rdquo; she directed, when the butler responded
to her summons, &ldquo;get Mrs. Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.
But who is coming, I wonder?&rdquo; glancing through the window
at an automobile that had drawn up at her door. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; a
look of vexation mantling her face, &ldquo;the Right Reverend Monsignor
Lafelle. Well,&rdquo; turning to Carmen, &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
to send you home now, dear. But tell Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall
speak to her at that time about your music lessons. William,
take Monsignor into the morning room, and then tell Henri to
bring the car to the porte-coch&egrave;re for Miss Carmen. Good-bye,
dear,&rdquo; kissing the bright, upturned face of the waiting girl.
&ldquo;I wish I could&ndash;&ndash;but, well, don&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;m coming for you
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon Mrs. Hawley-Crowles directed her French
tailor to cable to Paris for advance styles. Twenty-four hours
later she hastened with outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien,
waiting in the reception room. Oh, yes, they had heard
often of each other; and now were so pleased to meet! New
York was such a whirlpool, and it was so difficult to form
desirable friendships. Yes, the Beaubien had known the late-lamented
Hawley-Crowles; but, dear! dear! that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both
young and foolish. And&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and
me to be mutually helpful at a time when I was in sore need of
a friend; and the debt of gratitude is not yours to me, but mine
to your kind husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.
What cared she that her husband&rsquo;s always unsavory name
had been linked with this woman&rsquo;s? She had married the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page76' name='book3_page76'></a>76</span>
roistering blade for his bank account only. Any other male
whose wealth ran into seven figures would have done as well,
or better.</p>
<p>And Carmen? Bless you, no! To be sure, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
gratefully accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien
mansion for the girl; but she herself insisted upon bearing
the expense of the lessons. Carmen had wonderful musical
talent. Together, she and the Beaubien, they would foster and
develop it. Moreover, though of course this must follow later,
she intended to give the girl every social advantage befitting
her beauty, her talents, and her station.</p>
<p>And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just
how long to stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles turned to her sister with her face flushed with
anger. &ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; she exclaimed, while hot tears
suffused her eyes. &ldquo;The hussy went away actually laughing
at me! What do you suppose she&rsquo;s got up her sleeve? But,
let me tell you, she&rsquo;ll not fool me! I&rsquo;ll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I&rsquo;ve done that, I&rsquo;ll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor
old Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow
across the full splendor of Carmen&rsquo;s happiness, the silence that
shrouded Simit&iacute;. But Harris was preparing to return to Colombia,
and his trip promised a solution of the mystery of her
unanswered letters. For weeks Carmen had struggled to teach
him Spanish, with but small measure of success. The gift of
tongues was not his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter,&rdquo; he said one day, when they were alone in
the Hawley-Crowles parlor. Then a curious light came into
his eyes, and he blurted, &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though
she knew not from what depths it had sprung. Harris shrugged
his broad shoulders and sighed. He had not a hundred dollars
to his name.</p>
<p>Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest
he shared with Reed in La Libertad. For, despite the disturbed
state of affairs in Colombia, Simit&iacute; stock had sold rapidly,
under the sedulous care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a
sufficient fund had been accumulated to warrant the inauguration
of development work on the mine. A few years hence
Harris should be rich from that source alone.</p>
<p>Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature
which Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting
engineer to the Simit&iacute; Development Company. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page77' name='book3_page77'></a>77</span>
wife had continued her temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles
mansion, while awaiting with what fortitude she could
command the passing of her still vigorous father, and the results
of her defiant sister&rsquo;s assaults upon the Ames set.</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s days were crowded full. The wonderful organ in
the Beaubien mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over
her soul, and daily she sat before it, uncovering new marvels
and losing herself deeper and deeper in its infinite mysteries.
Her progress was commensurate with her consecration, and
brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips of her now
devoted Beaubien. Hour after hour the latter would sit in the
twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried
for long, meaningless years. They now talked but little, this
strange woman and the equally strange girl. Their communion
was no longer of the lips. It was the silent yearning of a dry,
desolate heart, striving to open itself to the love which the
girl was sending far and wide in the quenchless hope that it
might meet just such a need. For Carmen dwelt in the spirit,
and she instinctively accepted her splendid material environment
as the gift, not of man, but of the great divine Mind, which
had led her into this new world that she might be a channel
for the expression of its love to the erring children of mortals.</p>
<p>She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence
as if the house belonged to her. At first the Beaubien
smiled indulgently. And then her smile became a laugh of
eager joy as she daily greeted her radiant visitor, whose entrance
into the great, dark house was always followed by a flood
of sunshine, and whose departure marked the setting in of
night to the heart-hungry woman. In the first days of their
association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled
her evenings and sat about her board. But as days melted into
weeks, she became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the
transition; and the hour at length arrived when she fully
realized that she was facing the most momentous decision that
had ever been evolved by her worldly mode of living. But that
was a matter of slow development through many months.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds. A week
after Carmen began the study of the organ she boldly ventured
to accompany her one day to the Beaubien citadel. She was
graciously received, and departed with the Beaubien&rsquo;s promise
to return the call. Thereupon she set about revising her own
social list, and dropped several names which she now felt
could serve her no longer. Her week-end at Newport, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page78' name='book3_page78'></a>78</span>
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of
the gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully
upon its summer <i>siesta</i>. Even the theaters and concert halls
were closed, and the metropolis was nodding its weary head
dully and sinking into somnolence. It was exactly what Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles desired. The summer interim would give her
time to further her plans and prepare the girl for her social
<i>d&eacute;but</i> in the early winter. &ldquo;And Milady Ames will be mentioned
in the papers next day as assisting at the function&ndash;&ndash;the
cat!&rdquo; she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her revised list
of social desirables.</p>
<p>But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent
entry into polite society Mrs. Hawley-Crowles soon realized that
she had assumed a task of generous proportions. In the first
place, despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a
proper sense of money values. Her eyes were ever gaping in
astonishment at what Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her sister
regarded as the most moderate of expenditures, and it was
only when the Beaubien herself mildly hinted to them that
ingenuousness was one of the girl&rsquo;s greatest social assets, that
they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder, even while inwardly
pitying her dense ignorance and lack of sophistication.</p>
<p>A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate
sense of honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed
to wreck their standing with the fashionable Mrs. Gannette of
Riverside Drive, a pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented
dame, anaemic of mind, but tremendously aristocratic, and of
scarcely inferior social dignity to that of the envied Mrs. Ames.
For, when Mrs. Gannette moved into the neighborhood where
dwelt the ambitious Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, the latter was taken
by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was immediately
received into the worldly old lady&rsquo;s good graces. And
it so happened that, after the gay season had closed that
summer, Mrs. Gannette invited Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her
sister to an informal afternoon of bridge, and especially requested
that they bring their young ward, whose beauty and
wonderful story were, through the discreet maneuvers of her
guardians, beginning to be talked about. For some weeks previously
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen into
the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for
the girl&rsquo;s thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged. On this
particular afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the
gorgeous dress, the lavish display of jewelry, and the general
inanity of conversation; and her score was pitiably low. The
following morning, to her great astonishment, she received a
bill from the practical Mrs. Gannette for ten dollars to cover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page79' name='book3_page79'></a>79</span>
her losses at the game. For a long time the bewildered girl
mused over it. Then she called the chauffeur and despatched
him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay
for the refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a
polite little note of explanation.</p>
<p>The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt
from the Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion,
was given to understand by the irate Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
that her conduct was as reprehensible as if she had attacked
the eminent Mrs. Gannette with an axe. Whereupon the sorrowing
Carmen packed her effects and prepared to depart from
the presence of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified consternation
of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before the
girl and the offended Mrs. Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded
in restoring peace.</p>
<p>When the Beaubien, who had become the girl&rsquo;s confidante,
learned the story, she laughed till her sides ached. And then
her lips set, and her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered,
&ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; But she smiled again as she gathered the penitent
girl in her arms, and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through
with New York. And,&rdquo; she added, her brow again clouding,
&ldquo;you <i>will</i> be through with it&ndash;&ndash;some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette,
who happened to be present, swore between roars of
laughter that he would use it as a club over his wife, should she
ever again trap him in any of his numerous indiscretions.</p>
<p>Again, the girl&rsquo;s odd views of life and its meaning which,
despite her efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now
and then, caused the worldly Mrs. Hawley-Crowles much consternation.
Carmen tried desperately to be discreet. Even
Harris advised her to listen much, but say little; and she strove
hard to obey. But she would forget and hurl the newspapers
from her with exclamations of horror over their red-inked
depictions of mortal frailty&ndash;&ndash;she would flatly refuse to discuss
crime or disease&ndash;&ndash;and she would comment disparagingly
at too frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and
the emptiness of the peacock-life which she saw manifested
about her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she would say, when
she was alone with the Beaubien. &ldquo;Why, with the wonderful
opportunities which you rich people have, how can you&ndash;&ndash;oh,
how can you toss them aside for the frivolities and littleness
that you all seem to be striving for! It seems to me you must
be mad&ndash;&ndash;<i>loco</i>! And I know you are, for you are simply mesmerized!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page80' name='book3_page80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in
her arms. &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she would often say, &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;
But she would offer no further comment.</p>
<p>Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen
ever looking and listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the
new world into which she had been cast. In a sense her existence
was as narrowly routined as ever it had been in Simit&iacute;,
for her days were spent at the great organ, with frequent rides
in the automobile through the parks and boulevards for variation;
and her evenings were jealously guarded by Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion until
the advent of her formal introduction to the world of fashionable
society, when her associates would be selected only from the
narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone
she might mingle. To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances
now might prove fatal to the scheming woman&rsquo;s
cherished plans, and was a risk that could not be entertained.
And Carmen, suppressing her wonder, and striving incessantly
to curb her ready tongue, accepted her environment as the
unreal expression of the human mind, and submitted&ndash;&ndash;and
waited.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
</div>
<p>The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen
North, and summer had gathered her dainty robes about
her and fled shivering before them. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
stood at a window and gazed with unseeing eyes at the withered
leaves tossing in the wind.</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the
gay season was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her
which she had set for the girl&rsquo;s formal <i>d&eacute;but</i>. Already, through
informal calls and gatherings, she had made her charming and
submissive ward known to most of her own city acquaintances
and the members of her particular set. The fresh, beautiful
girl&rsquo;s winning personality; her frank, ingenuous manner; her
evident sincerity and her na&iuml;ve remarks, which now only gave
hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide to her,
and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody&rsquo;s tongue. There remained now only the
part which the woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which,
thus far, she had found neither the courage nor the opportunity
to suggest to that influential woman. Gazing out into
the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot in sheer vexation.
The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been politely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page81' name='book3_page81'></a>81</span>
affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the summer;
and had said nothing. But what was there for her to
say? The hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles could have wept with chagrin as she reflected
gloomily on her own timorous spirit.</p>
<p>But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague
idea flitted into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.
Carmen had spoken of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor
Lafelle at the Beaubien mansion, although the girl had never
met him. Now why did he go there? &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles. &ldquo;Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a French
Catholic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what had that to do with Carmen? Nothing&ndash;&ndash;except&ndash;&ndash;why,
to be sure, the girl came from a Catholic country, and
therefore was a Catholic! Mrs. Hawley-Crowles chuckled.
That was worth developing a little further. &ldquo;Let us see,&rdquo; she
reflected, &ldquo;Kathleen Ames is coming out this winter, too. Just
about Carmen&rsquo;s age. Candidate for her mother&rsquo;s social position,
of course. Now the Ames family are all Presbyterians. The
Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that
will keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked
them early in the game. Now suppose&ndash;&ndash;suppose Lafelle should
tell the Beaubien that&ndash;&ndash;that there&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;no, that won&rsquo;t do! But
suppose I tell him that here&rsquo;s a chance for him to back a Catholic
against a Protestant for the highest social honors in New
York&ndash;&ndash;Carmen versus Kathleen&ndash;&ndash;what would he say? Humph!
I&rsquo;m just as good a Catholic as Protestant. Jim was Irish&ndash;&ndash;clear
through. And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell Baptist,
as suited his needs. He played &rsquo;em all. Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I&rsquo;m smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my
late, unlamented consort&ndash;&ndash;what then? It&rsquo;s worth considering,
anyway. Yes, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it was that a few days later Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
timed it so carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien
with Carmen shortly after Monsignor Lafelle&rsquo;s car had pulled
up at the same door. It was the merest accident, too, that
Carmen led her puffing guardian directly into the morning
room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor in earnest conversation.
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles would have retired at once,
stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another&rsquo;s house; but the Beaubien was
grace and cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her
three callers and making them mutually acquainted.</p>
<p>With the ice thus broken, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles found it
easy to take the contemplated plunge. Therefore she smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page82' name='book3_page82'></a>82</span>
triumphantly when, a week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted
at her own door, in response to a summons on matters pertaining
to the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Madam,&rdquo; replied the holy man, after carefully listening
to her announcement, &ldquo;I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.
I am not connected with this diocese. I am traveling almost
constantly. But I shall be most pleased to lay it before
him, with my endorsement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, Monsignor,&rdquo; sweetly responded the gracious
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. &ldquo;I sought your advice because I had
met you through my dear friend, Madam Beaubien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of
service to you, Madam,&rdquo; said Monsignor, rising to depart.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added with a tender smile, &ldquo;a pleasure that would
be enhanced were you to become one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come.
&ldquo;A moment, please, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said, her heart beating
quickly. &ldquo;There is another matter. Please be seated. It concerns
my ward, the young girl whom you met at Madam Beaubien&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; said the man, resuming his seat. &ldquo;A beautiful
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Hawley-Crowles enthusiastically.
&ldquo;And just budding into still more beautiful womanhood.&rdquo; She
stopped and reflected a moment. Then she threw herself precipitately
into her topic, as if she feared further delay would
result in the evaporation of her boldness. &ldquo;Monsignor, it is, as
you say, unfortunate that I profess no religious convictions;
and yet, as I have told you, I find that as the years pass I lean
ever more strongly toward your Church. Now you will pardon
me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed intention to make
America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this country
to work toward that end&ndash;&ndash;is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did
not reply. The woman went on without waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if
you disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the
matter was ever under discussion. To begin with, I heartily
endorse your missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.
Nothing but the strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems
to me, can check our headlong plunge into ruin. But, Monsignor,
you do not always work where your labors are most
needed. You may control political&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; interrupted the man, holding up a hand
and shaking his head in gentle demurral, &ldquo;the Catholic Church
is not in politics.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page83' name='book3_page83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it is in society&ndash;&ndash;or should be!&rdquo; said the woman earnestly.
&ldquo;And if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in
America it must work from the top down, as well as from the
lower levels upward. At present our wealthiest, most influential
social set is absolutely domineered by a Protestant&ndash;&ndash;and
under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at that! Why
do you permit it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor Lafelle&rsquo;s eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.
But he only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely
head, and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles, &ldquo;why do not the women of your Church constitute
our society leaders? Why do you not recognize the desirability
of forcing your people into every avenue of human
activity? And would you resent a suggestion from me as to
how in one instance this might be accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Madam,&rdquo; replied Monsignor, with an expression
of wonder on his face. &ldquo;Pray proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are laughing at me, I do believe!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
catching the glint in his gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested. Please
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation
if you do not approve of it,&rdquo; she said quizzically.</p>
<p>He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, now to the point. My ward, the little Inca
princess, is coming out shortly. I want her to have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
into the very best society, into the most fashionable and exclusive
set, as befitting her rank.&rdquo; She stopped and awaited
the effect of her words.</p>
<p>Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into
a genial laugh. &ldquo;There is nothing reprehensible in your wish,
Madam,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our social system, however imperfect,
nevertheless exists, and&ndash;&ndash;dominant Catholic influence might
improve it. I am quite sure it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. &ldquo;Then will you
help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I really see nothing that I can do,&rdquo; he replied slowly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his
apparent dullness. &ldquo;You can do much,&rdquo; she retorted in a tone
tinctured with impatience. &ldquo;Since I have made you my Father
Confessor to-day, I am going to tell you that I intend to start a
social war that will rip this city wide open. It is going to be
war in which Catholic is pitted against Protestant. Now, which
side is your Church on?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page84' name='book3_page84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he
stared at her uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his
poise and replied calmly, &ldquo;Neither, Madam; it remains quite
neutral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me if I say it; not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured, her eagerness subsiding. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ve
made an awful mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he amended gently, &ldquo;you have made a good friend.
And, as such, I again urge you first to respect the leaning
which you mentioned a moment ago and become actively affiliated
with our Church here in New York. Both you and the
young lady. Will you not consider it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will consider it,&rdquo; she responded, brightening
with hope. &ldquo;And I will go so far as to say that I have long had
it in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss
the less important matter of your ward&rsquo;s entrance into society&ndash;&ndash;is
it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited. &ldquo;But
the girl, Monsignor, is already a Catholic&ndash;&ndash;comes from a Catholic
country. It is she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will efface yourself?&rdquo; he queried with a peculiar
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are cruel,&rdquo; she retorted, affecting an air of injured
innocence as she stood before him with downcast eyes. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;if
you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Monsignor, &ldquo;plainly, what is it that you
wish me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally
sudden but less thoughtful response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the Beau&ndash;&ndash;Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward
to be received into the best society, and for the reasons I have
given you. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with
the members of fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?&rdquo;
he asked, an odd look coming into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his
wife will receive us both,&rdquo; said the woman, carried away by
her eagerness. &ldquo;And that means strong Catholic influence in
New York&rsquo;s most aristocratic set!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; continued the woman eagerly, &ldquo;will your
Church receive an altar from me in memory of my late husband?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page85' name='book3_page85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>He reflected a moment. Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest
tone, &ldquo;It would receive such a gift from one of the faith. When
may we expect you to become a communicant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled. She had
wondered how far she might go with this clever churchman,
and now she knew that she had gone too far. But to retract&ndash;&ndash;to
have him relate this conversation and her retraction to the
Beaubien&ndash;&ndash;were fatal! She had set her trap&ndash;&ndash;and walked into
it. She groped blindly for an answer. Then, raising her eyes
and meeting his searching glance, she murmured feebly,
&ldquo;Whenever you say, Monsignor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man had departed, which he did immediately,
the plotting woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept
with rage. &ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; she wailed, as her wondering sister entered
the room, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to join the Catholic Church! But I&rsquo;d go
through Sheol to beat that Ames outfit!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>
</div>
<p>MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on
the Beaubien a few days later. That lady, fresh
from her bath, scented, powdered, and charming in a
loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said,
waving him to a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up
the two spaniels. &ldquo;I have a dinner to-night, and so shall not
listen unless you have something fresh and really worth while
to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Madam,&rdquo; said he, bowing low before he sank into
the great leather armchair, &ldquo;you are charming, and the Church
is justly proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, my friend,&rdquo; she returned, knitting her brows.
&ldquo;That may be fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to. And
if you persist in that vein I shall be obliged to have William set
you into the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam,&rdquo; he
replied, as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure.
&ldquo;The Church has never ceased to claim you, however far you
may have wandered from her. But I will be brief. I am leaving
for Canada shortly on a mission of some importance. May
I not take with me the consoling assurance that you have at
last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother, who
has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page86' name='book3_page86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>The Beaubien smiled indulgently. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said gently,
&ldquo;I thought that was it. No, Monsignor, no,&rdquo; shaking her head.
&ldquo;When only a wild, thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order
that I might marry Gaspard de Beaubien. The priest urged;
and I&ndash;&ndash;poof! what cared I? But the past eighteen years have
confirmed me in some views; and one is that I shall gain nothing,
either here or hereafter, by renewing my allegiance to the
Church of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair.
Yet his sigh bore a hope. &ldquo;I learned this morning,&rdquo; he said
musingly, &ldquo;that my recent labors with the Dowager Duchess
of Altern in England have not been vain. She has become a
communicant of Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Beaubien. &ldquo;The Duchess of Altern&ndash;&ndash;sister
of Mrs. J. Wilton Ames? Why, she was a high Anglican&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a degree below the true Church, Madam. Her action
is but anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican
Church to the true fold. And I learn further,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;that the Duchess will spend the winter in New York with her
sister. Which means, of course, an unusually gay season here,
does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment.
&ldquo;Well, Monsignor,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;for once you really are interesting.
What else have you to divulge? That Mrs. Ames
herself will be the next convert? Or perhaps J. Wilton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;at least, not yet. But one of your most intimate
friends will become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my most intimate friends!&rdquo; The Beaubien set the
spaniels down on the floor. &ldquo;Now, my dear Monsignor, you are
positively refreshing. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed softly. &ldquo;Am I not right when I insist that
you have wandered far, dear Madam? It is not &lsquo;he,&rsquo; but &lsquo;she,&rsquo;
your dear friend, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien&rsquo;s mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly
upright and gazed blankly at her raconteur. The man went on,
apparently oblivious of the effect his information had produced.
&ldquo;Her beautiful ward, who is to make her bow to society
this winter, is one of us by birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have been at work on Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and
her ward, have you?&rdquo; said the Beaubien severely, and there was
a threatening note in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; returned Monsignor easily, &ldquo;the lady sent for me
to express her desire to become affiliated with the Church. We
do not seek her. And I have had no conversation with the
girl, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page87' name='book3_page87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>The Beaubien reflected. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
takes this unusual step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unusual! Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has
seen much of the world to turn from it to the solace and promise
of the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien laughed sharply. &ldquo;For women like Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles it is, decidedly. What was her price, Monsignor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam! You astonish me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor, I do not. I know Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. And
by this time you do, too. She is the last woman in the world
to turn from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously
upon both the Church and me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;
she commanded imperiously, as he rose. &ldquo;I have a few things
to say to you, since this is to be your last call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, not the last, I hope. For I shall not cease to plead
the cause of the Church to you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Monsignor, that is your business. You are welcome
in my house at any time, and particularly when you have such
delightful scraps of gossip as these which you have brought
to-day. But, a word before you go, lest you become indiscreet
on your return. Play Mrs. Hawley-Crowles to any extent you
wish, but let her ward alone&ndash;&ndash;<i>absolutely</i>! She is not for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no
doubt in the man&rsquo;s mind of her meaning. She was not trifling
with him now, he knew. In her low-voiced words he found no
trace of banter, of sophistry, nor of aught that he might in any
wise misinterpret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as
you may possibly know. Will you admit that I can do much
for or against you? Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me
frankly just what has induced Mrs. Hawley-Crowles to unite
with your Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man knew he was pitting his own against a master
mind. He hesitated and weighed well his words before replying.
&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he at length, with a note of reproach, &ldquo;you
misjudge the lady, the Church, and me, its humble servant.
The latter require no defense. As for Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, I
speak truly when I say that doubtless she has been greatly influenced
by love for her late husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; The Beaubien half rose from her chair. &ldquo;Jim
Crowles&ndash;&ndash;that raw, Irish boob, who was holding down a job on
the police force until Ames found he could make a convenient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page88' name='book3_page88'></a>88</span>
tool of him! The man who was Gannette&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s-paw in the Fall
River franchise steal! Now, Monsignor, would you have me
believe you devoid of all sense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and
for the moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched
use of his facts, &ldquo;she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a
memorial to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; The Beaubien sank back limp.</p>
<p>Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise. He felt that he
was guilty of a miserable <i>faux pas</i>. &ldquo;Madam, I regret that I
must be leaving. But the hour&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Monsignor!&rdquo; The Beaubien roused up and laid a
detaining hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Our versatile friend, what
other projects has she in hand? What is she planning for her
young ward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, really, I can not say&ndash;&ndash;beyond the fact that the girl
is to be introduced to society this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Going to make a try for the Ames set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?&rdquo; demanded
the woman, leaning forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I
say that she intimated as much,&rdquo; he said, watching her closely
and sparring now with better judgment. &ldquo;She mentioned Mrs.
Ames as New York&rsquo;s fashionable society leader&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such position as leader in New York society,
Monsignor,&rdquo; interrupted the Beaubien coldly. &ldquo;There are sets
and cliques, and Mrs. Ames happens to be prominent in the
one which at present foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper
stratum. Rot! And Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but
a tarnished name and a large bank account to recommend her,
now wishes to break into that clique and attain social leadership,
does she? How decidedly interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and grew hard. Leaning
closer to the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his
knee. &ldquo;So, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said, with cold precision, &ldquo;this is
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&rsquo;s method of renouncing the world, is it?
Sublime! And she would use both you and me, eh? And you
are her ambassador at the court of the Beaubien? Very well,
then, she shall use us. But you and I will first make this compact,
my dear Monsignor: Mrs. Hawley-Crowles shall be taken
into the so-called &lsquo;Ames set,&rsquo; and you shall cease importuning
me to return to your Church, and what is more, shall promise to
have no conversation on church matters with her ward, the
young girl. If you do not agree to this, Monsignor, I shall set in
motion forces that will make your return to New York quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page89' name='book3_page89'></a>89</span>
undesirable.&rdquo; When she concluded, she looked long and
steadily into his eyes.</p>
<p>Monsignor got slowly to his feet. &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; he exclaimed
in a hoarse whisper, &ldquo;my astonishment&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand,
&ldquo;please omit the dramatics, Monsignor. And now you must go,
for to-night I entertain, and I have already given you more
time than I intended. But, Monsignor, do you in future work
with or against me? Are we to be friends or enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Madam,&rdquo; he replied quickly, &ldquo;we could never be the
latter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially
if she is a lady, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, Madam,&rdquo; he returned after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
as he bowed low over her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, good-bye. And, Monsignor,&rdquo; she added, when he
reached the door, &ldquo;I shall be pleased to attend the dedication
of the Hawley-Crowles altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Monsignor&rsquo;s car glided away from her door the Beaubien&rsquo;s
face grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits. &ldquo;So,&rdquo;
she reflected, as she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing
room, &ldquo;that is her game, is it? The poor, fat simpleton has
no interest in either the girl or myself, other than to use us as
stepping-stones. She forgets that a stone sometimes turns
under the foot. Fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She entered her room and rang for her maid. Turning to
the pier glass, she threw on the electric light and scrutinized
her features narrowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;fast!
God, how I hate those gray hairs! Oh, what a farce life is&ndash;&ndash;what
a howling, mocking farce! I hate it! I hate everything&ndash;&ndash;everybody!
No&ndash;&ndash;that little girl&ndash;&ndash;if it is possible for me to love,
I love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank into an easy chair. &ldquo;I wonder what it is she does
to me. I&rsquo;m hypnotized, I guess. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m different when
I&rsquo;m with her. And to think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice
the child&ndash;&ndash;humph! But, if the girl is made of the right
stuff&ndash;&ndash;and I know she is&ndash;&ndash;she will stand up under it and be
stronger for the experience. She has got something that will
make her stand! I once asked her what she had that I didn&rsquo;t,
and now I know&ndash;&ndash;it is her religion, the religion that Borwell
and Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would
corrupt if they had half a chance! Very well, we&rsquo;ll see what it
does under the test. If it saves her, then I want it myself. But,
as for that little pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she&rsquo;s already
signed her own death-warrant. She shall get into the Ames
set, yes. And I will use her, oh, beautifully! to pay off certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page90' name='book3_page90'></a>90</span>
old scores against Madam Ames&ndash;&ndash;and then I&rsquo;ll crush her like a
dried leaf, the fat fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien&rsquo;s position was, to say the least, peculiar, and
one which required infinite tact on her part to protect. It was
for that reason that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners
was so rigidly observed, and that, whatever the moral
status of the man who sat at her board, his conduct was required
to be above reproach, on penalty of immediate ejection
from the circle of financial pirates, captains of commercial
jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts opportunities
for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.</p>
<p>It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly
gowned Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had
gathered almost nightly for years to rig the market, determine
the price of wheat or cotton, and develop mendacious schemes
of stock-jobbery whose golden harvests they could calculate
almost to a dollar before launching. As the wealth of this
clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all bounds, so
increased their power, until at last it could be justly said that,
when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the Beaubien
practically controlled Wall Street&ndash;&ndash;and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself. But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued
to pay homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful
intellect.</p>
<p>At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith,
and she could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest,
most aristocratic society dame, or force the door of the most
exclusive set for any prot&eacute;g&eacute;e who might have been kept long
years knocking in vain, or whose family name, perchance,
headed a list of indictments for gross peculations. At these
unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark, mahogany-wainscoted
dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a single
lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon
the sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely
guarded room shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid
and decrees adopted which seated judges, silenced clergymen,
elected senators, and influenced presidents. There a muck-raking,
hostile press was muffled. There business opposition
was crushed and competition throttled. There tax rates were
determined and tariff schedules formulated. There public
opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the death-warrant
of every threatening reformer drawn and signed. In
a word, there Mammon, in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page91' name='book3_page91'></a>91</span>
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of
human endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.
These wires were gathered together into the hands of one man,
the directing genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames. Over him
lay the shadow of the Beaubien.</p>
<p>An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien,
like a radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her
assembled guests. Some moments later the heavy doors of
the great dining room swung noiselessly open, and the lady
proceeded unescorted to her position at the head of the table.
At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and the butler
immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course. The chair at the far end of the
table, opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ames is late to-night,&rdquo; observed the girthy Gannette,
glancing toward the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to
tuck his napkin into his collar.</p>
<p>The Beaubien looked sharply at him. &ldquo;Were you at the
club this afternoon, Mr. Gannette?&rdquo; she inquired coldly.</p>
<p>Gannette straightened up and became rigid. Pulling the
napkin down hastily, he replied in a thick voice, &ldquo;Just a little
game of bridge&ndash;&ndash;some old friends&ndash;&ndash;back from Europe&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien turned to the butler. &ldquo;William, Mr. Gannette
is not drinking wine this evening.&rdquo; The butler bowed and removed
the glasses from that gentleman&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Gannette turned to expostulate. &ldquo;Now, Lucile&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began
peevishly. The Beaubien held up a hand. Gannette glowered
and sank down in his chair like a swollen toad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors&rsquo;
meeting,&rdquo; suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides. A general laugh followed
the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; said Fitch, &ldquo;that for once Ames has been
outwitted, and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and
the most mettlesome speculator of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; explained Weston, &ldquo;some months ago Ames tried
to reach Ed. Stolz through Ketchim, the old man&rsquo;s nephew,
and get control of C. and R. But friend nephew dropped the
portcullis just as Ames was dashing across the drawbridge, and
J. Wilton found himself outside, looking through the bars.
First time I&rsquo;ve ever known that to happen. Now the boys have
got hold of it on &lsquo;Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long time leaking out, seems to me,&rdquo; remarked Kane.
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s Ames going to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page92' name='book3_page92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess,&rdquo; returned Weston. &ldquo;He seems to have
dropped the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will find yourself mistaken,&rdquo; put in the Beaubien
evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.
&ldquo;Have you inside information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But Mr. Ames always gets
what he goes after, and he will secure control of C. and R.
eventually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; vigorously asserted Murdock, who had
been an interested listener. &ldquo;He will never oust Stolz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one thousand dollars that says he will,&rdquo; said the
Beaubien, calmly regarding the speaker. &ldquo;William, my checkbook,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no
time recovering his poise. Drawing out his own book he
wrote a check in the Beaubien&rsquo;s name for the amount and
sent it down the table to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fitch will hold the stakes,&rdquo; said the woman, handing
him the two slips of paper. &ldquo;And we will set a time limit of
eighteen months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked Peele, the only one of the group
who had taken no part in the preceding conversation, &ldquo;I see by
the evening paper that there&rsquo;s been another accident in the
Avon mills. Fellow named Marcus caught in a machine and
crushed all out of shape. That&rsquo;s the third one down there
this month. They&rsquo;ll force Ames to equip his mills with safety
devices if this keeps up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the
Legislature,&rdquo; returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added more seriously, &ldquo;that is not where the danger
lies. The real source of apprehension is in the possibility of
a strike. And if war breaks out among those Hungarians
down there it will cost him more than to equip all his
mills now with safety devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up.
&ldquo;Speaking of war,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;has Ames, or any of you
fellows, got a finger in the muddle in South America? I&rsquo;ve got
interests down there&ndash;&ndash;concessions and the like&ndash;&ndash;and by&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;
He wandered off into incoherent mutterings.</p>
<p>The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler. &ldquo;William,
Mr. Gannette is leaving now. You will escort him to
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Lucile!&rdquo; cried Gannette, his apoplectic
face becoming more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering
angrily upon the calm woman. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to stand this!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page93' name='book3_page93'></a>93</span>
What have I done? I&rsquo;m as sober as any one here, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; William
took the heavy man gently by the arm and persuaded him
to his feet. The other guests suppressed their smiles and remained
discreetly quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;my car&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; sputtered Gannette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have Henri take him to his club, William,&rdquo; said the Beaubien,
rising. &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Gannette. We will expect you
Wednesday evening, and we trust that we will not have to accept
your excuses again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gannette was led soddenly out. The Beaubien quietly resumed
her seat. It was the second time the man had been
dismissed from her table, and the guests marveled that it did
not mean the final loss of her favor. But she remained inscrutable;
and the conversation quickly drifted into new channels.
A few moments later William returned and made a quiet
announcement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.
The Beaubien immediately rose and advanced to greet the
newcomer. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she whispered, taking his hand.</p>
<p>The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face. His
only reply was a reassuring pressure of her hand. But she
comprehended, and her face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, &ldquo;the
President&rsquo;s message is out. I have been going over it with
Hood&ndash;&ndash;which accounts for my tardiness,&rdquo; he added, nodding
pleasantly to the Beaubien. &ldquo;Quoting from our chief executive&rsquo;s
long list of innocent platitudes, I may say that &lsquo;private
monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly indefensible, and not
to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the premise of
equal rights to all mankind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; concurred Weston, holding up his glass
and gazing admiringly at the rich color of the wine.</p>
<p>The others laughed. &ldquo;Quite my sentiments, too,&rdquo; murmured
Fitch, rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor
success to assume a beatific expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; continued Ames, with mock gravity, &ldquo;the
interlocking of corporation directorates must be prohibited by
law; power must be conferred upon the Interstate Commerce
Commission to superintend the financial management of railroads;
holding-companies must cease to exist; and corrective
policies must be shaped, whereby so-called &lsquo;trusts&rsquo; will be
regulated and rendered innocuous. Are we agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said they all, in one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carried,&rdquo; concluded Ames in a solemn tone. Then a burst
of laughter rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William
smiled behind his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page94' name='book3_page94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, seriously,&rdquo; said Weston, when the laughter had ceased,
&ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve got a President now who&rsquo;s going to do something,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; replied Ames emphatically. &ldquo;As long as the
human mind remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though
Congress legislate itself blue in the face. Reform is not to be
made like a garment and forced upon the people from the outside.
It is a growth from within. Restrictive measures have
not as yet, in all the history of civilization, reformed a single
criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Hood say?&rdquo; asked Murdock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we are puncture-proof,&rdquo; replied Ames with a light
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about your indictment in that cotton deal? Is
Hood going to find you law-proof there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case is settled,&rdquo; said Ames easily. &ldquo;I went into court
this morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring
to corner the cotton market two years ago. I admitted that I
violated the Sherman law. The judge promptly fined me three
thousand dollars, for which I immediately wrote a check, leaving
me still the winner by some two million seven hundred
thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing of compound interest
on the three thousand for the past two years. You see the
beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us
in on that!&rdquo; exclaimed Kane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Ames simply.
&ldquo;You will have to keep out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, &ldquo;suppose
we get down to the business of the evening&ndash;&ndash;if agreeable to
our hostess,&rdquo; bowing in the direction of the Beaubien.</p>
<p>The latter nodded her approval of the suggestion. &ldquo;Has
any one anything new to offer?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Some moments of silence followed. Then Ames spoke.
&ldquo;There is a little matter,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I have been revolving
for some days. Perhaps it may interest you. It concerns the
Albany post road. It occurred to me some time ago that a
franchise for a trolley line on that road could be secured and
ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy residents
whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million dollars
rather than have a line built there. After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building
of the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner
of Highways. He reported that it would be the means of destroying
the post road. I convinced him, on the other hand,
that it would be the means of lining his purse with fifty thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page95' name='book3_page95'></a>95</span>
dollars. So he very naturally gave it his endorsement. I
then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and had him
arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany. I think,&rdquo; he
concluded, &ldquo;that about five hundred thousand dollars will
grease the wheels all &rsquo;round. I&rsquo;ve got the Governor on the hip
in that Southern Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out
of my hand. I&rsquo;ll lay this project on the table now, and you
can take it up if you so desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scheme seems all right,&rdquo; commented Weston, after a
short meditation. &ldquo;But the profits are not especially large.
What else have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us
would at least provide for a yachting party next summer,&rdquo; remarked
Ames sententiously. &ldquo;And no work connected with
it&ndash;&ndash;in fact, the work has been done. I shall want an additional
five per cent for handling it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a
motion that the group definitely take up the project. The
Beaubien put the vote, and it was carried without dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that potato scheme you were figuring on,
Ames?&rdquo; asked Fitch at this juncture. &ldquo;Anything ever come
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get much encouragement
from my friends,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;A perfectly feasible scheme,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; put in Weston emphatically. &ldquo;It never
could be put through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one million dollars that says it could,&rdquo; returned
Ames calmly. &ldquo;Will you cover it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender. &ldquo;Not
I!&rdquo; he exclaimed, scurrying for cover.</p>
<p>Ames laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;suppose we look into the
scheme and see if we don&rsquo;t want to handle it. It simply calls
for a little thought and work. The profits would be tremendous.
Shall I explain?&rdquo; He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien
for approval. She nodded, and he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lately been investigating the subject of various
food supplies other than wheat and corn as possible bases for
speculation, and my attention has been drawn strongly to a
very humble one, potatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh followed this announcement. But Ames
continued unperturbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so
plentiful at times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.
My investigations have covered a period of several months, and
now I have in my possession a large map of the United States
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page96' name='book3_page96'></a>96</span>
with the potato sections, prices, freight rates and all other necessary
data indicated. The results are interesting. My idea
is to send agents into all these sections next summer before
the potatoes are turned up, and contract for the entire crop at
twenty-five cents a bushel. The agents will pay the farmers
cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging, packing,
shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption. Needless to say, the potatoes
will not be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot
in the ground. Those that do reach the market will sell for
a dollar and a half in New York and Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; added Fitch, &ldquo;you are simply figuring
to corner the market for the humble tuber, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you say you have all the necessary data now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All, even to the selection of a few of my agents. I can
control freight rates for what we may wish to ship. The rest
of the crop will be left to rot. The farmers will jump at such
a bargain. And the consumers will pay our price for what they
must have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; mused Murdock. &ldquo;And how much do you
figure we shall need to round the corner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million, cash in hand,&rdquo; replied Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this anything that the women can mix into?&rdquo; asked
Fitch suddenly. &ldquo;You know they forced us to dump tons of
our cold-storage stuff onto the market two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was when I controlled wheat,&rdquo; said Ames, &ldquo;and was
all tied up. But this is a wholly different proposition. It will
be done so quietly and thoroughly that it will all be over and
the profits pocketed before the women wake up to what we&rsquo;re
doing. In this case there will be nothing to store. And potatoes
exposed in the field rot quickly, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some
moments. Then the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if
he would agree to handle the project, provided they took it
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Ames, &ldquo;on a five per cent basis. And I am
ready to put agents in the field to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Madam Beaubien,&rdquo; said Fitch, &ldquo;I move that we adopt
the plan as set forth by Mr. Ames, and commission him to
handle it, calling upon us equally for whatever funds he may
need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution
was unanimously adopted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ames,&rdquo; queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in
his eyes, &ldquo;will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and
R.?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page97' name='book3_page97'></a>97</span>
A laugh went up around the table, in which Ames himself
joined. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;potatoes and cotton will both go over
that road next summer, and I shall fix the rebates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your friend Ketchim?&rdquo; suggested Fitch, with
a wink at Murdock.</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face. &ldquo;Ketchim
is going to Sing Sing for that little deal,&rdquo; he returned in
a low, cold tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not
repress a little shudder. &ldquo;I had him on Molino, but he trumped
up a new company which absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody,
so I am blocked for the present. But, mark me, I shall
strip him of every dollar, and then put him behind the bars before
I&rsquo;ve finished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he
spoke truth.</p>
<p>At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall
clock were sending their trembling message through the dark
house, the Beaubien rose, and the dinner was concluded. A
few moments later the guests were spinning in their cars to
their various homes or clubs&ndash;&ndash;all but Ames. As he was preparing
to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;Wait
a moment, Wilton,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have something important to
discuss with you.&rdquo; She led him into the morning room, where
a fire was blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair
before it for him, then nestled on the floor at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent Gannette home this evening,&rdquo; she began, by way of
introduction. &ldquo;He was drunk. I would drop him entirely, only
you said&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need him,&rdquo; interrupted Ames. &ldquo;Hold him a while
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you. Now tell
me,&rdquo; she went on eagerly, &ldquo;what about Colombia? Have you
any further news from Wenceslas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cable to-day. Everything&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t worry.
The Church is with the Government, and they will win&ndash;&ndash;although
your money may be tied up for a few years. Still, you
can&rsquo;t lose in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.
Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lafelle was here again to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him, too,&rdquo; said Ames quickly. &ldquo;Looks as if I had
made you a sort of holding company, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added,
with a chuckle. &ldquo;But we shall have good use for these fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave me some very interesting news,&rdquo; she said; and
then went on to relate the conversation in detail. Ames laughed
loudly as he listened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page98' name='book3_page98'></a>98</span>
&ldquo;And now, Wilton,&rdquo; said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, &ldquo;you have always said that you never
forgave me for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had
him by the throat. Well, I&rsquo;m going to give you a chance to get
more than even. Jim&rsquo;s fat widow is after your wife&rsquo;s scalp. I
intend that she shall lose her own in the chase. I&rsquo;ve got my
plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet the lovely Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch&rsquo;s next Thursday afternoon. It
will be just a formal call&ndash;&ndash;mutual introductions&ndash;&ndash;and, later,
an invitation from Mrs. Ames to Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. Meantime,
I want you to get Mrs. Hawley-Crowles involved in a
financial way, and shear her of every penny! Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames looked at her quizzically. Then he broke into another
sharp laugh. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said he, taking her hand, &ldquo;you
are charming this evening. Added years only make you more
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Will!&rdquo; she deprecated, although the smile she
gave him attested her pleasure in the compliment. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she
continued briskly, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m so beautiful, you can&rsquo;t help loving
me; and if you love me, you will do what I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He playfully pinched her cheek. &ldquo;Why, poor old Jim
Crowles! Really, I&rsquo;ve long since forgotten him. Do you realize
that that was more than ten years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mention years, dear,&rdquo; she murmured, shuddering
a little. &ldquo;Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy
a lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he suggested, laughing, &ldquo;we might get Ketchim
after her, to sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when
he goes down, as he is going one of these days, we will hope
that it will leave her on the rocks of financial ruin, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Ketchim promoting?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I know nothing
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing
the sonorous title of Simit&iacute; Development Company, I am told
by my brokers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simit&iacute;! Why&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve heard Carmen mention that name.
I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and who is Carmen?&rdquo; he asked with a show of real
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little friend&ndash;&ndash;the one and only honest person I&rsquo;ve ever
dealt with, excepting, of course, present company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amendment is accepted. And now where does this
Carmen enter the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;surely you know about her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did I should not ask.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page99' name='book3_page99'></a>99</span>
&ldquo;Well, she is a little Colombian&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colombian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They say she&rsquo;s an Inca princess. Came up with the
engineers who went down there for Ketchim to examine the
Molino properties. She lived all her life in a town called Simit&iacute;
until she came up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire. &ldquo;Never
heard of the place,&rdquo; he murmured dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Beaubien eagerly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a&ndash;&ndash;a wonderful
child! I&rsquo;m different when I&rsquo;m with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the
woman. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d advise you not to be with her much, for I
prefer you as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat some minutes in silence. Then the woman looked
up at her companion. &ldquo;What are you thinking about so
seriously?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little
nervous laugh. &ldquo;Of you,&rdquo; he replied evasively, &ldquo;always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly. &ldquo;You
were dreaming of your awful business deals,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What
have you in hand now?&ndash;&ndash;besides the revolution in Colombia,
your mines, your mills, your banks, your railroads and trolley
lines, your wheat and potato corners, your land concessions
and cattle schemes, and&ndash;&ndash;well, that&rsquo;s a start, at least,&rdquo; she
finished, pausing for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another big deal,&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheat, again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, cotton. I&rsquo;m buying every bale I can find, in Europe,
Asia, and the States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Will, you&rsquo;ve been caught in cotton before, you know.
And I don&rsquo;t believe you can get away with it again. Unless&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&ndash;&ndash;unless,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just the
part I have taken care of. It&rsquo;s a matter of tariff. The cotton
schedule will go through as I have it outlined. I practically
own the Commission. They don&rsquo;t dare refuse to pass the
measure. Cotton is low now. In a few months the tariff on
cotton products will be up. The new tariff-wall sends the
price of raw stuff soaring. I profit, coming and going. I was
beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather prognostications.
I made a bad guess. This time the weather
doesn&rsquo;t figure. I&rsquo;ll let you in, if you wish. But these other
fellows have got to stay out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a penny to invest, Will,&rdquo; she replied mournfully.
&ldquo;You got me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he returned easily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you what you need,
any amount. And you can give me your advice and suggestions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page100' name='book3_page100'></a>100</span>
from time to time. As for your Colombian investments, haven&rsquo;t
I guaranteed them, practically?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in writing,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him with a twinkle
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Well, do you want that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; she returned, giving him a glance of
admiration. &ldquo;But, to return, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles is going to
be received into your wife&rsquo;s set, and you are going to give her a
good financial whipping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it. I&rsquo;m yours to command. Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles shall go to the poor-house, if you say the
word. But now, my dear, have William order my car. And,
let me see, Mrs. Ames is to meet Mrs. Hawley-Crowles at
Fitch&rsquo;s? Just a chance call, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing
him; &ldquo;next Thursday at three. Good night. Call me on
the &rsquo;phone to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>
</div>
<p>The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was
originally only five stories in height. But as the Ames
interests grew, floor after floor was added, until, on the
day that Mrs. Hawley-Crowles pointed it out to Carmen from
the window of her limousine, it had reached, tower and all, a
height of twenty-five stories, and was increasing at an average
rate of two additional a year. It was not its size that aroused
interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but its uniqueness;
for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not house
a single business that was not either owned outright or controlled
by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and
Company on the second floor. The haberdashers, the shoe-shining
booths, the soda fountains, and the great commercial
enterprises that dwelt about them, each and all acknowledged
fealty and paid homage to the man who brooded over them
in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor in the tower
above.</p>
<p>It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers
of New York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer
force of what was doubtless the most dominant character developed
in recent years by those peculiar forces which have
produced the American multimillionaire. &ldquo;Mental dynamite!&rdquo;
was Weston&rsquo;s characterization of the man. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page101' name='book3_page101'></a>101</span>
added, when, despite his anger, he could not but admire Ames&rsquo;s
tactical blocking of his piratical move, which the former&rsquo;s keen
foresight had perceived threatened danger at Washington,
&ldquo;it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him, but because
he knows ten tricks to our one, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant,
generally, an expression of admiration for his unusual
physique, and a wholly erroneous appraisal of his character.
His build was that of a gladiator. He stood six-feet-four in
height, with Herculean shoulders and arms, and a pair of legs
that suggested nothing so much as the great pillars which
supported the facade of the Ames building. Those arms and
legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college shell
to victory every year that he had sat in the boat. They had
won every game on the gridiron in which he had participated
as the greatest &ldquo;center&rdquo; the college ever developed. For baseball
he was a bit too massive, much to his own disappointment,
but the honors he failed to secure there he won in the field
events, and in the surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling
bouts when, hidden away in the cellar of some secret society
hall, he would crush his opponents with an ease and a peculiar
glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes that was grimly prophetic
of days to come. His mental attitude toward contests for
superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially from
that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win. If
he fell, well and good; he expected &ldquo;thumbs down.&rdquo; If he
won, his opponent need look for no exhibition of generosity
on his part. When his man lay prone before him, he stooped
and cut his throat. And he would have loathed the one who
forbore to do likewise with himself.</p>
<p>In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the
physical side of his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable
muscular strength so great a prize to the various
athletic coaches and directors. Ames was first an animal;
there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong to arouse his
latent spirituality. And yet his intellect was keen; and to
those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of
finance, he brought a power of concentration that was as stupendous
as his physical strength. His mental make-up was
peculiar, in that it was the epitome of energy&ndash;&ndash;manifested at
first only in brute force&ndash;&ndash;and in that it was wholly deficient in
the sense of fear. Because of this his daring was phenomenal.</p>
<p>Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated
with his father in the already great banking house of Ames
and Company. But the animality of his nature soon found the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page102' name='book3_page102'></a>102</span>
confinement irksome; his father&rsquo;s greater conservatism hampered
his now rapidly expanding spirit of commercialism; and
after a few years in the banking house he withdrew and set
up for himself. The father, while lacking the boy&rsquo;s fearlessness,
had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son&rsquo;s desire, and, in addition, gave him <i>carte
blanche</i> in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.</p>
<p>Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name,
already becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance,
with diversified enterprises which reached into almost every
country of the globe, hastened home from a foreign land in
response to a message announcing the sudden death of his
father. The devolving of his parent&rsquo;s vast fortune upon himself&ndash;&ndash;he
was the sole heir&ndash;&ndash;then necessitated his permanent
location in New York. And so, reluctantly giving up his
travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about him, concentrating
his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his
huge fortune. A few months later he married, and the union
amalgamated the proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears
fought under the Conqueror and were written in the
Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and aristocratic Van Heyse
branch of old Amsterdam. To this union were born a son
and a daughter, twins.</p>
<p>The interval between his graduation from college and the
death of his father was all but unknown to the cronies of his
subsequent years in New York. Though he had spent much of
it in the metropolis, he had been self-centered and absorbed,
even lonely, while laying his plans and developing the schemes
which resulted in financial pre&euml;minence. With unlimited
money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice of his
business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe. Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had
become as well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges
of Europe as in his native land. Confident and successful from
the outset; without any trace of pride or touch of hauteur in
his nature; as wholly lacking in ethical development and in
generosity as he was in fear; gradually becoming more sociable
and companionable, although still reticent of certain periods
of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with years;
and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low
plane of his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly
for the pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power
which his accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page103' name='book3_page103'></a>103</span>
it served as an adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost
superhuman, driving energy. If he betrayed and debauched
ideals, it was because he was utterly incapable of
rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the attempt. If
he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he glanced
at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the
lenses of self. His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton
Ames&ndash;&ndash;and he never looked beyond. The world had been
created for him; the cosmos but expressed his Ego.</p>
<p>On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien
regarding the social aspirations of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, the
financier sat at his rich mahogany desk on the top floor of
the Ames building in earnest discussion with his lawyer,
Alonzo Hood. The top floor of the tower was divided into
eight rooms. Two of these constituted Ames&rsquo;s inner <i>sanctum</i>;
one was Hood&rsquo;s private office; and the rest were devoted to
clerks and stenographers. A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood&rsquo;s room, and handled confidential messages
over private wires to the principal cities in the country. A
private telephone connected Ames&rsquo;s desk with the Beaubien
mansion. Private lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to
various other points throughout the city. The telegraph and
telephone companies gave his messages preference over all
others. At a word he would be placed in almost instant communication
with New Orleans, San Francisco, London, Berlin,
or Cairo. Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual
was doing business. At the office of the Telegraph Service
up-town he maintained messengers who carried none but his
own despatches. In the railroad yards his private car stood
always in readiness; and in the harbor his yacht was kept constantly
under steam. A motor car stood ever in waiting in
the street below, close to the shaft of a private automatic elevator,
which ran through the building for his use alone. This
elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the basement of the
building, where a private room and a special waiter were
always at the man&rsquo;s disposal. A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and
he had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club
up-town.</p>
<p>This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o&rsquo;clock.
Before him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his
mills, his railroads, and his bank. These disposed of, there
followed a quick survey of the day&rsquo;s appointments, arranged
for him by his chief secretary. Then he summoned Hood. As
the latter entered, Ames was absorbed in the legend of the
stock ticker.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page104' name='book3_page104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six,&rdquo; he commented.
Then, swinging back in his chair, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Stolz doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,&rdquo;
replied Hood.</p>
<p>Ames chuckled. &ldquo;Now we will begin to get real information,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty
dollars a week from now on; but she is to deliver to you a
carbon copy of every letter she writes for Stolz. And I want
those copies on my desk every morning when I come down.
Hood,&rdquo; he continued, abruptly turning the conversation, &ldquo;what
have you dug up about Ketchim&rsquo;s new company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, sir,&rdquo; replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment.
&ldquo;His lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise
enough not to talk. I called on him yesterday afternoon to
have a little chat about the old Molino company, representing
that I was speaking for certain stockholders. But he told me to
bring the stockholders in and he would talk with them personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly. &ldquo;Is
that the sort of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar
salary?&rdquo; he bantered. &ldquo;Hood, I&rsquo;m ashamed of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame you; I am ashamed of myself,&rdquo; replied the
lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Ames good-naturedly, &ldquo;leave Ketchim
to me. I&rsquo;ve got three men now buying small amounts of stock
in his various companies. I&rsquo;ll call for receiverships pretty
soon, and we will see this time that he doesn&rsquo;t refund the
money. Now about other matters: the Albany post trolley
deal is to go through. Also the potato scheme. Work up the
details and let me have them at once. Have you got the senate
bill drawn for Gossitch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be ready this afternoon. As it stands now, the
repealing section gives any city the right to grant saloon
licenses of indefinite length, instead of for one year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. We want the bill so drawn that it will
become practically impossible to revoke a license.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it now reads,&rdquo; said Hood, &ldquo;it makes a saloon license
assignable. That creates a property right that can hardly be
revoked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; returned Ames. &ldquo;As I figure, it will create a
value of some twenty millions for those who own saloons in
New York. A tidy sum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means for the brewers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And distillers, yes. And if the United States ever reaches
the point where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe
them out, it will face a very handsome little expenditure.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page105' name='book3_page105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames, a very large part of the stock of American
brewing companies is owned in Europe. How are you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nominally, it is. But for two years, and more, I have
been quietly gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and
to-day I have some ten millions in my own control, from
actual purchases, options, and so forth. I&rsquo;m going to organize
a holding company, when the time arrives, and I figure that
within the next year or so we will practically control the production
of beer and spirituous liquors in the United States and
Europe. The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a pleasure to undertake it,&rdquo; replied Hood with
animation. &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Ames, I got in touch with Senator
Mall last evening at the club, and he assures me that the senate
committee have so changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on
cotton products that the clause you wish retained will be continued
with its meaning unaltered. In fact, the discrimination
which the hosiery interests desire will be fully observed. Your
suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per cent on hose
valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is exceptionally
clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less than that
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed again. &ldquo;Triumphant Republicanism,&rdquo; he
commented. &ldquo;And right in the face of the President&rsquo;s message.
Wire Mall that I will be in Washington Thursday evening
to advise with him further about it. And you will go
with me. Hood, we&rsquo;ve got a fight on in regard to the President&rsquo;s
idea of granting permission in private suits to use judgments
and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations. That idea has got to be killed! And
the regulation of security issues of railroads&ndash;&ndash;preposterous!
Why, the President&rsquo;s crazy! If Mall and Gossitch and Wells
don&rsquo;t oppose that in the Senate, I&rsquo;ll see that they are up before
the lunacy commission&ndash;&ndash;and I have some influence with that
body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to fear, I think,&rdquo; replied Hood reassuringly.
&ldquo;An important piece of business legislation like that
will hardly go through this session. And then we will have
time to prepare to frustrate it. The suggestion to place the
New York Stock Exchange under government supervision is
a much more serious matter, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Hood,&rdquo; said Ames, leaning forward and laying
a hand upon that gentleman&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;when that happens, we&rsquo;ll
have either a Socialist president or a Catholic in the White
House, with Rome twitching the string. Then I shall move to
my Venezuelan estates, take the vow of poverty, and turn
monk.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page106' name='book3_page106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Which reminds me again that by your continued relations
with Rome you are doing much to promote just that state of
affairs,&rdquo; returned the lawyer sententiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said Ames. &ldquo;But I find the Catholic Church
convenient&ndash;&ndash;indeed, necessary&ndash;&ndash;for the promotion of certain
plans. And so I use it. The Colombian revolution, for example.
But I shall abruptly sever my relations with that institution
some day&ndash;&ndash;when I am through with it. At present
I am milking the Church to the extent of a brimming pail every
year; and as long as the udder is full and accessible I shall
continue to tap it. I tapped the Presbyterian Church, through
Borwell, last year, if you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment
with the morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written
to letters of such nature as he could attend to without suggestions
from his chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; remarked Hood when he saw the letters,
&ldquo;I had word from Collins this morning that he had secured a
signed statement from that fellow Marcus, who was crushed
in the Avon mills yesterday. Marcus accepted the medical
services of our physicians, and died in our hospital. Just
before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of one hundred
dollars. Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand. So that matter&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Ames, looking up from his mail;
&ldquo;we are going to close the mills earlier this year on account
of the cotton shortage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hood gave a low whistle. &ldquo;That spells trouble, in capital
letters!&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Four thousand hands idle for three
months, I suppose. By George! we just escaped disaster last
year, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be more than three months this time,&rdquo; commented
Ames with a knowing look. Then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Hood, I verily believe you
are a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; replied the latter slowly, &ldquo;I certainly
would hesitate to do some of the things you do. Yet you seem
to get away with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perk up, Hood,&rdquo; laughed Ames. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got real work for
you as soon as I get control of C. and R. I&rsquo;m going to put you
in as president, at a salary of one hundred thousand per annum.
Then you are going to buy the road for me for about two
million dollars, and I&rsquo;ll reorganize and sell to the stockholders
for five millions, still retaining control. The road is only a
scrap heap, but its control is the first step toward the amalgamation
of the trolley interests of New England. Laws are
going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page107' name='book3_page107'></a>107</span>
But that&rsquo;s your end of the business. It&rsquo;s up to you to get
around the Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you
can, and buttress this little monopoly against competition and
reform-infected legislatures. I don&rsquo;t care what it costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Crabbe?&rdquo; asked Hood dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send Crabbe to the Senate,&rdquo; Ames coolly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the
people, Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget nothing, sir. The people are New York City,
Buffalo, and Albany. Tammany is New York. And Tammany
at present is in my pocket. Buffalo and Albany can be swept
by the Catholic vote. And I have that in the upper right hand
drawer of my private file. The &lsquo;people&rsquo; will therefore elect to
the Senate the man I choose. In fact, I prefer direct election
of senators over the former method, for the people are greater
fools <i>en masse</i> than any State Legislature that ever assembled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and
glanced through it. &ldquo;From Borwell,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Protests
against the way you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light
injunction bill. Pretty clever, that, Hood. I really didn&rsquo;t think
it was in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invoking the referendum, you mean?&rdquo; said Hood, puffing
a little with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped
out the whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now
get from my shacks down there. Now next year we will be
better prepared to fight the bill. The press will be with us
then&ndash;&ndash;a little cheaper and a trifle more degraded than it is
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A private messenger entered with a cablegram. Ames read
it and handed it to his lawyer. &ldquo;The <i>Proteus</i> has reached the
African Gold Coast at last,&rdquo; he said. Then he threw back his
head and laughed heartily. &ldquo;Do you know, Hood, the <i>Proteus</i>
carried two missionaries, sent to the frizzle-topped Zulus by
Borwell and his outfit. Deutsch and Company cable that they
have arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Hood in some perplexity, &ldquo;the cargo of the
<i>Proteus</i> was rum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; roared Ames; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where the joke comes in.
I make it a point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary
to a foreign field shall also carry a cargo of rum. The
combination is one that the Zulu finds simply irresistible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; commented Hood, &ldquo;the Church goes down to Egypt
for help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; returned Ames. &ldquo;I carry the missionaries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page108' name='book3_page108'></a>108</span>
free on my rum boats. Great saving to the Board of Foreign
Missions, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration
of his cunning. &ldquo;And did you likewise send missionaries
to China with your opium cargoes?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Ames chuckled. &ldquo;I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong
on a boat loaded to the rails with opium. We had insisted
on his taking a needed vacation, and so packed him off
to Europe. In Bombay I cabled him to take the <i>Crotus</i> to
Hongkong, transportation free. That was my last consignment
of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen upon
our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.
I had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India,
and I&rsquo;d have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for
the pressure of public sentiment. However, we&rsquo;re going to
educate John Chinaman to substitute whiskey for opium. But
now,&rdquo; glancing at the great electric wall clock, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wasted
enough time with you. By the way, do you know why this
Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hood, standing in anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty thousand chests of opium,&rdquo; returned Ames laconically.
&ldquo;Value, fifty million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of
Shanghai and Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the
opium. That necessitated a few plain words from me to the
President, and a quick trip from Washington to London afterwards
to interview his most Christian British Majesty. A very
pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very! Now tell Willett I
want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration,
and left the room. Willett&rsquo;s entrance followed immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant
hour,&rdquo; commanded Ames. &ldquo;Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas,
of Cartagena, and ask him if an American mining company is
registered there under the name of Simit&iacute; Development Company,
and what properties they have and where located. Tell
him to cable reply, and follow with detailed letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes. &ldquo;The
Congregation of the Sacred Index has laid the ban on&ndash;&ndash;what&rsquo;s
the name of the book?&rdquo; He drew out a card-index drawer and
selected a card, which he tossed to the secretary. &ldquo;There it is.
Get me the book at once.&rdquo; He seemed to muse a while, then
went on slowly. &ldquo;Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in New York.
Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.
Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page109' name='book3_page109'></a>109</span>
Bureau must not be taken from the table. That&rsquo;s final. Wire
the Sequana Coal Company that I want their report to-morrow,
without fail. Wire Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners&rsquo;
Union I have nothing to discuss with them. Now send Hodson
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett
the chief of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the
captain of his force of brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose
knowledge of the market and whose ability in the matter of
stock trading was almost uncanny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your selection for to-day, Hodson?&rdquo; asked Ames,
as the man entered.</p>
<p>Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris. Ames glanced
over them hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that
did not meet his approval, and substituting others in which
for particular reasons he wished to trade that morning.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your reason for thinking I ought to buy Public Utilities?&rdquo;
he asked, looking up at his broker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract,&rdquo;
replied Hodson.</p>
<p>Ames studied the broker&rsquo;s face a moment. Then his own
brightened, as he began to divine the man&rsquo;s reason. &ldquo;By
George!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;you think there&rsquo;s quicksand along
the proposed route?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Hodson calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them,&rdquo; returned
Ames quickly. Then&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to attend a meeting of
the Council of American Grain Exchanges at two to-day. I
want you to be just outside the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodson nodded understandingly. Ames concluded, &ldquo;I
guess that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade
at ten-thirty; Stock Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector&rsquo;s
at twelve sharp, returning here immediately afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his
various commissions.</p>
<p>For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning&rsquo;s
quota of letters and messages, making frequent notes, and often
turning to the telephone at his hand. Then he summoned a
stenographer and rapidly dictated a number of replies. Finally
he again called Willett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to
Lafelle, I want to see Reverend Darius Borwell,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;wire Strunz that I want a meeting of
the Brewers&rsquo; Union called at the earliest possible date. By the
way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the night with me on board
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page110' name='book3_page110'></a>110</span>
the <i>Cossack</i>, and if so, notify Captain McCall. That will save
an hour in the day. Here is a bundle of requests for charity,
for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums, and various
homes. Turn them all down, regretfully. H&rsquo;m! &rsquo;Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour
and go over my schedule with me. By the way, tell Hood to
take steps at once to foreclose on the Bradley estate. Did you
find out where Ketchim does his banking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the secretary, &ldquo;the Commercial State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, get the president, Mr. Colson, on the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial
State bank its note against the Ketchim Realty Company
for ten thousand dollars. &ldquo;I thought Ketchim would be
borrowing again,&rdquo; he chuckled, when he had completed the
transaction. &ldquo;His brains are composed of a disastrous mixture
of hypocrisy and greed. I&rsquo;ve thrown another hook into him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended
in his elevator to the banking house on the second floor. He
entered the directors&rsquo; room with a determined carriage, nodding
pleasantly to his associates. Taking his seat as chairman,
he promptly called the meeting to order.</p>
<p>Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes,
and then Ames announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public
sixty millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised
you to take them at a premium of six per cent, you
objected. I overruled you, and the bank bought the bonds.
Within forty-eight hours they were resold at a premium of
seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred thousand. A
fair two days&rsquo; business. Now let me suggest that the psychology
of this transaction is worth your study. A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to
pay a dollar and a half for it. Then a lot of people will want
it, until somebody else offers a bid of two. Then the price will
soar, and the number of those who covet the article and
scramble for it will increase proportionably. Take this thought
home with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of admiration rose from the directors. &ldquo;I
think,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;that we had better send Mr. Ames to Washington
to confer with the President in regard to the proposed
currency legislation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is already arranged,&rdquo; put in Ames. &ldquo;I meet the
President next Thursday for a conference on this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he proves intractable?&rdquo; queried another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in that case,&rdquo; returned Ames with a knowing smile,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page111' name='book3_page111'></a>111</span>
&ldquo;I think we had better give him a little lesson to take out of
office with him&ndash;&ndash;one that will ruin his second-term hopes&ndash;&ndash;and
then close our bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange,
and his luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his
office for the private interviews which his chief secretary had
arranged. Then followed further consultations with Hood
over the daily, weekly, and monthly reports which Ames required
from all the various commercial, financial, and mining
enterprises in which he was interested; further discussions of
plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of cable,
telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor
officers, to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver
his quick, decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.
From eight in the morning until, as was his wont, Ames closed
his desk and entered his private elevator at five-thirty in the
evening, his office flashed with the superenergy of the man,
with his intense activity, his decisive words, and his stupendous
endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless endeavors.
If one should ask what his day really amounted to,
we can but point to these incessant endeavors and their results
in augmenting his already vast material interests and his
colossal fortune, a fortune which Hood believed ran well over a
hundred millions, and which Ames himself knew multiplied
that figure by five or ten. And the fortune was increasing at
a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but continually drew to
himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating, amassing,
and absorbing, and for himself alone.</p>
<p>Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over
the wire with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car
and was driven hastily to his yacht, the <i>Cossack</i>, where Monsignor
Lafelle awaited as his guest. It was one of the few
pleasures which Ames allowed himself during the warm
months, to drop his multifarious interests and spend the night
aboard the <i>Cossack</i>, generally alone, rocking gently on the restless
billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast,
well beyond the roar of the huge <i>arena</i> where human beings,
formed of dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the
image of infinite Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in
the struggle to prove their doubtful right to live.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>
</div>
<p>The <i>Cossack</i>, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping
kitten, and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly
in the dark waters, moved through the frosty
night like a cloud brooding over the deep. Yet it was a cloud
of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a spirit of energy incarnate.
From far aloft its burning eye pierced a channel of
light through the murky darkness ahead. In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly
tossed off on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of
glittering coins to his fawning beggars. From somewhere in
the structure above, the crackling, hissing wireless mechanism
was thrusting its invisible hands out into the night and catching
the fleeting messages that were borne on the intangible
pulsations of the mysterious ether. From time to time these
messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver
and cut glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath
a torrent of white light, sat the gigantic being whose
will directed the movements of this floating palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of
sentimentalism. From the business standpoint, the Protestant
Church is a dead failure. It doesn&rsquo;t get results that are in any
way commensurate with its investment. But your Church is a
success&ndash;&ndash;from the point of dollars and cents. In fact, in the
matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I take off my
hat to the Vatican. You fellows have got us all beaten. Every
day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public. And so you see why I take such
pleasure in talking with really astute churchmen like yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain
just what interpretation to put upon the remark. The
Japanese servant was clearing away the remnants of the meal,
having first lighted the cigars of the master and guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair
and musing over his cigar, &ldquo;the purgatory idea is one of the
cleverest schemes ever foisted upon the unthinking masses,
and it has proved a veritable Klondike. Gad! if I could think
up and put over a thing like that I&rsquo;d consider myself really
possessed of brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I fear, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he replied
adroitly, &ldquo;you do not know your Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page113' name='book3_page113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true. I don&rsquo;t suppose I ever in my life read a
whole chapter in the book. I can&rsquo;t swallow such stuff, Lafelle&ndash;&ndash;utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and
natural laws, as we know and are able to observe them. Even
as a child I never had any use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.
I always wanted facts, tangible, concrete, irrefutable
facts, not hypotheses. The Protestant churches hand out a
mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many interpretations
of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently interested
to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when hard-headed
business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it. It&rsquo;s
preposterous, Lafelle! If they had anything tangible to offer,
it would be different. But I go to church for the looks of the
thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn&rsquo;t know about God and man. Then at the close of the
service I drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment,
and go away with the feeling that I didn&rsquo;t get my
money&rsquo;s worth. From a business point of view, a Protestant
church service is worth about twenty-five cents for the music,
and five cents for the privilege of sleeping on a soft cushion.
So you see I lose four dollars and seventy cents every time I
attend. You Catholic fellows, with your ceremonial and legerdemain,
give a much better entertainment. Besides, I like to
hear your priests soak it to their cowering flocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle sighed. &ldquo;I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles,&rdquo;
he said with a rueful air. &ldquo;I am sorry you take such a
harsh attitude toward us. We are really more spiritual&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
he pleaded, holding up a hand. &ldquo;Why, Lafelle, you old fraud,
I look upon your Church as a huge business institution, a
gigantic trust, as mercenary and merciless as Steel, Oil, or
Tobacco! Why, you and I are in the same business, that of
making money! And I&rsquo;d like to borrow some of your methods.
You catch &rsquo;em through religion. I have to use other methods.
But the end is the same. Only, you&rsquo;ve got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my
own making. Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious
methods; while I have to hire expensive legal talent to get
around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be fairly successful, even at that,&rdquo; retorted
Lafelle. Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious
argument that might end in straining their now cordial and
mutually helpful friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar:
&ldquo;May I ask what you pay for these?&ndash;&ndash;for only an inexhaustible
bank reserve can warrant their like.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page114' name='book3_page114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at
once. &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he said, tenderly regarding the thick, black
weed in his fingers, &ldquo;are grown exclusively for me on my own
plantation in Colombia. They cost me about one dollar and
sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door in New York. I
searched the world over before I found the only spot where
such tobacco could be grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this wine?&rdquo; continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of
sparkling champagne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada,
Spain,&rdquo; replied Ames. &ldquo;I have my own wine press and bottling
plant there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of
luxury. &ldquo;And does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea
and coffee?&rdquo; he ventured, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Ames. &ldquo;I grow tea for my table in both
China and Ceylon. And I have exclusive coffee plantations in
Java and Brazil. But I&rsquo;m now negotiating for one in Colombia,
for I think that, without doubt, the finest coffee in the world
is grown there, although it never gets beyond the coast line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fortuna non deo</i>,&rdquo; murmured the churchman; &ldquo;you man
of chance and destiny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed genially. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have
always insisted that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but
I am a gambler. My god is chance. With ordinary judgment
and horse-sense, I take risks that no so-called sane man would
consider. The curse of the world is fear&ndash;&ndash;the chief instrument
that you employ to hold the masses to your churchly system.
I was born without it. I know that as long as a business opponent
has fear to contend with, I am his master. Fear is at the
root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment. I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word. Hence my position in
the business world. Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations
of superstition, religious or otherwise. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, &ldquo;in a sense I
do. But you greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own
powerful intellect. I know of no brain but yours that could
have put South Ohio Oil from one hundred and fifty dollars up
to over two thousand a share. I had a few shares of that stock
myself. But I held until it broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames smiled knowingly. &ldquo;Sorry I didn&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I could have saved you. I didn&rsquo;t own a dollar&rsquo;s
worth of South Ohio. Oh, yes,&rdquo; he added, as he saw Lafelle&rsquo;s
eyes widening in surprise, &ldquo;I pushed the market up until a
certain lady, whom you and I both know, thought it unwise to
go further, and then I sprung the sudden discovery of Colombian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page115' name='book3_page115'></a>115</span>
oil fields on them; and the market crashed like a burst
balloon. The lady cleared some two millions on the rig. No,
I didn&rsquo;t have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute. It
was American nerve, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Lafelle. &ldquo;If you had lived in the Middle
Ages you&rsquo;d have been burnt for possessing a devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been made a Cardinal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned
the valet to set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ,
and to bring the whiskey and soda.</p>
<p>For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the
supreme luxury of their magnificent environment, the stimulation
of their beverage and cigars, and the soothing effect of the
soft music, combined with the gentle movement of the boat.
Then Ames took his guest into the smoking room proper, and
drew up chairs before a small table, on which were various
papers and writing materials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;referring to your telephone message of
this morning, what is it that you want me to do for you? Is
it the old question of establishing a nunciature at Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment. He
therefore plunged eagerly into his subject. &ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I know you to have great influence at the Capital. In
the interests of humanity, I ask you to use that influence to
prevent the passage of the immigration bill which provides for
a literacy test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames smiled inwardly. There was no need of this request;
for, in the interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship
companies, he intended that there should be no restriction
imposed upon immigration. But the Church was again playing
into his hands, coming to him for favors. And the Church
always paid heavily for his support. &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo; he exclaimed
with an assumption of interest, &ldquo;so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle looked perplexed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Ames explained, &ldquo;how long do you figure it will
take, with unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so
outnumber the Protestants in the United States as to establish
their religion by law and force it into the schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle flushed. &ldquo;But your Constitution provides toleration
for all religions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject
to amendment, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page116' name='book3_page116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger. &ldquo;What a bugaboo
you Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Great
heavens! Why, one would think that we Catholics were all
anarchists! Are we such a menace, such a curse to your
Republican institutions? Do you ever stop to realize what the
Church has done for civilization, and for your own country?
And where, think you, would art and learning be now but for
her? Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed? Good God! You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us
as if we were Hindoo pariahs! This whole country is suffering
from the delirium of Roman Catholic-phobia! Will you drive
us to armed defense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, my friend, calm yourself,&rdquo; soothed Ames, laying a
hand on the irate churchman&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;And please do not class
me with the Protestants, for I am not one of them. You
Catholic fellows have made admirable gains in the past few
years, and your steady encroachments have netted you about
ninety per cent of all the political offices in and about Washington,
so you have no complaint, even if the Church isn&rsquo;t in
politics. H&rsquo;m! So you want my help, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and drummed on the table. Meantime, his
brain was working rapidly. &ldquo;By the way, Lafelle,&rdquo; he said,
abruptly resuming the conversation, &ldquo;you know all about
church laws and customs, running way back to mediaeval
times. Can&rsquo;t you dig up some old provision whereby I can
block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?
If you can, I&rsquo;ll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that&rsquo;s introduced this term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.
Ames went on to express his desire for vengeance upon one
obscure Philip O. Ketchim, broker, promoter, church elder,
and Sunday school superintendent. Lafelle became interested.
The conversation grew more and more animated. Hours
passed.</p>
<p>Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet. &ldquo;My
God, Lafelle, the idea&rsquo;s a corker!&rdquo; he cried, his eyes ablaze.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle laughed softly. &ldquo;From a book entitled &lsquo;Confessions
of a Roman Catholic Priest,&rsquo; written anonymously, but, they
say, by a young attach&eacute; of the Vatican who was insane at the
time. I never learned his name. However, he was apparently
well informed on matters Colombian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you call the law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law of <i>&lsquo;en manos muertas&rsquo;</i>,&rdquo; replied Lafelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Ames, &ldquo;again I take off my hat to your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page117' name='book3_page117'></a>117</span>
churchly system! And now,&rdquo; he continued eagerly, &ldquo;cable the
Pope at once. I&rsquo;ll have the operator send your code ashore by
wireless, and the message will go to Rome to-night. Tell the
old man you&rsquo;ve got influence at work in Washington that is&ndash;&ndash;well,
more than strong, and that the prospects for defeating
the immigration bill are excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the
room. &ldquo;Before I retire, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would like to
express again the admiration which the tasteful luxury of this
smoking room has aroused in me, and to ask, if I may, whether
those stained-glass windows up there are merely fanciful
portraits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful
women portrayed in the rectangular glass windows which lined
the room just below the ceiling. They were exquisitely painted,
in vivid colors, and so set as to be illuminated during the day
by sunlight, and at night by strong electric lamps behind
them. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; he inquired in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; returned Lafelle, &ldquo;if I mistake not, I have seen
a portrait similar to that one,&rdquo; pointing up at one of the windows,
where a sad, wistful face of rare loveliness looked down
upon them.</p>
<p>Ames started slightly. &ldquo;Where, may I ask?&rdquo; he said in a
controlled voice.</p>
<p>Lafelle reflected. In his complete absorption he had not
noticed the effect of his query upon Ames. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo;
he replied slowly. &ldquo;London&ndash;&ndash;Paris&ndash;&ndash;Berlin&ndash;&ndash;no, not there.
And yet, it was in Europe, I am sure. Ah, I have it! In the
Royal Gallery, at Madrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames stared at him dully. &ldquo;In the&ndash;&ndash;Royal Gallery&ndash;&ndash;at
Madrid!&rdquo; he echoed in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait,
&ldquo;I am certain of it. But,&rdquo; turning abruptly upon Ames,
&ldquo;you may have known the original?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames had recovered his composure. &ldquo;I assure you I never
had that pleasure,&rdquo; he said lightly. &ldquo;These art windows were
set in by the designer of the yacht. Clever idea, I thought.
Adds much to the general effect, don&rsquo;t you think? By the way,
if a portrait similar to that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at
Madrid, you might try to learn the identity of the original for
me. It&rsquo;s quite interesting to feel that one may have the picture
of some bewitching member of royalty hanging in his own
apartments. By all means try to learn who the lady is&ndash;&ndash;unless
you know.&rdquo; He stopped and searched the churchman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>But Lafelle shook his head. &ldquo;No, I do not know her. But&ndash;&ndash;that
picture has haunted me from the day I first saw it in
the Royal Gallery. Who designed your yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page118' name='book3_page118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Crafts, of &lsquo;Storrs and Crafts,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Ames. &ldquo;But he
died a year ago. Storrs is gone, too. No help from that
quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door. The valet
appeared at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show Monsignor to his stateroom,&rdquo; commanded Ames.
&ldquo;Good night, Monsignor, good night. Remember, we dock at
seven-thirty, sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed
a message for his wireless operator to send across the
dark waters to the city, and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas,
in Cartagena. This done, he extinguished all the lights in the
room excepting those which illuminated the stained-glass windows
above. Drawing his chair up in front of the one which
had stirred Lafelle&rsquo;s query, he sat before it far into the morning,
in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad features of
the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes murmuring
aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made
long since and worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of
many years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>
</div>
<p>Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot,
calico-clad Carmen had been ejected from unknown
Simit&iacute; and dropped into the midst of the pyrotechnical
society life of the great New World metropolis. Only an unusual
interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result. But that it was a very logical outcome of
the reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust,
and greed, operating through the types of mind among which
her life had been cast, those who have followed our story thus
far can have no doubt. The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve
had been reached through the insane eagerness of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
to outdo her wealthy society rivals in an arrogant
display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious entertaining, and
the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to social leadership.
The coveted prize was now all but within the shallow
woman&rsquo;s grasp. Alas! she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to
ashes.</p>
<p>The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully
followed. Mrs. J. Wilton Ames had met Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&ndash;&ndash;whom,
of course, she had long desired to know more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page119' name='book3_page119'></a>119</span>
intimately&ndash;&ndash;and an interchange of calls had ensued, succeeded
by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the first of the
social season. To this Mrs. Hawley-Crowles floated, as upon
a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she
had rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been
from specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her
rich robe. It was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed,
for she had been conscious of a trace of superciliousness
on the part of some of the gorgeous birds of paradise,
twittering and hopping in their hampering skirts about the
Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at the rare
cakes and ices. But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward
would produce when she should make her bow to these same
vain, haughty devotees of the cult of gold. And she had
wisely planned that Carmen&rsquo;s <i>d&eacute;but</i> should follow that of
Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her rival&rsquo;s in its wanton
display of magnificence.</p>
<p>On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood
of the winter&rsquo;s social orgy. Early in November Kathleen Ames
was duly presented. The occasion was made one of such
stupendous display that Mrs. Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then
shivered with apprehension, lest she be unable to outdo it.
She went home from it in a somewhat chastened frame of
mind, and sat down at her <i>escritoire</i> to make calculations.
Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions? She had
already allowed that her wardrobe would cost not less than
twenty-five thousand dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional
expense of properly dressing Carmen. But she now
saw that this amount was hopelessly inadequate. She therefore
increased the figure to seventy-five thousand. But that
took half of her income. Could she maintain her city home,
entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?
Clearly, not on that amount. No, her income would not suffice;
she would be obliged to draw on the principal until Carmen
could be married off to some millionaire, or until her own
father died. Oh? if he would only terminate his useless existence
soon!</p>
<p>But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient
must be devised at once. She thought of the Beaubien. That
obscure, retiring woman was annually making her millions.
A tip now and then from her, a word of advice regarding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page120' name='book3_page120'></a>120</span>
market, and her own limited income would expand accordingly.
She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a member
of Holy Saints. But on that day, and again, two months
later, when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic
citizen, the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated,
she had marked the woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone
in the rear of the great church. What had brought her there?
she wondered. She had shuddered as she thought the tall,
black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow falling athwart
her own foolish existence.</p>
<p>But there was no doubt of Carmen&rsquo;s hold on the strange,
tarnished woman. And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing
her pride, she again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard
to Carmen&rsquo;s forthcoming <i>d&eacute;but</i>; and then, very adroitly
and off-handedly, she brought up the subject of investments,
alleging that the added burden of the young girl now rendered
it necessary to increase the rate of interest which her securities
were yielding.</p>
<p>The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.
Not only did she point out to Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
how her modest income might be quadrupled, but she even
offered, in such a way as to make it utterly impossible for that
lady to take offense, to lend her whatever amount she might
need, at any time, to further Carmen&rsquo;s social conquest. And
during the conversation she announced that she herself was
acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames,
and was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming
power in world finance, Mr. Philip O. Ketchim.</p>
<p>Why, to be sure, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had heard of this
man! Was he not promoting a company in which her sister&rsquo;s
husband, and the girl herself, were interested? And if such
investments were good enough for a magnate of Ames&rsquo;s standing,
they certainly were good enough for her. She would see
Mr. Ketchim at once. Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before! She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own
interest in this new company, if necessary. That interest of
itself was worth a fortune.</p>
<p>Quite true. And if Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so
desired, the Beaubien would advance them whatever they might
need on that security alone. Or, she would take the personal
notes of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;For, you know, my dear,&rdquo;
she said sweetly, &ldquo;when your father passes away you are going
to be very well off, indeed, and I can afford to discount that
inevitable event somewhat, can I not?&rdquo; And she not only could,
but did.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page121' name='book3_page121'></a>121</span>
this self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned
the equivalent of a single day&rsquo;s food, launched the sweet, white-souled
girl of the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York
society with such <i>&eacute;clat</i> that the Sunday newspapers devoted
a whole page, profusely illustrated, to the gorgeous event and
dilated with much extravagance of expression upon the charms
of the little Inca princess, and upon the very important and
gratifying fact that the three hundred fashionable guests present
displayed jewels to the value of not less than ten million
dollars.</p>
<p>The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen&rsquo;s
rich voice was first made known to the <i>beau monde</i>.
The girl instantly swept her auditors from their feet. The
splendid pipe-organ, which Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly
installed for the occasion, became a thing inspired under her
deft touch. It seemed in that garish display of worldliness to
voice her soul&rsquo;s purity, its wonder, its astonishment, its lament
over the vacuities of this highest type of human society,
its ominous threats of thundered denunciation on the day when
her tongue should be loosed and the present mesmeric spell
broken&ndash;&ndash;for she was under a spell, even that of this new world
of tinsel and material veneer.</p>
<p>The decrepit old Mrs. Gannette wept on Carmen&rsquo;s shoulder,
and went home vowing that she would be a better woman and
cut out her night-cap of Scotch-and-soda. Others crowded
about the girl and showered their fulsome praise upon her.
But not so Mrs. Ames and her daughter Kathleen. They stared
at the lovely <i>d&eacute;butante</i> with wonder and chagrin written legibly
upon their bepowdered visages. And before the close of
the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.
For her own feeble light had been drowned in the powerful
radiance of the girl from Simit&iacute;. And from that moment the
assassination of the character of the little Inca princess was
decreed.</p>
<p>But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her
environment, that she might search its farthest nook and angle;
what with ceaseless efforts to check her almost momentary
impulse to cry out against the vulgar display of modernity and
the vicious inequity of privilege which she saw on every hand;
what with her purity of thought; her rare ideals and selfless
motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her passionate
desire to so live her &ldquo;message&rdquo; that all the world might see
and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God
and her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that
they were literally full of emptiness. After her <i>d&eacute;but</i>, event
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page122' name='book3_page122'></a>122</span>
followed event in the social life of the now thoroughly gay
metropolis, and the poor child found herself hustled home
from one function, only to change her attire and hurry again,
weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be whisked off to another
equally vapid. It seemed to the bewildered girl that she
would never learn what was <i>de rigueur</i>; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.
Her tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation
of her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes
were exquisite torture; and her corsets, which her French
maid drew until the poor girl gasped for air, seemed to her
the cruellest device ever fashioned by the vacuous, enslaved
human mind. Frequently she changed her clothing completely
three and four times a day to meet her social demands. Night
became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon. She
found no time for study; none even for reading. And conversation,
such as was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof,
was confined to insipid society happenings, with frequent
sprinklings of racy items anent divorce, scandal, murder, or
the debauch of manhood. From this she drew more and more
aloof and became daily quieter.</p>
<p>It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded
circle of society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour
with the Beaubien. But when she could, she would open the
reservoirs of her soul and give full vent to her pent-up emotions.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she would often exclaim, as she sat at the feet
of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music room, and
gazed into the crackling fire, &ldquo;how can they&ndash;&ndash;how can they!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and
murmur, &ldquo;Wait, dearie, wait.&rdquo; And the tired girl would sigh
and close her eyes and dream of the quiet of little Simit&iacute; and
of the dear ones there from whom she now heard no word,
and yet whom she might not seek, because of the war which
raged about her lowly birthplace.</p>
<p>The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.
Ames angrily admitted to herself that her own crown was in
gravest danger. The South American girl&ndash;&ndash;and because of her,
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her blas&eacute; sister&ndash;&ndash;had completely
captured New York&rsquo;s conspicuous circle. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained with a display
of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness of
critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand. The
newspapers were full of her and her charming ward. Surely,
if the girl&rsquo;s social prestige continued to soar, the Ames family
soon would be relegated to the social &ldquo;has-beens.&rdquo; And Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page123' name='book3_page123'></a>123</span>
Ames and her haughty daughter held many a serious conference
over their dubious prospects.</p>
<p>Ames himself chuckled. Night after night, when the Beaubien&rsquo;s
dinner guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss
the social war now in full progress, and to exchange with her
witty comments on the successes of the combatants. One night
he announced, &ldquo;Lafelle is in England; and when he returns he
is coming by way of the West Indies. I shall cable him to
stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a little matter
of business for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien smiled her comprehension. &ldquo;Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
has become nicely enmeshed in his net,&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;The altar to friend Jim is a beauty. Also, I hear that she is
going to finance Ketchim&rsquo;s mining company in Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Ames. &ldquo;I learned to-day that Ketchim&rsquo;s engineer,
Harris, has returned to the States. Couldn&rsquo;t get up the
Magdalena river, on account of the fighting. There will be
nothing doing there for a year yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; commented the Beaubien. Then abruptly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;By
the way, I now hold Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&rsquo;s notes to the
amount of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I want
you to buy them from me and be ready to turn the screws
when I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames roared with laughter. &ldquo;Shrewd girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
pinching her cheek. &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll take them off your hands
to-morrow. And by the way, I must meet this Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let her alone,&rdquo; said the Beaubien quickly in a low
voice.</p>
<p>Ames wondered vaguely what she meant.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles another avenue for her astonishing social
activities. With rare shrewdness she had contrived to outwit
Mrs. Ames and secure the center box in the &ldquo;golden horseshoe&rdquo;
at the Metropolitan. There, like a gaudy garden spider
in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night, with her
rapt <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> at her side, and sent her insolent challenge broadcast.
Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames
were ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers
and patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and
Board of Trade plungers, some under indictment, others under
the shadow of death, all under the mesmeric charm of gold.
In the box at her left sat the Ames family, with their newly
arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of Altern and her son.
Though inwardly boiling, Mrs. Ames was smiling and affable
when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of the
Hawley-Crowles box.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page124' name='book3_page124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So chawmed to meet you,&rdquo; murmured the heir of Altern,
a callow youth of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved
hand of Carmen. Then, as he adjusted his monocle and fixed
his jaded eyes upon the fresh young girl, &ldquo;Bah Jove!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young
man and Carmen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about you,&rdquo; he said genially,
in a heavy voice that harmonized well with his huge frame;
&ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t had an opportunity to get acquainted until to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking
steadily at her. The girl gazed up at him with her trustful
brown eyes alight, and a smile playing about her mouth.
&ldquo;My, but you are big!&rdquo; she na&iuml;vely exclaimed.</p>
<p>While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed
at her frank, often witty, remarks. But then a curious, eager
look came into his face, and he became quiet and reflective.
He seemed unable to take his eyes from her. And when the
girl gently drew her hand from his he laughed again, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I know something about Colombia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and speak
the language a bit. We&rsquo;ll have to get together often, so&rsquo;s I
can brush up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, apparently noticing Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her
sister for the first time&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Oh, so glad to see you both! Camorso&rsquo;s
in fine voice to-night, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until
she blushed under his close gaze and turned her head away.
Then he went back to his box. But throughout the evening,
whenever the girl looked in the direction of the Ames family,
she met the steady, piercing gaze of the man&rsquo;s keen gray eyes.
And they seemed to her like sharp steel points, cutting into
the portals of her soul.</p>
<p>Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the
box and studied the operas that were produced on the boards
before her wondering gaze. Always Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was
with her. And generally, too, the young heir of Altern was
there, occupying the chair next to the girl&ndash;&ndash;which was quite as
the solicitous Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had planned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw&ndash;&ndash;deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; the youth
ventured one evening, as he took his accustomed place close to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music is always beautiful,&rdquo; the girl responded. &ldquo;But
the play, like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest
side of human life. It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and
cruelty. Only for its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera
is generally such a depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder,
that it would not be permitted on the stage. A few years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page125' name='book3_page125'></a>125</span>
from now people will be horrified to remember that the preceding
generation reveled in such blood scenes&ndash;&ndash;just as we
now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests in ancient
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man regarded her uncertainly. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Carmen,&rdquo; he hazarded, &ldquo;we must be true to life, you know!&rdquo;
Having delivered himself of this oracular statement, the youth
adjusted his monocle and settled back as if he had given finality
to a weighty argument.</p>
<p>The girl looked at him pityingly. &ldquo;You voice the cant of
the modern writer, &lsquo;true lo life.&rsquo; True to the horrible, human
sense of life, that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and
is satisfied with it, I admit. True to the unreal, temporal
sense of existence, that is here to-day, and to-morrow has gone
out in the agony of self-imposed suffering and death. True
to that awful, false sense of life which we must put off if we
would ever rise into the consciousness of <i>real</i> life, I grant you.
But the production of these horrors on the stage, even in a
framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew
out a better existence. Are you the better for seeing an exhibition
of wanton murder on the stage, even though the participants
wondrously sing their words of vengeance and passion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;they serve as warnings; they show us the things
we ought not to do, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful
form, does he set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback,
in order that he may see what not to carve?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;And we who would transform the human sense of life into one
of freedom from evil, can we build a perfect structure with
such grewsome models as this before us? You don&rsquo;t see it
now,&rdquo; she sighed; &ldquo;you are in the world, and of it; and the
world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality. But the day is coming when our musicians and authors
will turn from such base material as this to nobler themes&ndash;&ndash;themes
which will excite our wonder and admiration, and
stimulate the desire for purity of thought and deed&ndash;&ndash;themes
that will be beacon lights, and true guides. You don&rsquo;t understand.
But you will, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to
this conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen,
sensing the futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon
the young man, turned to topics which he could discuss with
some degree of intelligence.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to
the Hawley-Crowles box. He brought a huge box of imported
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page126' name='book3_page126'></a>126</span>
candy and a gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented
to Carmen. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the
effulgent midday sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kathleen wants you, Reggy,&rdquo; Ames abruptly announced to
the young man, whose lips were molding into a pout. &ldquo;Little
gathering up at the house. Take my car.&rdquo; His huge bulk
loomed over the younger man like a mountain as he took him
by the shoulders and turned him toward the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wish to see the opera!&rdquo; protested the youth, with
a vain show of resistance.</p>
<p>Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced
the boy out of the box and into the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Uncle Wilton&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed curtly. Then he took the seat which his
evicted nephew had vacated, and bent over Carmen. With a
final hopeless survey of the situation, Reginald turned and descended
to the cloak room, muttering dire but futile threats
against his irresistible relative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, little girl!&rdquo; Ames&rsquo;s manner unconsciously assumed
an air of patronage. &ldquo;This is the first real opportunity I&rsquo;ve
had to talk with you. Tell me, what do you think of New
York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen smiled up at him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began uncertainly,
&ldquo;since I have thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed
to the cold, I have begun to make mental notes. Already
I have thousands of them. But they are not yet classified,
and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr. Ames. But
I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few months
I was here I was too cold to even think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;the change from the
tropics was somewhat abrupt. But, aside from the climate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like awaking from a deep sleep,&rdquo; answered Carmen
meditatively. &ldquo;In Simit&iacute; we dream our lives away. In New
York all is action; loud words; harsh commands; hurry; rush;
endeavor, terrible, materialistic endeavor! Every person I see
seems to be going somewhere. He may not know where he is
going&ndash;&ndash;but he is on the way. He may not know why he is
going&ndash;&ndash;but he must not be stopped. He has so few years to
live; and he must pile up money before he goes. He must own
an automobile; he must do certain things which his more fortunate
neighbor does, before his little flame of life goes out and
darkness falls upon him. I sometimes think that people here
are trying to get away from themselves, but they don&rsquo;t know
it. I think they come to the opera because they crave any sort
of diversion that will make them forget themselves for a few
moments, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page127' name='book3_page127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! well, I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; was Ames&rsquo;s meaningless reply, as
he sat regarding the girl curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who
at least pretended to understand her, &ldquo;the thing that now
strikes me most forcibly is the great confusion that prevails
here in everything, in your government, in your laws, in your
business, in your society, and, in particular, in your religion.
Why, in that you have hundreds of sects claiming a monopoly
of truth; you have hundreds of churches, hundreds of religious
or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing concepts of God&ndash;&ndash;but
you get nowhere! Why, it has come to such a pass that,
if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure
he would be evicted from his own Church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I guess that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; commented Ames, quite at
sea in such conversation. &ldquo;But we solid business men have
found that religious emotion never gets a man anywhere. It&rsquo;s
weakening. Makes a man effeminate, and utterly unfits him
for business. I wouldn&rsquo;t have a man in my employ who was a
religious enthusiast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jesus was a religious enthusiast,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if there ever was such a person,&rdquo; he answered
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Bible&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of
literature ever written,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;And the Church,
well, I regard it as the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the
human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that to apply to every church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fits them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied his face for a few moments. He returned her
glance as steadily. But their thoughts were running in widely
divergent channels. The conversational topic of the moment
had no interest whatsoever for the man. But this brilliant,
sparkling girl&ndash;&ndash;there was something in those dark eyes, that
soft voice, that brown hair&ndash;&ndash;by what anomaly did this beautiful
creature come out of desolate, mediaeval Simit&iacute;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames, you do not know what religion is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Well, and what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that which binds us to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he knew not the meaning of the word. Or&ndash;&ndash;wait&ndash;&ndash;did
he? His thought broke restraint and flew wildly back&ndash;&ndash;but he
caught it, and rudely forced it into its wonted channel. But,
did he love his fellow-men? Certainly not! What would that
profit him in dollars and cents? Did he love his wife? his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page128' name='book3_page128'></a>128</span>
children? The thought brought a cynical laugh to his lips.
Carmen looked up at him wonderingly. &ldquo;You will have to,
you know,&rdquo; she said quixotically.</p>
<p>Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his. He looked
down at it, so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it
with the huge, hairy bulk of his own. This little girl was
drawing him. He felt it, felt himself yielding. He was beginning
to look beyond the beautiful features, the rare grace
and charm of physical personality, which had at first attracted
only the baser qualities of his nature, and was seeing glimpses
of a spiritual something which lay back of all that&ndash;&ndash;infinitely
more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred, untouchable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr. Ames?&rdquo;
The thin voice of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear
like a shrill discord. Ames turned savagely upon her. Then
he quickly found himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he laughed harshly. &ldquo;But I shall be represented by
my family. And you?&rdquo; He looked at Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, taking
the query to herself. &ldquo;That is, if my French dressmaker does
not fail me. She is dreadfully exasperating! What will Mrs.
Ames wear, do you think?&rdquo; She arched her brows at him as
she propounded this innocent question.</p>
<p>Ames chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is this year,&rdquo; he
sagely replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s diamonds in the heels!&rdquo; He gave a
sententious nod of his head. &ldquo;I overheard Kathleen and her
mother discussing plans. And&ndash;&ndash;do you want to know next
season&rsquo;s innovation? By George! I&rsquo;m a regular spy.&rdquo; He
stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable deceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she
drew her chair closer. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One condition,&rdquo; replied Ames, holding up a thick finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Anything!&rdquo; returned the grasping woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming
ward,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; and I want you to know her better. That can
be arranged very easily. Now what&rsquo;s the innovation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colored wigs,&rdquo; said Ames, with a knowing look.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme
satisfaction. She would boldly anticipate next season at the
coming Charity Ball. Then, leaning over toward Ames, she
laid her fan upon his arm. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you manage to come and see
us some time, my sister and Carmen? Any time,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;Just call me up a little in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page129' name='book3_page129'></a>129</span>
attention again to the stage. Ames rose and bowed his departure.
A business associate in a distant box had beckoned
him. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles dismissed him reluctantly; then
turned her wandering attention to the play.</p>
<p>But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated
by the puppet-show before her. The tenor shrieked out
his tender passion, and the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate
arms with languishing sighs. Carmen heeded not their
stage amours. She saw in the glare before her the care-lined
face of the priest of Simit&iacute;; she saw the grim features and
set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he led her
through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita&rsquo;s blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart
welled with a great love for them all; and she buried her face
in her hands and wept softly.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_15_1_1' id='CHAPTER_15_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, my little princess, wait,&rdquo; the Beaubien had said,
when Carmen, her eyes flowing and her lips quivering,
had again thrown herself into that strange woman&rsquo;s
arms and poured out her heart&rsquo;s surcease. &ldquo;It will not be
long now. I think I see the clouds forming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go back to Simit&iacute;, to Padre Jos&egrave;, to my home,&rdquo;
wailed the girl. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the ways and the thoughts
of these people. They don&rsquo;t know God&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t know what
love is&ndash;&ndash;they don&rsquo;t know anything but money, and clothes, and
sin, and death. When I am with them I gasp, I choke&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest, I understand,&rdquo; murmured the woman softly,
as she stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.
&ldquo;It is social asphyxia. And many even of the &lsquo;four hundred&rsquo;
are suffering from the same disease; but they would die rather
than admit it. Poor, blind fools!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen
and the Beaubien together seem stranger, more inexplicable,
than to that lone woman herself. Yet it existed, irresistible.
And both acknowledged it, nor would have had it otherwise.
To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic confidante and a
wise counselor. The girl knew nothing of the woman&rsquo;s past
or present life. She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual&ndash;&ndash;the reality which she felt that
Jesus must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept
of humanity. And in doing this, who knows?&ndash;&ndash;she may
have transformed the sordid, soiled woman of the world into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page130' name='book3_page130'></a>130</span>
something more than a broken semblance of the image of God.
To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of love, of purity,
had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul into a
sense of life before unknown. If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl;
opened her slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined
her lonely arms daily closer about the radiant creature who
had come so unexpectedly into her empty, sinful life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, mother dear&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Beaubien had long since begged
Carmen always to address her thus when they were sharing
alone these hours of confidence&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;they will not listen to my
message! They laugh and jest about real things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, dearie. And yet you tell me that the Bible says
wise men laughed at the great teacher, Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! And his message&ndash;&ndash;oh, mother dearest, his message
would have helped them so, if they had only accepted it!
It would have changed their lives, healed their diseases, and
saved them from death. And my message&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;her lip quivered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;my
message is only his&ndash;&ndash;it is the message of love. But
they won&rsquo;t let me tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sweet, live it. They can not prevent that, can they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do live it. But&ndash;&ndash;I am so out of place among them. They
scoff at real things. They mock all that is noble. Their talk
is so coarse, so low and degraded. They have no culture.
They worship money. They don&rsquo;t know what miserable failures
they all are. And Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien&rsquo;s jaw set. &ldquo;The social cormorant!&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;she will not let me speak of God in her house. She told
me to keep my views to myself and never voice them to her
friends. And she says I must marry either a millionaire or a
foreign noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! And become a snobbish expatriate! Marry a
decadent count, and then shake the dust of this democratic
country from your feet forever! Go to London or Paris or
Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and speak of disgraceful,
boorish America in hushed whispers! The empty-headed
fool! She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I
received Jim Crowles into my house! And that I gave him
what little gloss he was able to take on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother dear&ndash;&ndash;I would leave them&ndash;&ndash;only, they need love,
oh, so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien strained her to her bosom. &ldquo;They need you,
dearie; they little realize how they need you! I, myself, did
not know until you came to me. There, I didn&rsquo;t mean to let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page131' name='book3_page131'></a>131</span>
those tears get away from me.&rdquo; She laughed softly as Carmen
looked up anxiously into her face. &ldquo;Now come,&rdquo; she went on
brightly, &ldquo;we must plan for the Charity Ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of pain swept over the girl&rsquo;s face. The Beaubien
bent and kissed her. &ldquo;Wait, dearie,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You will
not leave society voluntarily. Keep your light burning. They
can not extinguish it. They will light their own lamps at
yours&ndash;&ndash;or they will thrust you from their doors. And then,&rdquo;
she muttered, as her teeth snapped together, &ldquo;you will come to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity
Ball, the Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession,
with numberless receptions, formal parties, and nondescript
social junketings interspersed. During these fleeting
hours of splash and glitter Mrs. Hawley-Crowles trod the air
with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an expert aviator.
Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the wonderful
South American girl always at her right hand, the worldly
ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs. Ames had ever attempted,
and marched straight to the goal of social leadership,
almost without interference. She had apparently achieved
other successes, too, of the first importance. She had secured
the assistance of Ames himself in matters pertaining to her
finances; and the Beaubien was actively co&ouml;perating with her
in the social advancement of Carmen. It is true, she gasped
whenever her thought wandered to her notes which the Beaubien
held, notes which demanded every penny of her principal
as collateral. And she often meditated very soberly over the
large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simit&iacute; stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim,
now president of that flourishing but as yet non-productive
company. But then, one day, an idea occurred to her, and she
forthwith summoned Carmen into the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my dear,&rdquo; she said, after expounding to the girl
certain of her thoughts anent the famous mine, &ldquo;I do not want
Mr. Ketchim to have any claim upon you for the expense which
he incurred on account of your six months in the Elwin school.
That thought, as well as others relating to your complete protection,
makes it seem advisable that you transfer to me your
share in the mine, or in the Simit&iacute; company. See, I give you a
receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as part
payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants
here. It is merely formal, of course. And it keeps your share
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page132' name='book3_page132'></a>132</span>
still in our family, of which you are and always will be a
member; but yet removes all liability from you. Of course,
you know nothing about business matters, and so you must
trust me implicitly. Which I am sure you do, in view of
what I have done for you, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly
transferred her claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs. Hawley-Crowles.
Whereupon the good woman tenderly kissed the
innocent child, and clasped a string of rich pearls about the
slender, white neck. And Carmen later told the Beaubien,
who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames. But that
priest of finance only chuckled and exclaimed: &ldquo;Excellent,
my dear! Couldn&rsquo;t be better! By the way, I had a cable from
Lafelle this morning, from Cartagena. Oh, yes, everything&rsquo;s
all right. Good-bye.&rdquo; But the Beaubien hung up the receiver
with a presentiment that everything was far from right, despite
his bland assurance. And she regretted bitterly now
that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.</p>
<p>The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant
function of its kind ever held among a people who deny
the impossible. The newspapers had long vied with one another
in their advertisements and predictions; they afterward
strove mightily to outdo themselves in their vivid descriptions
of the gorgeous <i>f&ecirc;te</i>. The decorative effects far excelled anything
ever attempted in the name of &ldquo;practical&rdquo; charity. The
display of gowns had never before been even closely approximated.
The scintillations from jewels whose value mounted
into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric spark.
And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men,
and who are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to
parade their material vestments and divert their dispirited
mentalities under the guise of benefaction to a class for whom
they rarely hold a loving thought.</p>
<p>Again the subtle Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had planned and
executed a <i>coup</i>. Mrs. Ames had subscribed the munificent
sum of twenty-five thousand dollars to charity a week before
the ball. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had waited for this. Then
she gloated as she telephoned to the various newspaper offices
that her subscription would be fifty thousand. Did she give
a new note to the Beaubien for this amount? That she did&ndash;&ndash;and
she obtained the money on the condition that the little
Inca princess should lead the grand march. Of course, Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles knew that she must gracefully yield first place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page133' name='book3_page133'></a>133</span>
to the South American girl; and yet she contrived to score a
triumph in apparent defeat. For, stung beyond endurance,
Mrs. Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the last moment
refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a season
unusually exacting. The wily Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had previously
secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner
for Carmen&ndash;&ndash;and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames
himself, who, learning that his wife and daughter would not
attend, abruptly announced that he himself would lead the
march with Carmen.</p>
<p>Why not? Was it not quite proper that the city&rsquo;s leading
man of finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter,
and with their full and gratuitous permission&ndash;&ndash;nay, at their
urgent request, so it was told&ndash;&ndash;lead with this fair young damsel,
this tropical flower, who, as rumor had it, was doubtless
a descendant of the royal dwellers in ancient Cuzco?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite proper, <i>O tempora, O mores</i>!&rdquo; murmured one Amos
A. Hitt, erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman
of leisure, as he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable
Weltmore apartments and exhaled a long stream of tobacco
smoke through his wide nostrils. &ldquo;And, if I can procure a
ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of witnessing this sacred
spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of charity,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned
of his intention&ndash;&ndash;though she said nothing to Carmen. Ames
had yielded to her previously expressed wish that he refrain
from calling at the Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to
force his attentions upon the young girl. But in this matter
he remained characteristically obdurate. And thereby a little
rift was started. For the angry Beaubien, striving to shield
the innocent girl, had vented her abundant wrath upon the
affable Ames, and had concluded her denunciation with a hint
of possible exposure of certain dark facts of which she was
sole custodian. Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously kissed
her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.
And Carmen went to the Ball.</p>
<p>Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the
crashing notes of the great band. The loud hum of voices
ceased, and all eyes turned to the leaders of the grand march,
as they stepped forth at one end of the great auditorium. Then
an involuntary murmur arose from the multitude&ndash;&ndash;a murmur
of admiration, of astonishment, of envy. The gigantic form of
Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of potential
force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental. His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page134' name='book3_page134'></a>134</span>
of comment, critical or commendatory. The smile which flitted
about his strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution
as the gentle uplifting of a tiger&rsquo;s paw&ndash;&ndash;behind it lay all that
was humanly terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense,
fascinating. His thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray,
lay about his great head like a lion&rsquo;s mane. He raised a hand
and gently pushed it back over the lofty brow. Then he bent
and offered an arm to the slender wisp of a girl at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd.
&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Hitt,&rdquo; replied the friend addressed. &ldquo;But
they say she belongs to the Inca race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort
seemed like a slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent,
intangible, gliding softly along with a huge, black
shadow. She was simply clad, all in white. About her neck
hung a string of pearls, and at her waist she wore the rare
orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon. But no one
saw her dress. No one marked the pure simplicity of her
attire. The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment
evoked no comment. The multitude saw but her wonderful
face; her big eyes, uplifted in trustful innocence to the
massive form at her side; her rich brown hair, which glittered
like string-gold in the strong light that fell in torrents upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitt, she isn&rsquo;t human! There&rsquo;s a nimbus about her head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could almost believe it,&rdquo; whispered that gentleman,
straining his long neck as she passed before him. &ldquo;God! has
she fallen into Ames&rsquo;s net?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and
who longed for no further taste of heaven than this stupendous
triumph which she had won for herself and the girl. Her
heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into a marvelous costume
of gold brocade. A double ballet ruffle of stiff white tulle
encircled it about the hips as a drapery. The bodice was of
heavy gold net. A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate
shade of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the
waist in a large rose bow, ambassadorial style. A double necklace
of diamonds, one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and
the other an alternation of emeralds and diamonds, encircled
her short, thick neck. A diamond coronet fitted well around
her wonderful amber-colored wig&ndash;&ndash;for, true to her determination,
she had anticipated the now <i>pass&eacute;e</i> Mrs. Ames and had
boldly launched the innovation of colored wigs among the
smart set. An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled
from her thick wrist. And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page135' name='book3_page135'></a>135</span>
height, the gaping people caught the glitter of a row
of diamonds in each high, gilded heel.</p>
<p>At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin
body curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously
upon the mass of common clay about him. &ldquo;Aw,
beastly crush, ye know,&rdquo; he murmured from time to time to
the unhearing dame at his right. And then, as she replied not,
he fell to wondering if she fully realized who he was.</p>
<p>Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant
swept. The big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy
harmony. In the distant corridors great illuminated fountains
softly plashed. At the tables beyond, sedulous, touting waiters
were hurriedly extracting corks from frosted bottle necks.
The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and glittered in rainbow
tints. The revelers waxed increasingly merry and care-free
as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy. Still further beyond, the massive oak
doors, with their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night
and the bitter blasts of winter. And they shut out, too, another,
but none the less unreal, externalization of the mortal thought
which has found expression in a social system &ldquo;too wicked for
a smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, no&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d get arrested! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors
clutched her wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.
Her teeth chattered as she stood shivering in the chill wind.
Then she hurried away.</p>
<p>At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept
her off her feet. A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been
waiting in an alley, ran out and seized her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jude, ain&rsquo;t ye goin&rsquo; in? Git arrested&ndash;&ndash;ye&rsquo;d spend the
night in a warm cell, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n our bunk, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to French Lucy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the woman whispered
hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead beat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Ye&rsquo;ve lost yer looks, Jude, an&rsquo; ol&rsquo; Lucy ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo;
to take ye in. We gotta snipe somepin quick&ndash;&ndash;or starve!
Look, we&rsquo;ll go down to Mike&rsquo;s place, an&rsquo; then come back here
when it&rsquo;s out, and ye kin pinch a string, or somepin, eh? Gawd,
it&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman glanced back at the lights. For a moment she
stood listening to the music from within. A sob shook her,
and she began to cough violently. The man took her arm, not
unkindly; and together they moved away into the night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Well, little girl, at last we are alone. Now we can exchange
confidences.&rdquo; It was Ames talking. He had, late in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page136' name='book3_page136'></a>136</span>
the evening, secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms,
and thither had led Carmen. &ldquo;What do you think of it all?
Quite a show, eh? Ever see anything like this in Simit&iacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked up at him. She thought him wonderfully
handsome. She was glad to get away for a moment from the
crowd, from the confusion, and from the unwelcome attentions
of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke of Altern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally made answer, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there were
such things in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames laughed pleasantly. How refreshing was this ingenuous
girl! And what a discovery for him! A new toy&ndash;&ndash;one
that would last a long time. But he must be careful of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on genially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager there&rsquo;s millions of
dollars&rsquo; worth of jewelry here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Carmen. &ldquo;And are the people going to sell it
and give the money to the poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell it! Ha! ha! Well, I should say not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;this is a&ndash;&ndash;a charity&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Quite so. No, it&rsquo;s the money derived from the
sale of tickets that goes to the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;aren&rsquo;t you interested in the poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; he hastened to assure her, in his
easy casual tone.</p>
<p>For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied
her, speculating eagerly on her next remark. Then it came
abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think
you people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary. Why don&rsquo;t you do away with poverty altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do away with it? Well, that&rsquo;s quite impossible, you know.
&lsquo;The poor ye have always with you&rsquo;, eh? You see, I know my
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw him a glance of astonishment. He was mocking
her! She was deeply serious, for charity to her meant love,
and love was all in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally replied, shaking her head, &ldquo;you do <i>not</i>
know your Bible. It is the poor thought that you have always
with you, the thought of separation from good. And that
thought becomes manifested outwardly in what is called
poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page137' name='book3_page137'></a>137</span>
the poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any
separation from God, who is infinite good?&rdquo; she continued earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don&rsquo;t know anything about
God. As for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.
Poverty, like death, is inevitable, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Neither is inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he returned brightly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s good news! Then
there is no such thing as &lsquo;the survival of the fittest,&rsquo; and the
weak needn&rsquo;t necessarily sink, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked him squarely in the eyes. &ldquo;Do you consider, Mr.
Ames, that you have survived as one of the fittest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, now&ndash;&ndash;what would you say about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say decidedly no,&rdquo; was the blunt reply.</p>
<p>A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip. People
did not generally talk thus to him. And yet&ndash;&ndash;this wisp of a
girl! Pshaw! She was very amusing. And, heavens above!
how beautiful, as she sat there beside him, her head erect, and
her face delicately flushed. He reached over and took her hand.
Instantly she drew it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the kind,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;who give money to the
poor, and then take it away from them again. All the money
which these rich people here to-night are giving to charity has
been wrested from the poor. And you give only a part of it
back to them, at that. This Ball is just a show, a show of
dress and jewels. Why, it only sets an example which makes
others unhappy, envious, and discontented. Don&rsquo;t you see
that? You ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear little girl,&rdquo; he said in a patronizing tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you think you are assuming a great deal? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not
half so bad as you paint me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen smiled. &ldquo;Well, the money you give away has got
to come from some source, hasn&rsquo;t it? And you manipulate the
stock market and put through wheat corners and all that, and
catch the poor people and take their money from them! Charity
is love. But your idea of charity makes me pity you. Up
here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by stifling
competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and legalized
theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university, and so
atone for his crimes. That is called charity. Oh, I know a lot
about such things! I&rsquo;ve been studying and thinking a great
deal since I came to the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come with a mission?&rdquo; he bantered. And there
was a touch of aspersion in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come with a message,&rdquo; she replied eagerly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page138' name='book3_page138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;let me warn and advise you: don&rsquo;t
join the ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers
with messages do. We&rsquo;ve plenty of &rsquo;em now. I can tear down
as easily as you or anybody else. But to build something better
is entirely another matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames, I&rsquo;ve got something better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; His tone spoke incredulous irony. &ldquo;Well, what is
it, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, eh? Well, perhaps that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said, bending toward
her and again attempting to take her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she said, drawing back quickly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know
what love is, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he whispered softly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really believe I do. Will
you teach me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; she said brightly. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to
live it. And you&rsquo;ll have to do just as I tell you,&rdquo; holding up an
admonitory finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m yours to command, little woman,&rdquo; he returned in mock
seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she began very softly, &ldquo;you must first learn that
love is just as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in
algebra. Do you know what that is? And you must apply it
just as you would apply any principle, to everything. And, oh,
it is important!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sweet little thing,&rdquo; he murmured absently, gazing
down into her glowing face. &ldquo;Who taught you such stuff?
Where did you learn it? I wonder&ndash;&ndash;I wonder if you really are
a daughter of the Incas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned back and laughed heartily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
am a princess. Of course! Don&rsquo;t I look like one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like&ndash;&ndash;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;pshaw!&rdquo; he passed his hand
across his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, you certainly are a princess. And&ndash;&ndash;do
you know?&ndash;&ndash;I wish I might be your prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you couldn&rsquo;t! Padre Jos&egrave; has that honor.&rdquo; But then
her bright smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the
long corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; demanded Ames savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him a
challenge to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she murmured gently, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s way down
in Simit&iacute;. And, oh, he was so good to me! He made me leave
that country on account of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man started slightly. This innocent girl little knew
that one of the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there
beside her. Then a new thought flashed into his brain. &ldquo;What
is the full name of this priest?&rdquo; he suddenly asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page139' name='book3_page139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&egrave;&ndash;&ndash;Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n,&rdquo; she whispered reverently.</p>
<p>Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n&ndash;&ndash;of Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;whom Wenceslas had made the
scapegoat of the revolution! Why, yes, that was the man!
And who, according to a recent report from Wenceslas, had
been arrested and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;where did you say this&ndash;&ndash;this Jos&egrave; was, little girl?&rdquo;
he asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Simit&iacute;,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He is working out his problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes shifted quickly from hers. But he could not hold
them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know, he never was a priest at heart. But,
though he saw the truth, in part, he was not able to prove it
enough to set himself free; and so when I came away he stayed
behind to work out his problem. And he will work it all out,&rdquo;
she mused abstractedly, looking off into the distance; &ldquo;he will
work it all out and come&ndash;&ndash;to me. I am&ndash;&ndash;I am working with
him, now&ndash;&ndash;and for him. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her voice dropped to a
whisper, &ldquo;I love him, oh, so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s steely eyes narrowed. His mouth opened; then
shut again with a sharp snap. That beautiful creature now
belonged to him, and to none other! Were there other claimants,
he would crush them without mercy! As for this apostate
priest, Jos&egrave;&ndash;&ndash;humph! if he still lived he should rot the rest of
his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!</p>
<p>Carmen looked up. &ldquo;When he comes to me,&rdquo; she said
softly, &ldquo;we are going to give ourselves to the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames appeared not to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;perhaps&ndash;&ndash;perhaps, by that time, you will be&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; snapped the man, irritated by the return of her
thought to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different,&rdquo; finished the girl gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Different, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Perhaps by that time you will&ndash;&ndash;you will love everybody,&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;Perhaps you won&rsquo;t go on piling up
big mountains of money that you can&rsquo;t use, and that you won&rsquo;t
let anybody else use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames frowned upon her. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on
love. Your empire, you know, is human business. But you
will find that such empires crumble and fall. And yours will,
like all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to
bear her down by his tremendous personality, &ldquo;you young and
inexperienced reformers might learn a few things, too, if your
prejudices could be surmounted. Has it ever occurred to you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page140' name='book3_page140'></a>140</span>
that we men of business think not so much about accumulating
money as about achieving success? Do you suppose you
could understand that money-making is but a side issue with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Achieving success!&rdquo; she echoed, looking wonderingly at
him. &ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;are you&ndash;&ndash;a success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to reply. Then he checked himself. A flush
stole across his face. Then his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, &ldquo;I suppose
you are&ndash;&ndash;a tremendous worldly success. And this Ball&ndash;&ndash;it is
a splendid success, too. Thousands of dollars will be raised for
the poor. And then, next year, the same thing will have to be
done again. Your charities cost you hundreds of millions every
year up here. And, meantime, you rich men will go right on
making more money at the expense of your fellow-men&ndash;&ndash;and
you will give a little of it to the poor when the next Charity
Ball comes around. It&rsquo;s like a circle, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said, smiling
queerly up at him. &ldquo;It has no end, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet
the girl with the lance of frivolity. &ldquo;Yes, I guess that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;But of course you will admit that the world is slowly
getting better, and that world-progress must of necessity be
gradual. We can&rsquo;t reform all in a minute, can we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how fast you might reform
if you really, sincerely tried. But I think it would be
very fast. And if you, a great, big, powerful man, with the
most wonderful opportunities in the world, should really try
to be a success, why&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d make very rapid
progress, and help others like you by setting such a great example.
For you are a wonderful man&ndash;&ndash;you really are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames looked at her long and quizzically. What did the girl
mean? Then he took her hand, this time without resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, little girl&ndash;&ndash;although I know there can be no doubt
of it&ndash;&ndash;are you a success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her luminous eyes to his. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied
simply.</p>
<p>He let fall her hand in astonishment. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he ejaculated,
&ldquo;would you mind telling me just why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his
sagging heartstrings suddenly taut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;I strive every moment to &lsquo;acquire
that mind which was in Christ Jesus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence fell upon them. From amusement to wonder, to
irritation, to anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation
to something akin to reverent awe had been the swift
course of the man&rsquo;s emotions as he sat in this secluded nook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page141' name='book3_page141'></a>141</span>
beside this strange girl. The poisoned arrows of his worldly
thought had broken one by one against the shield of her protecting
faith. His badinage had returned to confound himself.
The desire to possess had utterly fled before the conviction that
such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside
him had drawn closer&ndash;&ndash;that it was pressing against him&ndash;&ndash;that
a little hand had stolen gently into his&ndash;&ndash;and that a soft
voice, soft as the summer winds that sigh among the roses, was
floating to his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.
It is to know that through him the great Christ-principle worked
and did those things which the world will not accept, because it
thinks them miracles. It is to know that God is love, and to
act that knowledge. It is to know that love is the Christ-principle,
and that it will destroy every error, every discord, everything
that is unlike itself. It is to yield your present false
sense of happiness and good to the true sense of God as infinite
good. It is to bring every thought into captivity to this
Christ-principle, love. It is to stop looking at evil as a reality.
It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade away before the
wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there isn&rsquo;t
anything apart from Him. Won&rsquo;t you try it? You will have
to, some day. I have tried it. I know it&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve proved it.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.
Then the man suffered himself to be led silently back to the
ball room again. And when he had recovered and restored his
worldly self, the bright little image was no longer at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand here, Jude, an&rsquo; when they begins to come out to their
gasoline carts grab anything ye can, an&rsquo; git. I&rsquo;ll work over by
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man
slouched back against the wall close to the exit from which the
revelers would soon emerge. A distant clock over a jeweler&rsquo;s
window chimed the hour of four. A moment later the door
opened, and a lackey came out and loudly called the number of
the Hawley-Crowles car. That ecstatically happy woman, with
Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern, appeared
behind him in the flood of light.</p>
<p>As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom
the man had called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full
at Carmen. But the girl had seen her coming, and she met her
with outstretched arm. The glare from the open door fell full
upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jude!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page142' name='book3_page142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the little kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to flee. Carmen held her. With a quick movement
the girl tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust
it into Jude&rsquo;s hand. The latter turned swiftly and darted into
the blackness of the street. Then Carmen hurriedly entered
the car, followed by her stupefied companions. It had all been
done in a moment of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, when she had
recovered her composure sufficiently to speak. &ldquo;What does this
mean? What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carmen replied not. And the Duke of Altern rubbed
his weak eyes and tried hard to think.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_16_1_1' id='CHAPTER_16_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>
</div>
<p>Before Mrs. Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning
the east was red with the winter sun. &ldquo;The loss of the
pearls is bad enough,&rdquo; she exclaimed in conclusion, glowering
over the young girl who sat before her, &ldquo;for I paid a good
three thousand for the string! But, in addition, to scandalize
me before the world&ndash;&ndash;oh, how could you? And this unspeakable
Jude&ndash;&ndash;and that awful house&ndash;&ndash;heavens, girl! Who would
believe your story if it should get out?&rdquo; The worried woman&rsquo;s
face was bathed in cold perspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;she saved me from&ndash;&ndash;from that place,&rdquo; protested the
harassed Carmen. &ldquo;She was poor and cold&ndash;&ndash;I could see that.
Why should I have things that I don&rsquo;t need when others are
starving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair. Her
sister, Mrs. Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold
eyes throughout the stormy interview following their return
from the ball, now offered a suggestion. &ldquo;The thing to do is to
telephone immediately to all the newspapers, and say that her
beads were stolen last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they weren&rsquo;t stolen,&rdquo; asserted the girl. &ldquo;I gave them
to her&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your room!&rdquo; commanded Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, at
the limit of her endurance. &ldquo;And never, under any circumstances,
speak of this affair to any one&ndash;&ndash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon
the gilded wig of the dynamic Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, had been
given a jolt that set it tottering.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was very clear to Mrs. J. Wilton Ames after the Charity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page143' name='book3_page143'></a>143</span>
Ball that she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with
the most relentless of enemies. Nothing short of the miraculous
could now dethrone the detested Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her
beautiful, mysterious ward. She dolefully acknowledged to
herself and to the sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep,
that she had let her foot slip, and that her own husband&rsquo;s conduct
in leading the grand march with Carmen bade fair to give
the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to a social prestige which for many weeks
had been decidedly on the wane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, we&rsquo;ll have to think up some new stunts,&rdquo; said the
dejected Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball.
&ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ve even broken into the front page of the newspapers
with a fake jewelry theft! Look, they pretend that the
little minx was robbed of her string of pearls last night on
leaving the hall. I call that pretty cheap notoriety!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ames&rsquo;s lip curled in disdain as she read the news
item. &ldquo;An Inca princess, indeed! Nobody knows who she is,
nor what! Why doesn&rsquo;t somebody take the trouble to investigate
her? They&rsquo;d probably find her an outcast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t papa look her up?&rdquo; suggested Kathleen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ames did not reply. She had no wish to discuss her
husband, after the affair of the previous evening. And, even
in disregard of that, she would not have gone to him with the
matter. For she and her consort, though living under the
same roof, nevertheless saw each other but seldom. At times
they met in the household elevator; and for the sake of appearances
they managed to dine together with Kathleen in a
strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which
times no mention was ever made of the son who had been
driven from the parental roof. There were no exchanges of
confidences or affection, and Mrs. Ames knew but little of the
working of his mentality. She was wholly under the dominance
of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to his mode of
existence. He used her, as he did countless others, to buttress
a certain side of his very complex life. As for assistance in
determining Carmen&rsquo;s status, there was none to be obtained
from him, strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already
shown himself to be. Indeed, she might be grateful if
the attachment did not lead to far unhappier consequences!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new,&rdquo;
she replied irrelevantly to Kathleen&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;He has in
tow a Persian dervish, who sticks knives through his mouth,
and drinks melted lead, and bites red-hot pokers, and a lot of
such things. Larry says he&rsquo;s the most wonderful he&rsquo;s ever
seen, and I&rsquo;m going to have him and a real Hindu <i>swami</i> for
next Wednesday evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page144' name='book3_page144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>New York&rsquo;s conspicuous set indeed would have languished
often but for the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers,
who devised new diversions and stimulating mental condiments
for the jaded brains of that gilded cult. His table ballets, his
bizarre parlor circuses, his cunningly devised fads in which he
set forth his own inimitable antics, won him the motley and
the cap and bells of this tinseled court, and forced him well
out into the glare of publicity, which was what he so much
desired.</p>
<p>And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid
anarchist who toils by candle-light over his crude bombs. For
by it he taught the great mass of citizenship who still retained
their simple ideals of reason and respect that there existed a
social caste, worshipers of the golden calf, to whom the simple,
humdrum virtues were quite unendurable, and who, utterly
devoid of conscience, would quaff champagne and dance on the
raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men with glee, if thereby
their jaded appetites for novelty and entertainment might be
for the moment appeased.</p>
<p>And so Larry Beers brought his <i>swami</i> and dervish to the
Ames mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised
in the newspapers the following day. And he caused the eyes
of Carmen to bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as
she gazed. And he caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
to stand a bit closer to the perpendicular, while she
sat devising schemes to cast a shade over this clumsy entertainment.</p>
<p>The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
still running true to form, retorted with a superb
imitation of the French <i>Bal de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>, once so notable under
the Empire. The Beaubien had furnished the inspiring idea&ndash;&ndash;and
the hard cash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why I do it?&rdquo; that woman had meditated. &ldquo;Why
do I continue to lend her money and take her notes? I wanted
to ruin her, at first. I don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t seem to feel that way
now. Is it because of Carmen? Or is it because I hate that
Ames woman so? I wonder if I do still hate her? At any rate
I&rsquo;m glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from her place.
It&rsquo;s worth all I&rsquo;ve spent, even if I burn the notes I hold against
Jim Crowles&rsquo;s widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought
her bed, she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating,
wondering. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Carmen!&rdquo; she would always conclude. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Carmen. She&rsquo;s making me over again. I&rsquo;m not the same
woman I was when she came into my life. Oh, God bless her&ndash;&ndash;if
there is a God!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page145' name='book3_page145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>The mock <i>Bal de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i> was a magnificent <i>f&ecirc;te</i>. All the
members of the smart set were present, and many appeared in
costumes representing flowers, birds, and vegetables. Carmen
went as a white rose; and her great natural beauty, set off by
an exquisite costume, made her the fairest flower of the whole
garden. The Duke of Altern, costumed as a long carrot, fawned
in her wake throughout the evening. The tubbily girthy Gannette,
dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every step
as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments
upon the graceful creature. Kathleen Ames appeared as a
bluebird; and she would have picked the fair white rose to
pieces if she could, so wildly jealous did she become at the
sight of Carmen&rsquo;s further triumph.</p>
<p>About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door
at the end of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight
was turned full upon it. The orchestra burst into the wailing
dead march from <i>Saul</i>, and out through the glare of light
stalked the giant form of J. Wilton Ames, gowned in dead black
to represent a King Vulture, and with a blood-red fez surmounting
his cruel mask. As he stepped out upon the platform
which had been constructed to represent the famous
bridge in &ldquo;<i>Sumurun</i>,&rdquo; and strode toward the main floor, a
murmur involuntarily rose from the assemblage. It was a
murmur of awe, of horror, of fear. The &ldquo;<i>monstrum horrendum</i>&rdquo;
of Poe was descending upon them in the garb which alone
could fully typify the character of the man! When he reached
the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous
financial obligations to Ames.</p>
<p>Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle.
&ldquo;I want to go,&rdquo; she said to the petrified Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
who had known nothing of this feature of the program.</p>
<p>Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black
vulture stalked. The revelers fell away from him on either
side as he approached. Carmen turned again and watched him
come. Her face was ashen. &ldquo;God is everywhere,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Then her anxious look faded. A light came into her eyes,
and a smile wreathed her mouth. And when Ames reached her
and extended his huge, black wings again, she walked straight
into them with a look of joy upon her beautiful face. Then the
wings closed and completely hid the fair, white form from the
gaping crowd.</p>
<p>For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page146' name='book3_page146'></a>146</span>
hall. Then the orchestra crashed, the vulture&rsquo;s wings slowly
opened, and the girl, who would have gone to the stake with
the same incomprehensible smile, stepped out. The black
monster turned and strode silently, ominously, back to the end
of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared through the
door which opened at his approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home!&rdquo; said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring
wife. &ldquo;That looks bad to me! That girl&rsquo;s done for; and
Ames has taken this way to publicly announce the fact! My
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another astonished watcher in the audience that
evening. It was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back
from Europe by way of the West Indies. And after the episode
just related, he approached Carmen and Mrs. Hawley-Crowles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very clever, if startling, performance,&rdquo; he commented;
&ldquo;and with two superb actors, Mr. Ames and our little friend
here,&rdquo; bowing over Carmen&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>so</i> glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.
But, dear me! I haven&rsquo;t got my breath yet,&rdquo; panted the steaming
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. &ldquo;Do take us, Monsignor, to the
refectory. I feel faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was
relating vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of
news from Cartagena. &ldquo;No, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he said, in reply to
her anxious inquiries, &ldquo;I did not meet the persons you have
mentioned. And as for getting up the Magdalena river, it
would have been quite impossible. Dismiss from your mind all
thought of going down there now. Cartagena is tense with
apprehension. The inland country is seething. And the little
town of Simit&iacute; which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which
welled into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your entertainment, Madam,&rdquo; continued Lafelle, addressing
the now recovered Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, &ldquo;is superb, as have
been all of your social projects this winter, I learn. The
thought which you expressed to me some months ago regarding
Catholic activity in social matters certainly was well
founded. I perceive that our Protestant rivals have all but
retired from the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride. Carmen regarded
the churchman with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction
and comfort, since you united with the true Church?&rdquo; Lafelle
went on. &ldquo;Are you not at last at rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely
one of unalloyed relief.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page147' name='book3_page147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>Lafelle turned to Carmen. &ldquo;And our little friend here&ndash;&ndash;can
she still remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge
of her indebtedness to the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked blank. &ldquo;My indebtedness to the Church!&rdquo;
she repeated. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now Lafelle&rsquo;s turn to sigh, as he directed himself
again to Mrs. Hawley-Crowles. &ldquo;She does not see, Madam, that
it was by the ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her
present enviable social height.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;what&ndash;&ndash;what do you mean?&rdquo; stammered the bewildered
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I not come and explain it to her?&rdquo; said Lafelle. Then
he suddenly thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.
But he shrugged his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon
his features.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request. She
knew she was now too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and
that Lafelle&rsquo;s control over her was complete&ndash;&ndash;unless she dared
to face social and financial ruin. And under that thought she
paled and grew faint, for it raised the curtain upon chaos and
black night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?&rdquo;
continued the churchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely
audible voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation,
&ldquo;how, may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have
not seen her much of late, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strong and very liberal-minded woman,&rdquo; returned Lafelle
with emphasis. &ldquo;I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I
may express the hope that you are in no way influenced by
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes
ablaze, &ldquo;Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her
back into her chair. &ldquo;You misunderstand me, quite. Madam
Beaubien is a very dear friend of ours, and we greatly admire
her strength of character. She certainly does not require your
defense! Dear! dear! you quite startled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his
companions to lead them back to the hall. Delivering Carmen
into the charge of the eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle
remarked, as he took leave of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, &ldquo;I trust
you will permit me to talk with your beautiful ward to-morrow
afternoon&ndash;&ndash;alone.&rdquo; And when the lady interpreted the significance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page148' name='book3_page148'></a>148</span>
of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as she bowed her
acknowledgment of abject submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah Jove!&rdquo; ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen.
&ldquo;Ye know, I was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that
Uncle Wilton had you. Ye know, I think I&rsquo;m jealous of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow. His grotesque costume
made him appear still more ridiculous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen! It&rsquo;s a bally bore to
have a regular mountain like him always getting in the way;
and to-night I just made up my mind I wouldn&rsquo;t stand it any
longer, bah Jove! I say, come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly
toward the refreshment hall. Carmen went in silence. She
heard his murmur of gratification when his gaze lighted upon
the chairs and table which he had evidently arranged previously
in anticipation of this <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know,&rdquo; he finally began, after they were seated and he
had sat some minutes staring at the girl, &ldquo;ye know, you&rsquo;re
deucedly clevah, Miss Carmen! I told mother so to-day, and
this time she had to agree. And that about your being an Inca
princess&ndash;&ndash;ye know, I could see that from the very first day I
met you. Mighty romantic, and all that, don&rsquo;t ye know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes!&rdquo; replied the girl, her thought drifting back to
distant Simit&iacute;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all about that mine you own in South America&ndash;&ndash;and
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress&ndash;&ndash;and all that&ndash;&ndash;bah
Jove! It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s romantic, I tell you!&rdquo; His head continued
to nod emphasis to his thought long after he finished speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know,&rdquo; he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case
from a pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, &ldquo;a fellow
can always tell another who is&ndash;&ndash;well, who belongs to the
aristocracy. Mrs. Ames, ye know, said she had some suspicions
about you. But I could see right off that it was because she
was jealous. Mother and I knew what you were the minute we
clapped eyes on you. That&rsquo;s because we belong to the nobility,
ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smoked in silence for some moments. Carmen was far,
far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I&rsquo;m going to say it!&rdquo; he suddenly
blurted. &ldquo;Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont&rsquo;s filly;
but, bah Jove, I say, I&rsquo;m going to marry you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide
and staring. &ldquo;Marry me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re a princess,
ye know, and so you&rsquo;re in our class. I&rsquo;m not one of the kind
that hands out a title to the red-nosed daughter of any American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page149' name='book3_page149'></a>149</span>
pork packer just to get her money. Not me! The girl I
marry has got to be my equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured the astonished Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right for you to have money, of course. I won&rsquo;t
marry a pauper, even if she&rsquo;s a duchess. But you and I, Miss
Carmen, are just suited to each other&ndash;&ndash;wealth and nobility on
each side. I&rsquo;ve got thirty thousand good British acres in my
own right, bah Jove!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise. She
reflected a moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth
with the spirit of levity which his audacity merited. &ldquo;But,
Reginald,&rdquo; she said in mock seriousness, &ldquo;though your father
was a duke, how about your mother? Was she not just an
ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs. J. Wilton Ames?
Where&rsquo;s the aristocracy there? Now on my side&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; cried the boy petulantly, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
see that, by marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?
Bah Jove, you don&rsquo;t understand! Were your parents both
noble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they were!&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;They were both children
of a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; he whispered, leaning far over the table
toward her. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve simply <i>got</i> to marry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested the girl, &ldquo;in my country people love those
whom they marry. I haven&rsquo;t heard a word of that from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was just getting round to
that. It was love that made me offer you my name and title!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? Love of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed musically. &ldquo;My dear Reginald, you don&rsquo;t love
me. It is yourself that you love. You are madly in love, it is
true; but it is with the young Duke of Altern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you can&rsquo;t talk to me that way, ye know!&rdquo; he
flared out. &ldquo;Bah Jove, I&rsquo;m offering to make you a duchess&ndash;&ndash;and
I love you, too, though you may not think it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you love me, Reginald,&rdquo; said Carmen in gentle
reply, now relinquishing her spirit of badinage; &ldquo;and I love
you. But I do not wish to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man started under the shock and stared at her
in utter lack of comprehension. Was it possible that this unknown
girl was refusing him, a duke? She must be mad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t get you, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, rising and holding out a hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
not talk about this any more. We must go back to the hall. I
do love you, Reginald, but not in the way that perhaps you
would like. I love the real <i>you</i>; not the vain, foolish, self-adoring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page150' name='book3_page150'></a>150</span>
human concept, called the Duke of Altern. And the
love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than if I married
you! Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Miss Carmen!&rdquo; He stood before her with mouth
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reginald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I expected we&rsquo;d be engaged&ndash;&ndash;I told mother&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Reginald, we are engaged. Engaged in handling
this little problem that has presented itself to you. Do you
see? And I will help you to solve it in the right way. For you
need help. Reginald dear, I didn&rsquo;t mean to treat your proposal
so lightly. I am sorry. There, give me your hand. We&rsquo;re just
awfully good friends, aren&rsquo;t we? And I do love you, more than
you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul
of the very conservative Mrs. Gannette, whose husband, suffering
from a sense of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a
King Vulture, had some moments before summoned his car and
driven to his favorite club to flood his apprehensions with Scotch
high-balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, little sly-boots!&rdquo; piped Mrs. Gannette, shaking a finger
at Carmen. &ldquo;I saw you with Reginald just now. I&rsquo;m awfully
wise about such things. Tell me, dear, when shall we be able
to call you the Duchess of Altern? You lucky girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to
the banal boredom of this blustering dame&rsquo;s society gabble.
Mrs. Gannette hooked her arm into the girl&rsquo;s and led her to a
divan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great affair, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she panted, settling her
round, unshapely form out over the seat. &ldquo;Dear me! I did
intend to come in costume. Was coming as a tomato. Ha! ha!
Thought that was better adapted to my shape. But when I got
the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn&rsquo;t get through
the door! And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came
looking like that he&rsquo;d get a divorce.&rdquo; The corpulent dame
shook and wheezed with the expression of her abundant merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t his threat that hindered
me, goodness knows! A divorce would be a relief, after living
forty years with him! Say, there goes young Doctor Worley.
Speaking of divorce, he&rsquo;s just got one. It all came round
through a joke. Billy Patterson dared him to exchange wives
with him one evening when they were having a little too much
gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the dare. Ha!
ha! The men swapped wives for two days. What do you think
of that! And this divorce was the result. But Billy took his
wife back. He thought it was just a good joke. Kate Worley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page151' name='book3_page151'></a>151</span>
gets an alimony of fifty thousand per. But the doctor can
stand it. Why, he has a practice of not less than two hundred
and fifty thousand a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supposed,&rdquo; murmured Carmen, &ldquo;that amount of money
is a measure of his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gannette. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s simply
in with the wealthy, that&rsquo;s all. Dear! dear! Do look at that
fright over there! It&rsquo;s Lizzie Wall. Now isn&rsquo;t she simply
hideous! Those diamonds are nothing but paste! The hussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the
hall, seated alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to meet her,&rdquo; she said, suddenly drawn by the
woman&rsquo;s mute appeal for sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; hastily interposed Mrs. Gannette. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
going to be dropped. Name&rsquo;s already on the black list. I don&rsquo;t
know what Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her
to-night! Her estate is being handled by Ames and Company,
and J. Wilton says there won&rsquo;t be much left when it&rsquo;s settled&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another
topic. &ldquo;There goes Miss Tottle. Look at her skirt&ndash;&ndash;flounced
at the knees, and full in the back so&rsquo;s to give a bustle effect.
My! I wish I could wear togs cut that way&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say, my dear,&rdquo; the garrulous old worldling prattled
on, &ldquo;that next season&rsquo;s styles will be very ultra. Butterfly idea,
I hear. Hats small and round, like the heads of butterflies.
Waists and jackets very full and quite loose in the back and
shoulders, so&rsquo;s to give the appearance of wings. Belts, but no
drawing in at the waist. Skirts plaited, plaits opening wide
at the knees and coming close together again at the ankle, so&rsquo;s
to look like the body of a butterfly. Then butterfly bows
sprinkled all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for breath. Then she drew a long sigh. &ldquo;Oh
dear,&rdquo; she lamented, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything if I had a decent shape!
I&rsquo;d like to wear those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer
things over silk tights. But, mercy me! I&rsquo;d look like a potato
busted wide open. Now you can wear those X-ray dresses all
right&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the
Dog Show. Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter
around the leg just below. How I&rsquo;d look! I have a leg like a
ham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying
the pale woman across the hall. She had resolved to meet her
just as soon as the loquacious Mrs. Gannette should seek another
victim. But that genial old gossip gave no present evidence
of a desire to change.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page152' name='book3_page152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad you&rsquo;re going to marry young Altern,&rdquo; she said,
again swerving the course of her conversation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a
fine old ruined castle somewhere in England, and seems to
have wads of money, though I hear that everything is mortgaged
to Ames. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Still, his bare title
is worth something to an American girl. Besides, you&rsquo;ve got
money. And you&rsquo;ll do a lot for his family. You know&ndash;&ndash;but
don&rsquo;t breathe a word of this!&ndash;&ndash;his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.
For a while Ames backed her, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do. His millions
couldn&rsquo;t buy her the court entr&eacute;e, and she just had to quit.
That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s over here now. The old Duke&ndash;&ndash;he was lots
older than she&ndash;&ndash;died a couple of years ago. Ran through everything
and drank himself to death. Before and since that happy
event the Duchess did everything under the heavens to get a
bid to court. She gave millions to charity and to entertainments.
She sacrificed everything. But, no sir! It wouldn&rsquo;t
do. She had no royal blood. But with you it will be different.
You&rsquo;re a princess, royal Inca, and such like. You qualify right
from the jump. So you see what you&rsquo;re expected to do for the
Altern crowd&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! dear!&rdquo; catching her breath and switching quickly
to another theme, &ldquo;have you heard about the Hairton scandal?
It&rsquo;s simply rich! You see, young Sidney Ames&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s patience had touched its limit. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged, holding out a hand. &ldquo;I do not wish to
hear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.
&ldquo;Why, my dear! what&rsquo;s the matter? The scandal&rsquo;s about
Ames&rsquo;s son, you know. The reason he doesn&rsquo;t go in society.
Just come to light. You see&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Gannette,&rdquo; Carmen looked up at her with a
beseeching smile. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t deliberately give me poison
to drink, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly not!&rdquo; blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after
thought that is deadly poisonous, don&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to harm me, I know,&rdquo; pleaded the girl.
&ldquo;But if you only understood mental laws you would know that
every thought entering one&rsquo;s mind tends to become manifested
in some way. Thoughts of disease, disaster, death, scandal&ndash;&ndash;all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page153' name='book3_page153'></a>153</span>
tend to become externalized in discordant ways, either on
the body, or in the environment. You don&rsquo;t want any such
things manifested to me, do you? But you might just as well
hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of
a grandee. Carmen seized her hand. &ldquo;I do not want to listen
to these unreal things which concern only the human mind,&rdquo;
she said earnestly. &ldquo;Nor should you, if you are truly aristocratic,
for aristocracy is of the thought. I am not going to
marry Reginald. A human title means nothing to me. But
one&rsquo;s thought&ndash;&ndash;that alone is one&rsquo;s claim to <i>real</i> aristocracy. I
know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to let you
poison me. Now I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly
mingled with the crowd on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little cat!&rdquo; exploded Mrs. Gannette, when she again
found herself. &ldquo;She has mortally insulted me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone,
who had been one of the objects of Mrs. Gannette&rsquo;s slighting
remarks. The woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching,
and a look of wonder came into her eyes. Carmen
held out a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Carmen Ariza,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;You are Miss Wall.
I want you to be my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman roused up and tried to appear composed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ride with me to-morrow?&rdquo; continued Carmen.
&ldquo;Then we can talk all we want to, with nobody to overhear.
Aren&rsquo;t you happy?&rdquo; she abruptly added, unable longer to withstand
the appeal which issued mutely from the lusterless eyes
before her.</p>
<p>The woman smiled wanly. &ldquo;Not so very,&rdquo; she replied
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am poverty-stricken,&rdquo; returned the woman sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will give you money,&rdquo; Carmen quickly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything but
money. That is why I am poverty-stricken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she added, brightening, &ldquo;now you have me! And will
you call me up, first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride
with me? I want you to, so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes grew moist. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I
will&ndash;&ndash;gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the small hours of the morning there were several heads
tossing in stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various
New York mansions. But Carmen&rsquo;s was not one of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>
</div>
<p>On the morning following Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&rsquo;s very successful
imitation of the <i>Bal de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>, Monsignor Lafelle
paid an early call to the Ames <i>sanctum</i>. And the latter
gentleman deemed the visit of sufficient importance to devote
a full hour to his caller. When the churchman rose to take
his leave he reiterated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you,
Mr. Ames, but on the conditions which I have named. But
Rome must be communicated with, and the substance of her
replies must be sent from Cartagena to you, and your letters
forwarded to her. That might take us into early summer. But
there is no likelihood that Mr. Ketchim&rsquo;s engineers will make
any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia. Mr.
Reed in still in California. Mr. Harris is in Denver, at his old
home, you tell me. So we need look for no immediate move
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite satisfactory, Lafelle,&rdquo; returned Ames genially. &ldquo;In
future, if I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.
Mr. Willett will hand you a check covering your traveling expenses
on my behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in
his chair and gave himself up to a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I
wonder,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;I wonder if the fellow has something up
his sleeve that he didn&rsquo;t show me? He acted suspiciously.
Perhaps he&rsquo;s getting a bit dangerous. He may know too much
already. I&rsquo;m going to drop him after this trap is sprung. He&rsquo;s
got Jim Crowles&rsquo;s widow all tied up, too. I wonder if he&ndash;&ndash;by
heaven! if he begins work on that girl I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.
It was Gannette. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted Ames, &ldquo;you say the girl
insulted your wife last evening? I don&rsquo;t believe she could&ndash;&ndash;Yes,
yes, I mean, I don&rsquo;t think she meant to&ndash;&ndash;certainly not,
no aspersion whatever intended&ndash;&ndash;What? the girl will have to
apologize?&ndash;&ndash;Well! well&ndash;&ndash;No, not in a thousand years!&ndash;&ndash;Yes,
I&rsquo;ll back her! And if your society isn&rsquo;t good enough for her&ndash;&ndash;and
I don&rsquo;t think it is&ndash;&ndash;why, I&rsquo;ll form a little coterie all by
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver with a slam. Then he angrily summoned
Hodson. &ldquo;I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette
now until I call them off,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I want you to
take personal charge of them. Dog his every move. I&rsquo;ll give
you some suggestions later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page155' name='book3_page155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>Hodson bowed and went out. Ames continued his meditations.
&ldquo;Lucile already has Gannette pretty well wound up in
his Venezuelan speculations&ndash;&ndash;and they are going to smash&ndash;&ndash;Lafelle
has fixed that. And I&rsquo;ve bought her notes against Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles for about a million&ndash;&ndash;which I have reinvested
for her in Colombia. Humph! She&rsquo;ll feed out of my hand
now! La Libertad is mine when the trap falls. So is C. and R.
And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way the Colombian revolution drags,&rdquo; he
mused. &ldquo;But certainly it can&rsquo;t last much longer. And then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts wandered off into devious channels. &ldquo;So
Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n is&ndash;&ndash;well! well! Things have taken an odd
turn. But&ndash;&ndash;where on earth did that girl come from? Lord!
she was beautiful last night. All religion, eh? Ha! ha! Well,
she&rsquo;s young. There&rsquo;s a lot of experience coming to her. And
then she&rsquo;ll drop a few of her pious notions. Lucile says&ndash;&ndash;but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and her
ward awaiting him when his car drove up at two that afternoon.
Carmen had not left the house during the morning, for
Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that a slight indisposition
would necessitate postponement of the contemplated ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; reflected Carmen, as she turned from the &rsquo;phone,
&ldquo;one who knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed,
for all good is ever present.&rdquo; And then she set about
preparing for the expected call of Monsignor Lafelle.</p>
<p>When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
graciously welcomed him, and then excused herself.
&ldquo;I will leave her with you, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said, indicating
Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a presence which she
greatly feared. Lafelle bowed, and then waved Carmen to a
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to-day, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he began easily, &ldquo;on
a mission of vastest importance as concerning your welfare. I
have been in Cartagena. I have talked with the acting-Bishop
there, who, it seems, is not wholly unacquainted with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Carmen eagerly, &ldquo;you know where Padre
Jos&egrave; is? And the others&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Lafelle. &ldquo;I regret to say I know nothing of
their present whereabouts. Leave them with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long since done that,&rdquo; said Carmen softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of yourself that I wish to speak,&rdquo; continued Lafelle.
&ldquo;I have come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page156' name='book3_page156'></a>156</span>
of the Church. Your great benefactress, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
has found peace with us. Will you longer delay taking
a step toward which you are by race, by national custom,
and by your Saviour admonished? I have come to invite you
to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of Rome.
You belong to us. A Catholic country gave you birth. Your
parents were Catholic. Your best friend, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
is one of us. Come,&rdquo; he said, extending his hands. &ldquo;We need
you. And you, my daughter, now need the Church,&rdquo; he added
with suggestive emphasis.</p>
<p>Carmen was not surprised. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had
hinted the probable mission of the churchman, and the girl
was prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Monsignor,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;But it is
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible?&rdquo; He arched his fine brows. &ldquo;My child, it is
quite necessary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Monsignor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your eternal salvation,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have my salvation, ever present. It is the Christ-principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in
the hope that they will open the door of heaven for you.
There is no salvation outside of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; said Carmen gently, &ldquo;such talk is very foolish.
Can you prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to
heaven? Have you any but a very mediaeval and material
concept of heaven? To me, heaven is right here. It is the
consciousness of good only, without a trace of materiality or
evil. And I enter into that consciousness by means of the
Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world. It is very
simple, is it not? And it makes all your pomp and ceremony,
and your penance and rites quite unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle eyed her narrowly. He had certain suspicions, but
he was not ready to voice them. Carmen went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, <i>so</i> much! I want
to see every one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all
do, and without any hindrance from others. And I ask but that
same privilege from every one, yourself included. Let me
work out my salvation as my Father has directed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle smiled paternally. &ldquo;I have no wish to hinder you,
child. On the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible
guidance of the Church. You are very young. We are very
old. Beginning nineteen centuries ago, when we were divinely
appointed custodian of the world&rsquo;s morals, our history has
been a glorious one. We have in that time changed a pagan
world into one that fears God and follows His Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page157' name='book3_page157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various
so-called Christian sects of the world have been persecuting
and slaying one another over their foolish beliefs, basing their
religious theories upon their interpretations of the Bible. Surely
that is not a glorious history!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my
child. The result which you have just cited proves conclusively
that the Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by
every one. That is perfectly patent to you, I see. Thus you
acknowledge the necessity of an infallible guide. That is to be
found only in the spiritual Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy
Head of the Church of Rome, the present Vicegerent of Christ
on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?
The only <i>real</i> Christians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose. &ldquo;Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.
We will take your car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;where are you going?&rdquo; he asked in amazement, as
he slowly got to his feet.</p>
<p>She stopped and faced him squarely. &ldquo;Jesus said: &lsquo;He that
believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.&rsquo; I am
going to take you over to the home of old Maggie, our cook&rsquo;s
mother. She is sick. You will heal her, for you are a true
follower of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;but, hasn&rsquo;t she a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he can&rsquo;t help her. Doctors are not infallible.
But you represent the Christ on earth. You should be able to
do the works which he did. You can change the wafer and
wine into the flesh and blood of Jesus. How much easier,
then, and vastly more practical, to cure a sick woman! Wait,
I will be back in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish
errand as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped again. &ldquo;If the woman were dying or dead, and
you were summoned, you would go, would you not? For she is
a Catholic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and
pray&ndash;&ndash;but it wouldn&rsquo;t make her well. And if she were dead,
you would say Masses for the repose of her soul. Monsignor,
did it never occur to you that the great works which you claim
to do are all done behind the veil of death? You can do but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page158' name='book3_page158'></a>158</span>
little for mankind here; but you pretend to do much after
they have passed beyond the grave. Is it quite fair to the poor
and ignorant, I ask, to work that way? Did it never strike
you as remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he
launched a great truth, immediately ratified it by some great
sign, some sign which the world now calls a miracle? The
Gospels are full of such instances, where he first taught, then
came down and immediately healed some one, thus at once
putting his teaching to the proof. Do you prove anything?
Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced for
ages, but what has it proved? Jesus taught practical Christianity.
You teach the so-called practical Christianity which
makes a reality of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals
and orphan asylums. If you did his works the people would
be so uplifted that these things would be wiped out. Your
Church has had nineteen hundred years in which to learn to
do the works which he did. Now come over to Maggie&rsquo;s with
me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and
that the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually the girl&rsquo;s voice waxed stronger while she delivered
this polemic. Slowly the churchman&rsquo;s face darkened, as he
moved backward and sank into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well,&rdquo; the girl continued,
smiling as she sat down again, &ldquo;I will apologize. But
you needed the scolding&ndash;&ndash;you know you did! And nearly all
who profess the name of Christ need the same. Monsignor, I
love you all, and every one, whether Catholic or Protestant, or
whatever his creed. But that does not blind my eyes to your
great need, and to your obstinate refusal to make any effort
to meet that need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cynical look came into the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;May I ask, Miss
Carmen, if you consider yourself a true follower and believer?&rdquo;
he said coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; she quickly replied, rising and facing him,
&ldquo;you hope by that adroit question to confound me. You mean,
do I heal the sick? Listen: when I was a child my purity of
thought was such that I knew no evil. I could not see it anywhere.
I could not see sickness or death as anything more
than unreal shadows. And that wonderful clearness of vision
and purity of thought made me a channel for the operation of
the Christ-principle, God himself. And thereby the sick were
healed in my little home town. Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jos&egrave;, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle
to keep the vision clear. They did not mean to, but he and my
dearest padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page159' name='book3_page159'></a>159</span>
a reality so constantly before me that the vision became obscured,
and the spirituality alloyed. The unreal forces of evil
seemed to concentrate upon me. I know why now, for the
greatest good always stirs up the greatest amount of evil&ndash;&ndash;the
highest truth always has the lowest lie as its opposite and
opponent. I see now, as never before, the unreality of evil. I
see now, as never before, the marvelous truth which Jesus
tried, oh, <i>so</i> hard, to impress upon the dull minds of his people,
the truth which you refuse to see. And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire &lsquo;that mind,&rsquo; that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him. My vision is becoming daily clearer.
I have been wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for. And
I shall heal, some day, as he did. I shall regain my former
spirituality, for it has never really been lost. But, Monsignor,
do not ask me to come into your Church and allow my brightening
vision to become blurred by your very inadequate concept
of God&ndash;&ndash;a God who is moved by the petitions of Saints
and Virgin and mortal men. No! no! Unless,&rdquo; she added,
brightening, &ldquo;you will let me teach your Church what I know.
Will you agree to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle did not answer. Then Carmen shook her head.
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;your Church requires absolute submission
to its age-worn authority. According to you, I have nothing
to give. Very well, if your Church can receive nothing from
me, and yet can give me nothing more than its impossible beliefs,
undemonstrable this side of the grave, at least&ndash;&ndash;then we
must consider that a gulf is fixed between us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Monsignor,&rdquo; she pleaded, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
&ldquo;you see, do you not? When Jesus said that he gave his disciples
power over all evil, did he not mean likewise over all
physical action, and over every physical condition? But did he
mean that they alone should have such power? What a limiting
of infinite Love! No, he meant that every one who followed
him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of thought should
acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself of false
beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate, even
to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized
by the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and
earth. Can&rsquo;t you, a churchman, see it? And can&rsquo;t you see
how shallow your views are? Don&rsquo;t you know that even the
physical body is but a part of the human, material concept,
and therefore a part of the &lsquo;one lie&rsquo; about God, who is Spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle had listened patiently. But now his time had come
to speak in rebuttal. And yet, he would make no attempt to
assail her convictions. He knew well that she would not
yield&ndash;&ndash;at least, to-day. He therefore played another card.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page160' name='book3_page160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;the Church is ever doing
beneficent deeds which do not come to light, and for which
she receives no praise from men. Your own and Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&rsquo;s
elevation to social leadership came through her.
There is also a rumor that the Church afforded you an asylum
on your first night in this city, when, if ever, you needed aid.
The Church shielded and cared for you even in Simit&iacute;. Indeed,
what has she not done for you? And do you now, alas!
turn and rend her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; replied Carmen, &ldquo;I am not unmindful of the
care always bestowed upon me. And I am not ungrateful. But
my gratitude is to my God, who has worked through many
channels to bless me. My account is with Him. Leave it
there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful to Him, to
whom my every thought is consecrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle bit his lip. Then he spoke low and earnestly, while
he held his gaze fixed upon the girl&rsquo;s bright eyes. &ldquo;Miss Carmen,
if you knew that the Church now afforded you the only
refuge from the dangers that threaten, you would turn to her
as a frightened child to its mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear nothing, Monsignor,&rdquo; replied the girl, her face alight
with a smile of complete confidence. &ldquo;I am not the kind who
may be driven by fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded
theological beliefs. Fear has always been a terrible
weapon in the hands of those who have sought to force their
opinions upon their fellow-men. But it is powerless to influence
me. Fear, Monsignor, is sin. It causes men to miss the
mark. And it is time-honored. Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor,
deceived Adam confessed to God that he was afraid. If God
was infinite then, as you admit you believe Him to be now,
who or what made Adam afraid? Whence came the imaginary
power of fear? For, &lsquo;God hath not given us the spirit of fear;
but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.&rsquo; God is love.
And there is no fear in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close
your eyes to threatening evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God. He
is everything to me. I know nothing but Him and His perfect
manifestation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle sat some moments in silence. The picture which
he and the young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest:
he, weighted with years, white of hair, but rugged of
form, with strikingly handsome features and kindly eyes&ndash;&ndash;she,
a child, delicate, almost wraith-like, glowing with a beauty
that was not of earth, and, though untutored in the wiles of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page161' name='book3_page161'></a>161</span>
men, still holding at bay the sagacious representative of a
crushing weight of authority which reached far back through
the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who put
their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which
they wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.</p>
<p>When the churchman again looked up and felt himself
engulfed in the boundless love which emanated from that radiant,
smiling girl, there surged up within him a mighty impulse
to go to her, to clasp her in his arms, to fall at her feet
and pray for even a mite of her own rare spirituality. The
purpose which he had that morning formulated died within
him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed
in his hand. He rose and came and stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas,&rdquo; he
said slowly, taking her hand. &ldquo;What if I should say that I
know better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say that you were right, Monsignor,&rdquo; she replied
gently, looking up into his face with a sweet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you admit the identity of your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsignor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! And that is&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and
then immediately left the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 18</h2>
</div>
<p>Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen
had thrown out a hint of certain rumors regarding
her; but the days passed, and the girl awoke not to
their significance. Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of
a young priest about to leave his flock. When she opened the
paper and caught sight of the news item she gave a little cry,
and immediately forgot all else in her absorption in the closing
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;and I have known no other ambition since the day that little waif
from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead lamp of my
faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality. She said she had
a message for the people up here. Would to God she might know that
her message had borne fruit!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The newspaper slipped from the girl&rsquo;s hands to the floor.
Her eyes, big and shining, stared straight before her. &ldquo;And
I will lead the blind by a way that they know not&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page162' name='book3_page162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>The telephone rang. It was Miss Wall, ready now for the
postponed ride. Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy
as she summoned the car and made her preparations. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go over to his church,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find him!&rdquo;
She hurried back to the newspaper to get the address of the
church from which he had spoken the preceding day. &ldquo;They
will know where he is,&rdquo; she said happily. &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it just
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was
speeding to the distant suburb where the little church was
located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to find a priest,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Oh, you
mustn&rsquo;t ask me any questions! Mrs. Hawley-Crowles doesn&rsquo;t
like to have me talk about certain things, and so I can&rsquo;t tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Wall glanced at her in wonder. But the happy, smiling
countenance disarmed suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; Carmen went on, &ldquo;tell me about yourself.
I&rsquo;m a missionary, you know,&rdquo; she added, thinking of Father
Waite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A missionary! Well, are you trying to convert the society
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by Christianity&ndash;&ndash;not by what the missionaries are now
teaching in the name of Christianity. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about
it some day. Now tell me, why are you unhappy? Why is
your life pitched in such a minor key? Perhaps, together, we
can change it to a major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh. Then
her face grew serious. &ldquo;I am unhappy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I
have arrived nowhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at her inquiringly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
shows you are on the wrong track, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of life&ndash;&ndash;tired of everything, everybody!&rdquo; Miss
Wall sank back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her
brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not tired of life,&rdquo; said Carmen quietly; &ldquo;for
you do not know what life is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied the weary woman. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
she asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!&rdquo;
cried the woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had that stuff preached at me until it turned my stomach!
I hope you are not an emotional, weepy religionist. Let&rsquo;s not
talk about that subject. I&rsquo;m heartily sick of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Carmen cheerily. &ldquo;Padre Jos&egrave; used to
say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page163' name='book3_page163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is a priest&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A priest! Dear me! do you constantly associate with
priests, and talk religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl laughed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
a good deal to do with both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you any better for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;lots!&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>The woman regarded her with curiosity. &ldquo;Tell me something
about your life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They say you are a princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely I am a princess,&rdquo; returned Carmen, laughing merrily.
&ldquo;Listen; I will tell you about big, glorious Simit&iacute;, and
the wonderful castle I lived in there, and about my Prime
Minister, Don Rosendo, and&ndash;&ndash;well, listen, and then judge for
yourself if I am not of royal extraction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoc&oacute;.</p>
<p>As she listened, the woman&rsquo;s eyes grew wide with interest.
At times she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.
And when the girl concluded her brief recital, she bent upon
the sparkling face a look of mingled wonder and admiration.
&ldquo;Goodness! After going through all that, how can you be so
happy now? And with all your kin down there in that awful
war! Why&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I am a princess now?&rdquo; Carmen asked,
smiling up at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are a marvel!&rdquo; was the emphatic answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t want to know what it was that kept me
through it all, and that is still guiding me?&rdquo; The bright,
animated face looked so eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred
features of her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you are going to talk religion. Tell me, who is this
priest you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Waite. He is the one who found me&ndash;&ndash;when I got
lost&ndash;&ndash;and took me to my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before
a dingy little church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten
cross. On the steps of a modest frame house adjoining stood
a man. He turned as the car came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father Waite!&rdquo; Carmen threw wide the door of the car
and sprang out. &ldquo;Father Waite!&rdquo; clasping his hands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know me? I&rsquo;m Carmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light came into the startled man&rsquo;s eyes. He recognized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page164' name='book3_page164'></a>164</span>
her. Then he stepped back, that he might better see her.
More than a year had passed since he had taken her, so oddly
garbed, and clinging tightly to his hand, into the Ketchim
office. And in that time, he thought, she had been transformed
into a vision of heavenly beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried the impatient girl. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to
speak?&rdquo; And with that she threw her arms about him and
kissed him loudly on both cheeks.</p>
<p>The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.
He colored violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth
agape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo; pursued the girl, again grasping
his hands.</p>
<p>Then he found his tongue. &ldquo;An angel from heaven could
not be more welcome,&rdquo; he said. But his voice was low, and
the note of sadness was prominent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am an angel from heaven,&rdquo; said the laughing, artless
girl. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m an Inca princess. And I&rsquo;m just plain Carmen
Ariza. But, whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you
again! I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she looked about carefully&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I read your sermon
in the newspaper this morning. Did you mean me?&rdquo; she concluded
abruptly.</p>
<p>He smiled wanly. &ldquo;Yes, I meant you,&rdquo; he softly answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me now,&rdquo; said the eager girl. &ldquo;I want to talk
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he replied, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, will you come and see me?&rdquo; She thought for a
moment. &ldquo;Why have you never been to see me? Didn&rsquo;t you
know I was still in the city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I used to see your name in the
papers, often. And I have followed your career with great
interest. But&ndash;&ndash;you moved in a circle&ndash;&ndash;from which I&ndash;&ndash;well, it
was hardly possible for me to come to see you, you know&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;But, never mind, you are
coming now. Here,&rdquo; drawing a card from her bag, &ldquo;this is
the address of Madam Beaubien. Will you come there to-morrow
afternoon, at two, and talk with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and
then at the richly-gowned girl before him. He seemed to be
in a dream. But he nodded his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;how is Sister Katie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted
old soul had mourned her &ldquo;little bairn&rdquo; these many months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to see her,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;But first you will
come to me to-morrow.&rdquo; She beamed upon him as she clasped
his hands again. Then she entered the car, and sat waving her
hand back at him as long as he could see her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page165' name='book3_page165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or
Father Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively
<i>rencontre</i>. But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed
in thought, it had been a perfectly natural meeting between
two warm friends. Suddenly the girl turned to the woman.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t anything but money, and fine clothes, and automobiles,
and jewels, you think. And you want something
better. Do you know? I know what it is you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the wondering woman, marveling at
this strange girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s lip trembled slightly when she heard this,
but she did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to love you,&rdquo; the girl continued. &ldquo;Oh, so
much! You&rsquo;re tired of society gabble and gossip; you&rsquo;re tired
of spending on yourself the money you never earned; you&rsquo;re
not a bit of use to anybody, are you? But you want to be.
You&rsquo;re a sort of tragedy, aren&rsquo;t you? Oh, I know. There are
just lots of them in high society, just as weary as you. They
haven&rsquo;t anything but money. And they lack the very greatest
thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love! But, do you know? they don&rsquo;t realize
that, in order to get, they must give. In order to be loved, they
must themselves love. Now you start right in and love the
whole world, love everybody, big and little. And, as you love
people, try to see only their perfection. Never look at a bad
trait, nor a blemish of any sort. Try it. In a week&rsquo;s time you
will be a new woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you do that?&rdquo; the woman asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have <i>always</i> done it,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
anything but love. I never knew what it was to hate or revile.
I never could see what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.
I don&rsquo;t see anything but good&ndash;&ndash;everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman slipped an arm about the girl. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t
mind your talking that way to me,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But I
just couldn&rsquo;t bear to listen to any more religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is to religion!
Love is the tie that binds all together and all to God. Why,
Miss Wall&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Elizabeth, please,&rdquo; interrupted the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, Elizabeth,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;all creeds have got
to merge into just one, some day, and, instead of saying &lsquo;I
believe,&rsquo; everybody will say &lsquo;I understand and I love.&rsquo; Why,
the very person who loved more than anybody else ever did
was the one who saw God most clearly! He knew that if we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page166' name='book3_page166'></a>166</span>
would see God&ndash;&ndash;good everywhere&ndash;&ndash;we would just simply <i>have</i>
to love, for God <i>is</i> love! Don&rsquo;t you see? It is so simple!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; was the emphatic answer. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s children
are not to be pitied&ndash;&ndash;and I see in people only His children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why, then, do you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl replied quickly: &ldquo;God is love. I am His reflection.
I reflect Him to you. That&rsquo;s loving you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she continued cheerily, &ldquo;we are going to work
together, aren&rsquo;t we? You are first going to love everybody.
And then you are going to see just what is right for you to
do&ndash;&ndash;what work you are to take up&ndash;&ndash;what interests you are to
have. But love comes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society? What keeps
you there, in an atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; impatiently. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him,
who is my life. I am where He places me. I leave everything
to Him, and then keep myself out of the way. If He wishes to
use me elsewhere, He will remove me from society. But I wait
for Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked at her and marveled. How could this
girl, who, in her few brief years, had passed through fire and
flood, still love the hand that guided her!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 19</h2>
</div>
<p>To the great horde of starving European nobility the
daughters of American millionaires have dropped as
heavenly manna. It was but dire necessity that forced
low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic traffic between
fortune and title.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase
of a decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought. A tottering
earldom was likewise beyond her purchasing power.
She had contented herself that Carmen should some day barter
her rare culture, her charm, and her unrivaled beauty, for the
more lowly title of an impecunious count or baron. But to
what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when the young
Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name&ndash;&ndash;in exchange for
La Libertad and other good and valuable considerations, receipt
of which would be duly acknowledged.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page167' name='book3_page167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,&rdquo;
that worthy young cad announced one afternoon, as
he sat alone with the successful society leader in the warm
glow of her living room. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;bah Jove! she said we were
engaged, ye know&ndash;&ndash;really! Said we were awfully good friends,
ye know, and all that. &rsquo;Pon my word! she said she loved me.&rdquo;
For Reginald had done much thinking of late&ndash;&ndash;and his creditors
were restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; cried the overpowered Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles, beaming like a full-blown sunflower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do, really! Only&ndash;&ndash;ye know, she&rsquo;ll have to be&ndash;&ndash;coached
a bit, ye know&ndash;&ndash;told who we are&ndash;&ndash;our ancestral history,
and all that. You know what I mean, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&ndash;&ndash;you dear boy! Why, she just couldn&rsquo;t help loving
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;no, of course&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;she has excellent
prospects&ndash;&ndash;financial, I mean, eh? Mines, and all that, ye
know&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South
America! Think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah Jove! I&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;I never was so attracted to a girl in
all me blooming life! You will&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;speak to her, eh? Help
me out, ye know. Just a few words, eh? You know what I
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, Reginald&rdquo; she&rsquo;s yours. &ldquo;There will be no opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opposition! Certainly not&ndash;&ndash;not when she knows about
our family. And&ndash;&ndash;aw&ndash;&ndash;mother will talk with you&ndash;&ndash;that is,
about the details. She&rsquo;ll arrange them, ye know. I never was
good at business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly
thereafter to consult in regard to her son&rsquo;s matrimonial desires.
The nerve-racking round of balls, receptions, and other
society functions was quite forgotten by the elated Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
whose ears tingled deliciously under the pompous
boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern. The house of Altern?
Why, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a half hour&rsquo;s
conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house of
Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit! What was La
Libertad worth? She knew not. But her sister&rsquo;s brother,
Mr. Reed, who had hastily appraised it, had said that there
was a mountain of gold there, only awaiting Yankee enterprise.
And Carmen? There was proof positive that she was
an Inca princess. Yes, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the
wonderful girl! And she would undertake negotiations with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page168' name='book3_page168'></a>168</span>
her at once. But it must be done wisely. Carmen was not
like other girls. No, indeed!</p>
<p>And now Mrs. Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.
She was terribly in debt; yet she had resources. The Beaubien
was inexhaustible. Ames, too, might be depended upon.
And La Libertad&ndash;&ndash;well, there was Mr. Philip O. Ketchim to
reckon with. So she forthwith summoned him to a consultation.</p>
<p>But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit
of good fortune fell into the lady&rsquo;s spacious lap. Reed had
written that he was doing poorly with his western mining
ventures, and would have to raise money at once. He therefore
offered to sell his interest in the Simit&iacute; Company. Moreover,
he wanted his wife to come to him and make her home
in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.
Mrs. Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars
for his Simit&iacute; interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate
acceptance. Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward
Ho! and laid her newly acquired stock before the Beaubien for
a large loan. That was but a day before Ketchim called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, &ldquo;you
are a genius. Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as
our largest stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of
Simit&iacute; stock. The Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.
Er&ndash;&ndash;might I ask, Madam, if you would condescend to
meet my wife some afternoon? We are rapidly acquiring some
standing in a financial way, and Mrs. Ketchim would like to
know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy. She drew herself
up with a regnant air. The people were coming to her, their
social queen, for recognition!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam. He&rsquo;s president
of the C. and R.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise. &ldquo;Possibly
we can arrange it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But now about our other investments.
What is Joplin Zinc doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Progressing splendidly, Madam. We shall declare a dividend
this month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation,
according to the latest report.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meantime, while Mrs. Hawley-Crowles was still laying her
plans to herd the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of
Altern, Father Waite kept his appointment, and called at the
Beaubien mansion on the afternoon Carmen had set. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page169' name='book3_page169'></a>169</span>
warmly received by the girl herself, who had been watching
for his coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were
seated in the music room, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s Jude? I want to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jude? Why, I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea to whom you
refer,&rdquo; returned the puzzled man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman who took me to the Sister Superior,&rdquo; explained
Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! We never saw her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl confidently, &ldquo;I saw her, but she got
away from me. But I shall find her&ndash;&ndash;it is right that I should.
Now tell me, what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea. Earn my living some way,&rdquo; he replied
meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have lots of friends who will help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;I am an apostate, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that means that you&rsquo;re free. The chains have
dropped, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But left me dazed and confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not dazed, nor confused! Why, you&rsquo;re like a
prisoner coming out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.
You&rsquo;re only blinking, that&rsquo;s all. And, as for confusion&ndash;&ndash;well,
if I would admit it to be true I could point to a terrible state
of it! Just think, a duke wants to marry me; Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
is determined that he shall; I am an Inca princess,
and yet I don&rsquo;t know who I am; my own people apparently are
swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment
to keep myself from flying all to pieces! But I guess God intends
to keep me here for the present. Oh, yes, and Monsignor
Lafelle insists that I am a Catholic and that I must join his
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor Lafelle! You&ndash;&ndash;you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very well. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He evaded reply by another query. &ldquo;Is Monsignor Lafelle
working with Madam Beaubien, your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; laughed Carmen. &ldquo;But Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it through him that she became a communicant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he also working with Mr. J. Wilton Ames? He
converted Mrs. Ames&rsquo;s sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.
The young Duke is also going to join the faith, I learn. But&ndash;&ndash;you?&rdquo;
He stopped suddenly and looked searchingly at her.</p>
<p>At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card. Close on
her heels followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor
himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page170' name='book3_page170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him. Lafelle
bent over her hand. Then, as he straightened up, his glance
fell upon Father Waite. The latter bowed without speaking.
For a moment the two men stood eying each other sharply.
Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to Carmen quizzically.
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was not aware that you had
a caller. Madam Beaubien, is she at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carmen simply. &ldquo;She went out for a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the
girl to Father Waite, while a smile curled his lips. &ldquo;I see. I
will intrude no further.&rdquo; He bowed again, and turned toward
the exit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; rang forth Carmen&rsquo;s clear voice. She had caught
the churchman&rsquo;s insinuating glance and instantly read its
meaning. &ldquo;Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The churchman&rsquo;s brows arched with surprise, but he came
back and stood by the chair which she indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And first,&rdquo; went on the girl, standing before him like an
incarnate Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping,
&ldquo;you will hear from me a quotation from the Scripture, on
which you assume to be authority: &lsquo;As a man thinketh in his
heart, so <i>is</i> he!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Lafelle flushed. Then his face darkened.
Finally a bland smile spread over his features, and he sat
down. The girl resumed her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsignor Lafelle,&rdquo; she continued severely, &ldquo;you
have urged me to unite with your Church. When you asked
me to subscribe to your beliefs I looked first at them, and
then at you, their product. You have come here this afternoon
to plead with me again. The thoughts which you accepted
when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil? Or do they
reflect the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal
mind? You told me that your Church would not let me teach
it. Think you I will let it or you teach me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Waite sat amazed at the girl&rsquo;s stinging rebuke.
When she concluded he rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;You, too, shall remain. You have left
the Church of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part. Either you
have done that Church, and him, a great injustice&ndash;&ndash;or he does
ignorant or wilful wrong in insisting that I unite with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Lafelle gently, now recovered and
wholly on his guard, &ldquo;your impetuosity gets the better of your
judgment. This is no occasion for a theological discussion,
nor are you sufficiently informed to bear a part in such. As
for myself, you unintentionally do me great wrong. As I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page171' name='book3_page171'></a>171</span>
repeatedly told you, I seek only your eternal welfare. Else
would I not labor with you as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned to Father Waite. &ldquo;Is my eternal welfare
dependent upon acceptance of the Church&rsquo;s doctrines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, in a scarcely audible voice.</p>
<p>A cynical look came into Lafelle&rsquo;s eyes. But he replied
affably: &ldquo;When preachers fall out, the devil falls in. Your
reply, Mr. Waite, comes quite consistently from one who has
impudently tossed aside authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My authority, Monsignor,&rdquo; returned the ex-priest in a low
tone, &ldquo;is Jesus Christ, who said: &lsquo;Love thy neighbor as thyself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Lafelle; &ldquo;then it was love that prompted
you to abandon your little flock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give
my people. I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.
And I refused longer to take the poor people&rsquo;s money to support
an institution so politically religious as I believe your
Church to be. I could no longer take their money to purchase
the release of their loved ones from an imagined purgatory&ndash;&ndash;a
place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural warrant&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake, sir!&rdquo; interrupted Lafelle in an angry tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Monsignor,&rdquo; replied Father Waite; &ldquo;grant,
then, that there is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless
know that the existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible
with the reign of an infinite God of love. And, knowing
that, I have ceased to extort gifts of money from the ignorance
of the living and the ghastly terrors of the dying&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act
in removing their greatest consolation,&rdquo; the churchman again
interrupted, a sneer curving his lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consolation! The consolation which the stupifying drug
affords, yes! Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces
of my poor people, week after week, I knew that no sacerdotal
intervention was needed to remit their sins, for their sins were
but their unsolved problems of life. Oh, the poor, grief-stricken
mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes upon me as I preached
the &lsquo;authority&rsquo; of the Fathers! Well I knew that, when I told
them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if baptized,
went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my words!
And when I went further and told them that their dead babes
had joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be
prayed to, could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly
grasped the false message of cheer? They believed because
they wanted it to be so. And yet those utterances of mine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page172' name='book3_page172'></a>172</span>
based upon the accepted doctrine of Holy Church, were but
narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds into a false sense
of rest and security, and checking all further human progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It is to be regretted,&rdquo; he
said coldly, &ldquo;that such narrowness of view should be permitted
to impede the salvation of souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvation&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;souls!&rdquo; exclaimed Father Waite. &ldquo;Ah,
how many souls have I not saved!&ndash;&ndash;and yet I know not whether
they or I be really saved! Saved? From what? From death?
Certainly not! From misery, disease, suffering in this life?
No, alas, no! Saved, then, from what? Ah, my friend, saved
only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory constructed
in the fertile minds of busy theologians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle turned to Carmen. &ldquo;Some other day, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;when
it may be more convenient for us both&ndash;&ndash;and you are
alone&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quit the field, Monsignor&ndash;&ndash;unless
you surrender abjectly. You started this controversy, remember.
And you were quite indiscreet, if you will recall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor bowed, smiling. &ldquo;You write my faults in brass,&rdquo;
he gently lamented. &ldquo;When you publish my virtues, if you find
that I am possessed of any, I fear you will write them in
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed again. &ldquo;Your virtues should advertise
themselves, Monsignor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your
welfare above all else, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the welfare of this great country, which you have
come here to assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so,
Monsignor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle started slightly. Then he smiled genially back at
the girl. &ldquo;It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own,&rdquo;
he returned gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Monsignor,&rdquo; Carmen continued earnestly, &ldquo;are you
not aware of the inevitable failure of your mission? Do you
not know that mediaeval theology comports not with modern
progress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my child,&rdquo; replied the churchman. &ldquo;And more,
that our so-called modern progress&ndash;&ndash;modernism, free-thinking,
liberty of conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance
of beliefs and false creeds&ndash;&ndash;constitutes the greatest menace now
confronting this fair land. Its end is inevitable anarchy and
chaos. Perhaps you can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;in the Middle Ages the Church
was supreme. Emperors and kings bowed in submission before
her. The world was dominantly Catholic. Would you be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page173' name='book3_page173'></a>173</span>
willing, for the sake of Church supremacy to-day, to return to
the state of society and civilization then obtaining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South
America, all Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute
not their oppression, their ignorance, their low morals
and stunted manhood, to the dominance of churchly doctrines,
which oppose freedom of conscience and press and speech, and
make learning the privilege of the clergy and the rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old argument, child,&rdquo; deprecated Lafelle. &ldquo;May
I not point to France, on the contrary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has all but driven the Church from her borders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is still Catholic!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;And England, though
Anglican, calls herself Catholic. She will return to the true
fold. Germany is forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light
shining still undimmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at Father Waite. The latter read in her
glance an invitation further to voice his own convictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times,&rdquo; he
said slowly. &ldquo;The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic
theories enunciated with such assumption of authority
by ignorant, often blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.
The religion of our fathers, which is our present-day evangelical
theology, was derived from the traditions of the early
churchmen. They put their seal upon it; and we blindly accept
it as authority, despite the glaring, irrefutable fact that it is
utterly undemonstrable. Why do the people continue to be
deceived by it? Alas! only because of its mesmeric promise
of immortality beyond the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite.
&ldquo;Fortunately, your willingness to plunge the Christian world
into chaos will fail of concrete results,&rdquo; he said coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor. For
them, too, the time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia
of images, candles, and all the trinkets used in the pagan
ceremonial which has so quenched our spirituality, and to seek
the undivided garment of the Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; murmured Lafelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new
era, an era which promises a grander concept of God and religion,
the tie which binds all to Him, than has ever before
been known. We are thinking. We are pondering. We are
delving, studying, reflecting. And we are at last beginning to
work with true scientific precision and system. As in chemistry,
mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters religious,
we are beginning to <i>prove</i> our working hypotheses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page174' name='book3_page174'></a>174</span>
And so a new spiritual enlightenment is come. People are
awaking to a dim perception of the meaning of spiritual
life, as exemplified in Jesus Christ. And they are vaguely beginning
to see that it is possible to every one. The abandonment
of superstition, religious and other, has resulted in such
a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most marvelous
material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour
to-day than our fathers lived in weeks before us. Oh, yes, we
are already growing tired of materiality. The world is not
yet satisfied. We are not happy. But, Monsignor, let not the
Church boast itself that the acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas
will meet the world&rsquo;s great need. That need will be met,
I think, only as we more and more clearly perceive the tremendous
import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how to
grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used
and told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During Father Waite&rsquo;s earnest talk Lafelle sat with his
eyes fixed upon Carmen. When the ex-priest concluded, the
churchman ignored him and vouchsafed no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Monsignor?&rdquo; said the girl, after waiting some moments
in expectation.</p>
<p>Lafelle smiled paternally. Then, nodding his shapely head,
he said in a pleading tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I no champion here? Would you, too, suddenly
abolish the Church, Catholic and Protestant alike? Why, my
dear child, with your ideals&ndash;&ndash;which no one appreciates more
highly than I&ndash;&ndash;do you continue to persecute me so cruelly?
Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of the views just now
so eloquently voiced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is cant, Monsignor! You speak wholly without
authority or proof, as is your wont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man winced slightly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are
several hundred million Catholics and Protestants in the world
to-day. Would you presume to say that they are all mistaken,
and that you are right? Something of an assumption, is it
not? Indeed, I think you set the Church an example in that
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who
believed that the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about
it. Were they mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But the&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that
matter is a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life
and sensation. There are billions who believe that the physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page175' name='book3_page175'></a>175</span>
eyes see, and the ears hear, and the hands feel. Yet these beliefs
are all capable of scientific refutation. Did you know
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation,&rdquo;
he returned suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not mere speculation, Monsignor,&rdquo; put in Father
Waite. &ldquo;The beliefs of the human mind are its fetish. Such
beliefs become in time national customs, and men defend them
with frenzy, utterly wrong and undemonstrable though they
be. Then they remain as the incubus of true progress. By
them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks. And the mind that clings to them will
then mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical
neighbors and stone them to death for disagreeing. So now,
you would stone me for obeying Christ&rsquo;s command to take up
my bed on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle heaved a great sigh. &ldquo;Still you blazon my faults,&rdquo;
he said in a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen.
&ldquo;But, like the Church which you persecute, I shall endure. We
have been martyred throughout the ages. And we are very
patient. Our wayward children forsake us,&rdquo; nodding toward
Father Waite, &ldquo;and yet we welcome their return when they
have tired of the husks. The press teems with slander against
us; we are reviled from east to west. But our reply is that
such slander and untruth can best be met by our leading
individual lives of such an exemplary nature as to cause all
men to be attracted by our holy light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Monsignor,&rdquo; quickly replied Carmen.
&ldquo;Scurrilous attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.
Vilification returns upon the one who hurls the abuse. One
can not fling mud without soiling one&rsquo;s hands. I oppose not
men, but human systems of thought. Whatever is good will
stand, and needs no defense. Whatever is erroneous must go.
And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salvation? And your thought regarding that?&rdquo; he said in
a skirmishing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts</i>,&rdquo; she replied earnestly. &ldquo;<i>To him that soweth
righteousness</i>&ndash;&ndash;right thinking&ndash;&ndash;<i>shall be a sure reward</i>. Ah,
Monsignor, do you at heart believe that the religion of the
Christ depends upon doctrines, signs, dogmas? No, it does not.
But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably follow the right
understanding of Jesus&rsquo; teachings, even according to these
words: <i>These signs shall follow them that believe</i>. Paul gave
the formula for salvation, when he said: <i>But we all with open
face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page176' name='book3_page176'></a>176</span>
into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit
of the Lord</i>. Can you understand that? Can you see that,
taking Jesus as our model and following his every command&ndash;&ndash;seeing
Him only, the Christ-principle, which is God, good, without
any admixture of evil&ndash;&ndash;we change, even though slowly,
from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all sense
of evil and death? And this is done by the Spirit which is
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when
she paused. &ldquo;Even the poorest human being can understand
that. Why, then, the fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies,
rites and forms which have sprung up about the Master&rsquo;s
simple words? Why the wretched formalistic worship throughout
the world? Why the Church&rsquo;s frigid, lifeless traditions,
so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God which marks
this latest century? The Church has yet to prove its utility,
its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of mankind.
Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at
the root of the barren tree of theology. Her theology, like the
Judaism of the Master&rsquo;s day, has no prophets, no poets, no
singers. And her priests, as in his time, have sunk into a
fanatical observance of ritual and form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; observed Carmen, &ldquo;you still urge me to unite
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle was growing weary. Moreover, it irked him sore to
be made a target for the unassailable logic of the apostate
Waite. Then, too, the appearance of the ex-priest there that
afternoon in company with this girl who held such radical
views regarding religious matters portended in his thought the
possibility of a united assault upon the foundations of his
cherished system. This girl was now a menace. She nettled
and exasperated him. Yet, he could not let her alone. Did he
have the power to silence her? He thought he had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you finished with me?&rdquo; he asked, with a show of
gaiety. &ldquo;If so, I will depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Carmen, &ldquo;you may go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafelle paled. He had not expected that reply. He was
stung to the quick. What! dismissed like a lackey? He, Monsignor,
a dignitary of Holy Church? He could not believe it!
He turned upon the girl and her companion, furious with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been very patient with you both,&rdquo; he said in a voice
that he could not control. &ldquo;But there is a reasonable limit.
Abuse the Church as you will, the fact remains that the world
fears her and trembles before her awful voice! Why? Because
the world recognizes her mighty power, a power of unified
millions of human beings and exhaustless wealth. She is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page177' name='book3_page177'></a>177</span>
the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object of
worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives
to-day for her. Her subjects gather from every quarter of the
globe. They are English, French, German, American&ndash;&ndash;<i>but they
are Catholics first</i>! Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government&ndash;&ndash;all
are alike subject to her supreme, divine authority! Nationalities,
customs, family ties&ndash;&ndash;all melt away before her, to
whom her followers bow in loyal consecration. The power
which her supreme leader and head wields is all but omnipotent!
He is by divine decree Lord of the world. Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and
swords! I say, you have good reason to quake! Aye, America
has reason to fear! The onward march of Holy Church is not
disturbed by the croaking calumnies of such as you who would
assault her! And to you I say, beware!&rdquo; His face was purple,
as he stopped and mopped his damp brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we have to beware of, Monsignor,&rdquo; said Father
Waite gravely, &ldquo;is the steady encroachments of Rome in this
country, with her weapons of fear, ignorance, and intolerance&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intolerance! You speak of intolerance! Why, in this
country, whose Constitution provided toleration for every form
of religion&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen had risen and gone to the man. &ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;the founders of the American nation did provide for
religious tolerance&ndash;&ndash;and they were wise according to their
light. But we of this day are still wiser, for we have some
knowledge of the wonderful working of mental laws. I, too,
believe in toleration of opinion. You are welcome to yours,
and I to mine. But&ndash;&ndash;and here is the great point&ndash;&ndash;the opinion
which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding
those who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned,
that they are outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and
rack. The Church&rsquo;s hatred of heretics has been deadly. Her
thought concerning them has not been that of love, such as
Jesus sent out to all who did not agree with him, but deadly,
suggestive hatred. Now our Constitution does not provide for
tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter the minds
of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form of
disease, disaster, and death. That is what we object to in
you, Monsignor. You murder your opponents with your poisonous
thoughts. And toward such thoughts we have a right to
be very intolerant, even to the point of destroying them in
human mentalities. Again I say, I war not against people, but
against the murderous carnal thought of the human mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsignor had fallen back before the girl&rsquo;s strong words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page178' name='book3_page178'></a>178</span>
His face had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; continued Carmen in a low, steady voice,
&ldquo;you have threatened me with something which you apparently
hold over me. You are very like the people of Galilee: if you
can not refute by reason, you would circumvent by law, by the
Constitution, by Congress. That failing, you would destroy.
Instead of threatening us with the flames of hell for not being
good, why do you not show us by the great example of Jesus&rsquo;
love how to be so? Are you manifesting love now&ndash;&ndash;or the
carnal mind? I judge your Church by such as manifest it to
me. How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose slowly and took her by the hand. &ldquo;I beg your
pardon,&rdquo; he said in a strange, unnatural voice. &ldquo;I was hasty.
As you see, I am zealous. Naturally, I resent misjudgment.
And I assure you that you quite misunderstand me, and the
Church which I represent. But&ndash;&ndash;I may come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Monsignor,&rdquo; returned the girl heartily. &ldquo;A debate
such as this is stimulating, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and turned to go. Just then the Beaubien appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsignor,&rdquo; she said lightly, as she stepped into the
room. &ldquo;You are exclusive. Why have you avoided me since
your return to America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Lafelle, in some confusion, &ldquo;no one
regrets more than I the press of business which necessitated
it. But your little friend has told me I may return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always welcome, Monsignor,&rdquo; replied the Beaubien, scanning
him narrowly as she accompanied him to the door. &ldquo;By
the way, you forgot our little compact, did you not?&rdquo; she added
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor. <i>Adieu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made
her acquainted with Father Waite, and related the conversation
with Lafelle. While the girl talked the Beaubien&rsquo;s expression
grew serious. Then Carmen launched into her association
with the ex-priest, concluding with: &ldquo;And he must
have something to do, right away, to earn his living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien laughed. She always did when Carmen, no
matter how serious the conversation, infused her sparkling
animation into it. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t nearly as important as to know
what he thinks about Monsignor&rsquo;s errand here this afternoon,
dearie,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Father Waite bowed. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said with great seriousness,
&ldquo;I would be very wide awake.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page179' name='book3_page179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>The Beaubien studied him for a moment. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&ndash;&ndash;I think&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He hesitated, and looked at Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&ndash;&ndash;has been greatly angered by&ndash;&ndash;this girl&ndash;&ndash;and
by my presence here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Her face set hard. Then abruptly: &ldquo;What are
you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam,
while making plans for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then remain where I can keep in touch with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours&rsquo; ride
with J. Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 20</h2>
</div>
<p>The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast
room. Carmen nestled at her feet. The maid had just
removed the remains of the light luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, please, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t look so serious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl&rsquo;s flowing
locks. &ldquo;I will try, girlie,&rdquo; she said, though her voice broke.</p>
<p>Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning.
&ldquo;Will you not tell me?&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Ever since Monsignor
Lafelle and Father Waite were here you have been so quiet;
and that was nearly a week ago. I know I can help, if you
will only let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you help, dearie?&rdquo; asked the woman absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal
and powerless,&rdquo; came the quick, invariable reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sweet child! Can nothing shake your faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around
me, I&rsquo;d know it wasn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are chained&ndash;&ndash;and the fire has been kindled,&rdquo;
said the woman in a voice that fell to a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your thought is wrong&ndash;&ndash;all wrong! And wrong
thought just <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be externalized to me, for I know that &lsquo;There
shall no mischief happen to the righteous,&rsquo; that is, to the right-thinking.
And I think right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do, child.&rdquo; The Beaubien got up and walked
slowly around the room, as if to summon her strength. Then
she returned to her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;You are right,
and I have been wrong. It concerns you. And you have help
that I have not. I&ndash;&ndash;I have lost a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page180' name='book3_page180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>Carmen laughed in relief. &ldquo;Well, dear me! that&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien smiled sadly. &ldquo;I agree with you. Mr. Ames
may have my money. I have discovered in the past few months
that there are better things in life. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her lips tightened,
and her eyes half closed&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he can <i>not</i> have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! He wants <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken
something in every life into which you come. The woman I
was a year ago and the woman I am to-day meet almost as
strangers now. Why? The only answer I can give is, you. I
don&rsquo;t know what you did to people in South America; I can
only surmise. Yet of this I am certain, wherever you went
you made a path of light. But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures. Just why this is, I do not know.
It must have something to do with those mental laws of which
I am so ignorant, and of which you know so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation. The
Beaubien smiled down into the face upturned so lovingly, and
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what you have told me about your priest, Jos&egrave;, I
know that you were the light of his life. He loved you to the
complete obliteration of every other interest. You have not
said so; but I know it. How, indeed, could it be otherwise? On
the other hand, that heartless Diego&ndash;&ndash;his mad desire to get
possession of you was only animal. Why should you, a child
of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said the girl, laying her head on the woman&rsquo;s
knees, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s worrying you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;but I think of it so often. And, as for me, you have
turned me inside-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed again merrily. &ldquo;Well, I think this side
wears better, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is softer&ndash;&ndash;it may not,&rdquo; returned the woman gently. &ldquo;But
I have no desire to change back.&rdquo; She bent and kissed the
brown hair. &ldquo;Mr. Ames and I have been&ndash;&ndash;no, not friends. I
had no higher ideals than he, and I played his game with him.
Then you came. And at a time when he had involved me
heavily financially. The Colombian revolution&ndash;&ndash;his cotton
deal&ndash;&ndash;he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny&ndash;&ndash;he must have
known that to involve me meant control whenever he might
need me! He needs me now, for I stand between him and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Carmen was on her feet. &ldquo;God stands between
me and every form of evil!&rdquo; She sat down on the arm
of the Beaubien&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;Is it because you will not let him
have me that he threatens to ruin you financially?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He couldn&rsquo;t ruin me in reputation, for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her voice
again faded to a whisper, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page181' name='book3_page181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true!&rdquo; cried the girl, throwing her arms about
the woman&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Your true self is just coming to light!
Why, it is beautiful! And I love it so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears. The
strain of weeks was at last manifesting. &ldquo;Oh, I have been in
the gutter!&ndash;&ndash;he dragged me through the mire!&ndash;&ndash;and I let him!
I did it for money, money! I gave my soul for it! I schemed
and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged with him; I murdered
reputations and blasted lives with him, that I might get
money, dirty, blood-stained money! Oh, Carmen, I didn&rsquo;t
know what I was doing, until you came! And now I&rsquo;d hang
on the cross if I could undo it! But it&rsquo;s too late! And he has
you and me in his clutches, and he is crushing us!&rdquo; She bent
her head and sobbed violently.</p>
<p>Carmen bent over the weeping woman. &ldquo;Be still, and <i>know</i>
that I am God.&rdquo; The Beaubien raised her head and smiled
feebly through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He governs all, dearest,&rdquo; whispered Carmen, as she drew
the woman&rsquo;s head to her breast. &ldquo;And He is <i>everywhere</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go away!&rdquo; cried the Beaubien, starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flee from our problems?&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;But they
would follow. No, we will stay and meet them, right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien&rsquo;s hand shook as she clasped Carmen&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t turn to Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston. They are all
afraid of him. I&rsquo;ve ruined Gannette myself&ndash;&ndash;for him! I&rsquo;ve
ruined Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawley-Crowles!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;how did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lent her money&ndash;&ndash;took her notes&ndash;&ndash;which I sold again to
Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can buy them back, can&rsquo;t you? And return the
money to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ve tried! He refuses to sell them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then give her your own money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments
I made at his direction,&rdquo; wailed the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try&ndash;&ndash;I am trying, desperately! I will save her, if I
can! But&ndash;&ndash;there is Monsignor Lafelle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he working with Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He works with and against him. And I&rsquo;m sure he holds
something over you and me. But, I will send for him&ndash;&ndash;I will
renew my vows to his Church&ndash;&ndash;anything to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, dearest,&rdquo; interrupted Carmen. &ldquo;I will go to Mr.
Ames myself. If I am the cause of it all, I can&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page182' name='book3_page182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You will not!&rdquo; cried the Beaubien fiercely. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I would
kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother dearest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The desperate woman put her head in the girl&rsquo;s lap and
sobbed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a way out, dearest,&rdquo; whispered Carmen. &ldquo;I <i>know</i>
there is, no matter what seems to be or to happen, for &lsquo;underneath
are the everlasting arms.&rsquo; I am not afraid. Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
told me this morning that Mrs. Ames intends to
give a big reception next week. Of course we will go. And
then I will see Mr. Ames and talk with him. Don&rsquo;t fear, dearest.
He will do it for me. And&ndash;&ndash;it will be right, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day,
struggling with her to close the door upon her sordid past, and
to open it wide to &ldquo;that which is to come.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The days following were busy ones for many with whom
our story is concerned. Every morning saw Carmen on her
way to the Beaubien, to comfort and advise. Every afternoon
found her yielding gently to the relentless demands of society,
or to the tiresome calls of her thoroughly ardent wooer, the
young Duke of Altern. Carmen would have helped him if
she could. But she found so little upon which to build. And
she bore with him largely on account of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
for whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring. The
young man tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and
all society was agog with expectation of the public announcement
of their engagement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of
unruffled joy. The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.
Her broker, Ketchim, basked in the sunlight of her golden
smiles&ndash;&ndash;and quietly sold his own Simit&iacute; stock on the strength
of her patronage. Society fawned and smirked at her approach,
and envied her brilliant success, as it copied the cut
of her elaborate gowns&ndash;&ndash;all but the deposed Mrs. Ames and
her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received
a call from Monsignor Lafelle. This was shortly after
that gentleman&rsquo;s meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in
the Beaubien mansion. And he left the Ames home with an
ominous look on his face. &ldquo;The girl is a menace,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;and she deserves her fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant
event of the year, barring the famous <i>Bal de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra</i>,
was set for Thursday. But neither Mrs. Hawley-Crowles nor
Carmen had received invitations. To the former it was evident
that there was some mistake. &ldquo;For it can&rsquo;t be possible that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page183' name='book3_page183'></a>183</span>
hussy doesn&rsquo;t intend to invite us!&rdquo; she argued. But Thursday
morning came, and found Mrs. Hawley-Crowles drenched with
tears of anxiety and vexation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call her up and ask, if I
dared,&rdquo; she groaned. But her courage failed. And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver. His
arrival was instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on
the morning following, summoned both him and Philip O.
Ketchim to his private office. There were present, also, Monsignor
Lafelle and Alonzo Hood. Harris and Ketchim came
together. The latter was observed to change color as he timidly
entered the room and faced the waiting audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Ames genially, after cordially
shaking hands with them and introducing the churchman.
Then, turning to Harris, &ldquo;You are on your way to Colombia,
I learn. Going down to inaugurate work on the Simit&iacute; holdings,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim. The latter sat
blank, wondering if there were any portions of the earth to
which Ames&rsquo;s long arms did not reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; Ames continued, leaning back in his
chair and pressing the tips of his fingers together before him,
&ldquo;a hitch seems to have developed in Simit&iacute; proceedings. I am
interested, Mr. Ketchim,&rdquo; turning suddenly and sharply upon
that gentleman, &ldquo;because my brokers have picked up for me
several thousand shares of the stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim&rsquo;s hair began to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; proceeded Ames calmly, &ldquo;now that I have put money
into it, I learn that the Simit&iacute; Company has no property whatever
in Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim&rsquo;s eyes. His ears
hummed. His heart throbbed violently. &ldquo;How do you make
that out, Mr. Ames?&rdquo; he heard Harris say in a voice that
seemed to come from an infinite distance. &ldquo;I myself saw the
title papers which old Rosendo had, and saw them transferred
to Mr. Ketchim for the Simit&iacute; Company. Moreover, I personally
visited the mine in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Libertad? Quite so,&rdquo; returned Ames. &ldquo;But, here&rsquo;s the
rub. The property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he
secured title to it under the name of the Chicago mine. It was
that name which deceived the clerks in the Department of
Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to issue title, not knowing
that it really was the famous old La Libertad.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page184' name='book3_page184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that there is any ground for confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply this,&rdquo; returned Ames evenly: &ldquo;La Libertad mine,
since the death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n,
has belonged to the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Harris was on his feet. &ldquo;By what right does it
belong to the Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the ancient law of <i>&lsquo;en manos muertas&rsquo;</i>, my friend,&rdquo;
replied Ames, unperturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church,
will explain,&rdquo; said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman.</p>
<p>Lafelle cleared his throat. &ldquo;I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;But, as Mr. Ames has pointed
out, the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine
under the name Chicago. Don Ignacio de Rinc&oacute;n, long before
his departure from Colombia after the War of Independence,
drew up his last will, and, following the established custom
among wealthy South Americans of that day, bequeathed this
mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the Church, invoking
the old law of <i>&lsquo;en manos muertas&rsquo;</i> which, being translated,
means, &lsquo;in dead hands.&rsquo; Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries. Such a bequest places
property in the custody of the Church; and it may never be
sold or disposed of in any way, but all revenue from it must
be devoted to the purchase of Masses for the souls in purgatory.
It was through the merest chance, I assure you, that your mistake
was brought to light. Knowing that our friend, Mr. Ames,
had purchased stock in your company, I took the pains to
investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the discovery
which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God a&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo; exploded Harris. &ldquo;Did you know this?&rdquo;
turning savagely upon the paralyzed Ketchim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; interposed Ames with cruel significance, &ldquo;is a matter
which he will explain in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had
sold; of the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom
he had involved; of the notes which the banks held against
him; of his questionable deals with Mrs. Hawley-Crowles; and
of the promiscuous peddling of his own holdings in the now
ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of this young
genius of high finance. His tongue froze, though his trembling
body dripped with perspiration. Somehow he got to his feet.
Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator. And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted
day and night.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page185' name='book3_page185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were
drinking in the startling report of the Simit&iacute; Company&rsquo;s collapse,
as set forth in the newspaper which he clutched in his
shaking hand, the maid led in a soft-stepping gentleman, who
laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and read to him from
a familiar-looking document an irresistible invitation to take
up lodgings in the city jail.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There were other events forward at the same time, which
came to light that fateful next day. It was noon when Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles, after a night of mingled worry and anger over
the deliberate or unintentional exclusion of herself and Carmen
from the Ames reception the preceding night, descended to
her combined breakfast and luncheon. At her plate lay the
morning mail, including a letter from France. She tore it open,
hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&ndash;&ndash;married to&ndash;&ndash;a French&ndash;&ndash;adventuress! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his
snug fortune lay blasted at her feet.</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to
answer it. The call came from the city editor of one of the
great dailies. &ldquo;It is reported,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;that your ward,
Miss Carmen Ariza, is the illegitimate daughter of a negro
priest, now in South America. We would like your denial, for
we learn that it was for this reason that you and the young
lady were not included among the guests at the Ames reception
last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawley-Crowles&rsquo;s legs tottered under her, as she
blindly wandered from the telephone without replying. Carmen&ndash;&ndash;the
daughter of a priest! Her father a negro&ndash;&ndash;her
mother, what? She, a mulatto, illegitimate&ndash;&ndash;!</p>
<p>The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning
paper which lay on the table. Her glance was at once attracted
to the great headlines announcing the complete exposure
of the Simit&iacute; bubble. Her eyes nearly burst from her
head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her. With a low,
inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and
groped her way back to her boudoir.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding
to the Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling
young woman, as it halted for a moment at a street corner.
Carmen recognized her as a reporter for one of the evening
papers, who had called often at the Hawley-Crowles mansion
that season for society items.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fortunate!&rdquo; exclaimed the young reporter. &ldquo;I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page186' name='book3_page186'></a>186</span>
on my way to see you. Our office received a report this morning
from some source that your father&ndash;&ndash;you know, there has
been some mystery about your parentage&ndash;&ndash;that he was really
a priest, of South America. His name&ndash;&ndash;let me think&ndash;&ndash;what
did they say it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&egrave;?&rdquo; laughed the innocent girl, utterly unsuspecting.
The problem of her descent had really become a source of
amusement to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It began with a D, if I am not mistaken. I&rsquo;m not up on
Spanish names,&rdquo; the young woman returned pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps you mean Diego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Was that your father&rsquo;s name? We&rsquo;re very
much interested to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t say. It might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t deny it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; how can I?&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;I never knew him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you think it was, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe it was Padre Diego&ndash;&ndash;he wasn&rsquo;t a
good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you knew him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well! I was in his house, in Banco. He used to
insist that I was his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn&rsquo;t
you? Here in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; she exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;Do you know
where she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But she took you out of a house down on&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;ve tried to find her ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, very well. We&rsquo;re good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and he going to work together, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s very unsettled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! yes. Well, I thank you very much. You think this
Diego might have been your father? That is, you can&rsquo;t say
positively that he wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say positively, no. But now I must go. You can
come up to the house and talk about South America, if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away. The innocent,
ingenuous girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering
and dissemination means in this great Republic. But
she rode on, happy in the thought that she and the Beaubien
were formulating plans to save Mrs. Hawley-Crowles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrange it somehow,&rdquo; said the Beaubien, looking up
from her papers when Carmen entered. &ldquo;Go, dearie, and play
the organ while I finish this. Then I will return home with
you to have a talk with Mrs. Hawley-Crowles.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book3_page187' name='book3_page187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.
The Beaubien at her desk below stopped often to listen. And
often she would hastily brush away the tears, and plunge again
into her papers. &ldquo;I suppose I should have told Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t give her any hope. And
even now it&rsquo;s very uncertain. Ames <i>will</i> yield! I&rsquo;ll force him
to! He knows I can expose him! And yet,&rdquo; she reflected sadly,
&ldquo;who would believe <i>me</i>?&rdquo; The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her
car and directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles
home. As they entered a main thoroughfare they heard the
newsboys excitedly crying extras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible suicide! Double extra! Big mining scandal!
Society woman blows out brains! Double extra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending
evil came to the girl. She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien&rsquo;s
hand. Then there flitted through her mind like a beam of
light the words of the psalmist: &ldquo;A thousand shall fall at
thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not
come nigh thee.&rdquo; She sank back against the Beaubien&rsquo;s shoulder
and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>The car rolled on. Presently the chauffeur turned and
said something through the speaking tube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.
&ldquo;Merciful heaven! Stop and get a paper at once!&rdquo; The
chauffeur complied.</p>
<p>A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced
at the startling headlines. Mrs. James Hawley-Crowles, financially
ruined, and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social
leadership by the awful exposure of the parentage of her ward,
had been found in her bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped
in her cold hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
</div>
<p>The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the
masonry-lined ca&ntilde;ons of the metropolis and sighed
among the stark trees of its deserted parks. They caught
up the tinted leaves that dropped from quivering branches and
tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human hopes before
she blows her icy breath upon them. They shrieked among
the naked spars of the <i>Cossack</i>, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves. They moaned in
low-toned agony among the marble pillars of the Crowles
mausoleum, where lay in pitying sleep the misguided woman
whose gods of gold and tinsel had betrayed her.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb,
a slender girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked
slowly against the sharp wind, holding her hat with her free
hand, and talking rapidly to a young man who accompanied
her. Toward them came an old negro, leaning upon a cane.
As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl looked up.
Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his coat
pocket as she passed.</p>
<p>The negro stood in dumb amazement. He was poor&ndash;&ndash;his
clothes were thin and worn&ndash;&ndash;but he was not a beggar&ndash;&ndash;he had
asked nothing. The girl turned and threw back a smile to
him. Then of a sudden there came into the old man&rsquo;s wrinkled,
care-lined face such a look, such a comprehension of
that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek nor
Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost
of defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.</p>
<p>A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed
the girl&rsquo;s right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh
to her companion. But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a
heap of dead leaves about her feet. Glancing down, something
caught her eye. She stooped and took up a two-dollar bill.</p>
<p>Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_4' name='book4_page_4'></a>4</span>
made no comment. In silence they went on, until a few minutes
more of brisk walking brought them to a newly built,
stucco-coated bungalow. Running rapidly up the steps, the
girl threw wide the door and called, &ldquo;Mother dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty
embrace. &ldquo;Well, dearie?&rdquo; she said, devouring the sparkling
creature with eager eyes. &ldquo;What luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re registered! Lewis begins his law course at once,
and I may take what I wish. And Mr. Hitt&rsquo;s coming to call
to-night and bring a friend, a Mr. Haynerd, an editor. What&rsquo;s
Jude got for supper? My! I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and
again. Then she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a
bantering twinkle in her eyes and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you
could do that? But you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes he can, too, mother,&rdquo; asserted the girl.</p>
<p>Father Waite sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;And, besides, I don&rsquo;t dare lose my heart to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien&rsquo;s
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen. &ldquo;What
is it to-night, Jude?&rdquo; she demanded, catching the domestic in
a vigorous embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Jude, holding up a finger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret. I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;d tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word&ndash;&ndash;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island,&rdquo; she
whispered, very mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody!&rdquo; cried Carmen. &ldquo;He just loves them both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed
gaze of both the Beaubien and Father Waite. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she
demanded, stopping and looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that two dollars?&rdquo; said the Beaubien, in a tone
of mock severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating
herself in the waiting lap, &ldquo;he told, didn&rsquo;t he? Can&rsquo;t I ever
trust you with a secret?&rdquo; in a tone of rebuke, turning to the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he replied, laughing; &ldquo;and I should not have
divulged this had I not seen in the incident something more
than mere chance&ndash;&ndash;something meant for us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he became serious. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I think I have seen the working
of a stupendous mental law&ndash;&ndash;am I not right?&rdquo; addressing
the girl. &ldquo;You saw a need, and met it, unsolicited. You found
your own in another&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying. &ldquo;What
about it, dearie?&rdquo; the latter asked tenderly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_5' name='book4_page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She need not answer,&rdquo; said Father Waite, &ldquo;for we know.
She but cast her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love,
and it returned to her, wondrously enriched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay,&rdquo; declared
Carmen, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to help Jude.&rdquo; And
she departed for the kitchen, but not without leaving a smile
for each of them as she went. And they understood.</p>
<p>The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in
silence. Then the woman spoke. &ldquo;I am learning,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She is the light that is guiding me. This little incident which
you have just related is but a manifestation of the law of love
by which she lives. She gave, unasked, and with no desire to
be seen and advertised. It returned to her ten-fold. It is always
so with her. There was no chance, no miracle, no luck
about it. She herself did nothing. It was&ndash;&ndash;it was&ndash;&ndash;only the
working of her beloved Christ-principle. Oh, Lewis! if we
only knew&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>shall</i> know, Madam!&rdquo; declared the man vehemently.
&ldquo;Her secret is but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open
to a world too dull to comprehend. Carmen shall teach us.
And,&rdquo; his eyes brightening, &ldquo;to that end I have been formulating
a great plan. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve asked Hitt to come here
to-night. I have a scheme to propose. Remember, my dear
friend, we are true searchers; and &lsquo;all things work together for
good to them that love God.&rsquo; Our love of truth and real good
is so great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation,
it is <i>bound</i> to bring the Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together
in this lowly environment; and here they had found
peace, the first that the tired woman had known since childhood.
The sudden culmination of those mental forces which
had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim and a
score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
to a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.
Even Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment
of his relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated
<i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i>. But when he had sufficiently digested
the newspaper accounts wherein were set forth in unsparing
detail the base rumors of the girl&rsquo;s parentage and of her removal
from a brothel before her sudden elevation to social
heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down
to the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny. Whence
had come this tale, which even the girl could not refute? From
Lafelle? He had sailed for Europe&ndash;&ndash;though but a day before.
Ketchim? The man was cringing like a craven murderer in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_6' name='book4_page_6'></a>6</span>
cell, for none dared give him bail. Reed? Harris? Was it
revenge for his own sharp move in regard to La Libertad? He
would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy hands upon
the guilty ones! The editors of the great newspapers, perhaps?
Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every
editor in the city. But they were perfectly safe, for the girl,
although she told a straightforward story, could not say positively
that the published statements concerning her were false.
Yet, though few knew it, there were two city editors and several
reporters who, in the days immediately following, found it
convenient to resign their positions and leave the city before
the awful wrath of the powerful man.</p>
<p>Then Ames turned upon his wife. And, after weeks of
terror, that browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the
terrible persecution of her relentless master, fled secretly,
with her terrified daughter, to England, whither the stupified
Duke of Altern and his scandalized mother had betaken themselves
immediately following the expos&eacute;. Thereupon Ames&rsquo;s
lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion, and laid
it before the judge who fed from his master&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie
fire over the dry, withering stalks of the smart set. He vowed
he would take Carmen and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable
character-assassins who had sought her ruin! He swore
he would support her with his untold millions and force society
to acknowledge her its queen! He had it in his power to
wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious dame in
the entire clique! He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette. The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the
subtle machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts. Then,
as a telling example to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors
of the Lunacy Commission, and rested not until that body had
condemned his victim to a living death in a state asylum.
Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and concentrated their
guns upon their common enemy. The Beaubien alone stood
out against him for three months. Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs. Hawley-Crowles,
she hid the girl so completely that Ames was effectually
balked in his attempts at drastic vindication in her behalf.</p>
<p>But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon
turned its full force upon the lone woman. Driven to desperation,
she stood at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining
weapon. Again the social set was rent, and this time by the
report that the black cloud of bigamy hung over Ames. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_7' name='book4_page_7'></a>7</span>
a fat season for the newspapers, and they made the most of
it. As a result, several of them found themselves with libel
suits on their hands. The Beaubien herself was confronted
with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she
had but the latter&rsquo;s word for the charge, and that, years since,
in a moment of maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to
her that, as far as he knew, the wife of his youth was still
living. The suit went against her. Ames then took his heavy
toll, and retired within himself to sulk and plan future assaults
and reprisals.</p>
<p>The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up
the scant remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her
effects, and withdrew to the outskirts of the city. She would
have left the country, but for the fact that the tangled state of
her finances necessitated her constant presence in New York
while her lawyers strove to bring order out of chaos and placate
her raging persecutor. To flee meant complete abandonment of
her every financial resource to Ames. And so, with the assistance
of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall, who placed themselves
at once under her command, she took a little house, far
from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed thither
with Carmen.</p>
<p>One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her
door. Carmen saw the caller and fled into her arms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Jude!&rdquo; she cried joyously.</p>
<p>The woman had come to return the string of pearls which
the girl had thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity
Ball. Nobody knew she had them. She had not been able to
bring herself to sell them. She had wanted&ndash;&ndash;oh, she knew not
what, excepting that she wanted to see again the girl whose
image had haunted her since that eventful night when the
strange child had wandered into her abandoned life. Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would
have believed her, a prostitute? And&ndash;&ndash;but the radiant girl
gathered her in her arms and would not let her go without a
promise to return.</p>
<p>And return she did, many times. And each time there was
a change in her. The Beaubien always forced upon her a little
money and a promise to come back. It developed that Jude was
cooking in a cheap down-town restaurant. &ldquo;Why not for us,
mother, if she will?&rdquo; asked Carmen one day. And, though the
sin-stained woman demurred and protested her unworthiness,
yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly, and she
yielded at length, with her heart bursting.</p>
<p>Then, in her great joy, Carmen&rsquo;s glad cry echoed through
the little house: &ldquo;Oh, mother dear, we&rsquo;re free, we&rsquo;re free!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_8' name='book4_page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>But the Beaubien was not free. Night after night her sleepless
pillow was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing
angel stood before her and relentlessly revealed each
act of shameful meanness, of cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality
in her wasted life. And, lastly, the weight of her
awful guilt in bringing about the destruction of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles
lay upon her soul like a mountain. Oh, if she had
only foreseen even a little of it! Oh, that Carmen had come to
her before&ndash;&ndash;or not at all! And yet she could not wish that
she had never known the girl. Far from it! The day of judgment
was bound to come. She saw that now. And, but for
the comforting presence of that sweet child, she had long since
become a raving maniac. It was Carmen who, in those first
long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse, wound her soft
arms about the Beaubien&rsquo;s neck, as she lay tossing in mental
agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new!&rdquo; It was
Carmen who whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath,
and of the mercy reflected by him who, though on the cross,
forgave mankind because of their pitiable ignorance. It is
ignorance, always ignorance of what constitutes real good,
that makes men seek it through wrong channels. The Beaubien
had sought good&ndash;&ndash;all the world does&ndash;&ndash;but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it
until they reflect Him. And so she had &ldquo;missed the mark.&rdquo;
Oh, sinful, mesmerized world, ye shall find Me&ndash;&ndash;the true good&ndash;&ndash;only
when ye seek Me with all your heart! And yet, &ldquo;I, even
I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
sake, and will not remember thy sins.&rdquo; Only a God who is
love could voice such a promise! And Carmen knew; and she
hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.</p>
<p>Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.
The Beaubien would live&ndash;&ndash;yes, but not for herself. Nay, that
life had gone out forever, nor would mention of it pass her
lips again. The Colombian revolution&ndash;&ndash;her mendacious connivances
with Ames&ndash;&ndash;her sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice&ndash;&ndash;aye,
the door was now closed against that, absolutely and
forever more. She had passed through the throes of a new
birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish; but she
rose stripped of her worldly strength. Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.</p>
<p>And Carmen&ndash;&ndash;what had been her thought when foul calumny
laid its sooty touch upon her? What had been the working
of her mind when that world which she had sought to
illumine with the light of her own purity had cast her out?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_9' name='book4_page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once
against every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion
of defeat, of loss, of dishonor. The arrows of malice,
as well as those of self-pity and condemnation, snapped and
fell, one by one, as they hurtled vainly against the whole
armor of God wherewith the girl stood clad. Self sank into
service; and she gathered the bewildered, suffering Beaubien
into her arms as if she had been a child. She would have gone
to Ames, too, had she been permitted&ndash;&ndash;not to plead for mercy,
but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more
than the Beaubien herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul had been a murderer,&rdquo; she often said, as she sat in
the darkness alone with the suffering woman and held her
trembling hand. &ldquo;But he became the chief of apostles. Think
of it! When the light came, he shut the door against the past.
If he hadn&rsquo;t, dearest, he never could have done what he did.
And you, and Mr. Ames, will have to do the same.&rdquo; And this
the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of soul-racking
struggle. But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by the
foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall,
and bury him fathoms deep.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them
stanchly. And likewise had Elizabeth Wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just longed
for some reasonable excuse to become a social outcast,&rdquo; the
latter had said, as she was helping Carmen one day to pack
her effects prior to removing from the Hawley-Crowles mansion.
&ldquo;I long for a hearthstone to which I can attach myself&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then attach yourself to ours!&rdquo; eagerly interrupted Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; declared Miss Wall. &ldquo;For I know that now you
are really going to live&ndash;&ndash;and I want to live as you will. Moreover&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She paused and smiled queerly at the girl&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I am
quite in love with your hero, Father Waite, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for
Denver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to hustle for a living now,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s me for the mountains once more! New York is no
place for such a tender lamb as I. Oh, I&rsquo;ve been well trimmed&ndash;&ndash;but
I know enough now to keep away from this burg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the
front door of the little bungalow, followed immediately by the
entrance of the manager of a down-town vaudeville house. He
plunged at once into his errand. He would offer Carmen one
hundred dollars a week, and a contract for six months, to appear
twice daily in his theater. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make a roar!&rdquo; he asserted.
&ldquo;Heavens, Madam! but she did put it over the society
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_10' name='book4_page_10'></a>10</span>
ginks.&rdquo; And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful proposal,
was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.</p>
<p>Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce
himself as one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return
there in the not distant future, where he would be glad to do
what he might to remove the stain which had been laid upon
the name of the fair girl. The genuineness of the man stood
out so prominently that the Beaubien took him at once into her
house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;Cartagena! Why, I wonder&ndash;&ndash;do you
know Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A priest who once taught there in the University, many
years ago? And who was sent up the river, to Simit&iacute;? Yes,
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment
was begun a friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time
bore richest fruit. It soon became known that Hitt was giving
a course of lectures that fall in the University, covering the
results of his archaeological explorations; so Carmen and
Father Waite went often to hear him. And the long breaths
of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled stimulated a
desire for more. Besides, Father Waite had some time before
announced his determination to study there that winter, as
long as his meager funds would permit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take up law,&rdquo; he had one day said. &ldquo;It will open
to me the door of the political arena, where there is such great
need of real men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism,
and morality. I shall seek office&ndash;&ndash;not for itself, but for
the good I can do, and the help I can be in a practical way
to my fellow-men. I have a little money. I can work my way
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the
Beaubien&rsquo;s permission, applied for admittance to the great
halls of learning, and was accepted.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt
and his friend had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen,
Elizabeth Wall had driven up in her car to take the girl for a
ride, but had yielded to the urgent invitation to join the little
conference, &ldquo;my plan, in which I invite you to join, is, briefly,
<i>to study this girl</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank
amazement, as Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.
Nor were the others less astonished&ndash;&ndash;all but the Beaubien.
She nodded her head comprehendingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_11' name='book4_page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; Father Waite continued. &ldquo;We are assembled
here to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of
very diversified lines of human thought. I will begin with
myself. I have stood as the embodiment of Christly claims,
as the active agent of one of the mightiest of human institutions,
the ancient Christian Church. For years I have studied
its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive assumptions, which
embrace heaven, earth, and hell. For years I sought with sincere
consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity. I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries,
through heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down
through schisms and subsequent decline, to the present hour,
when the great system seems to be gathering its forces for a
life and death stand in this, the New World. I have known
and associated with its dignitaries and its humble priests. I
know the policies and motives underlying its quiet movements.
I found it incompatible with human progress. And so I withdrew
from it my allegiance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s thought, as she listened, was busy with another
whose experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom
the human coils had been too tightly wound to be so easily
broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our scholarly friend, Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; Father Waite went on,
&ldquo;represented the great protest against the abuses and corruption
which permeated the system for which I stood. He, like
myself, embodied the eternal warfare of the true believer
against the heretic. Yet, without my churchly system, I was
taught to believe, he and those who share his thought are
damned. But, oh, strange anomaly! we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as
Love. We were two brothers of the same great family, yet
calling each other <i>anathema</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked over at Hitt and smiled. &ldquo;And to-day,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;we brothers are humbly meeting on the common
ground of failure&ndash;&ndash;failure to understand the Christ, and to
meet the needs of our fellow-men with our elaborate systems of
theology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession,&rdquo;
said Hitt reflectively. &ldquo;I would he were here to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here, in spirit,&rdquo; replied Father Waite; &ldquo;for the same
spirit of eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates
us no doubt moved him. I have reason to think so,&rdquo;
he added, looking at Carmen. &ldquo;For this girl&rsquo;s spiritual development
I believe to be very largely his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt glanced at Carmen inquiringly. He knew but little as
yet of her past association with the priest Jos&egrave;.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_12' name='book4_page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You and I, Mr. Hitt, represented the greatest systems of
so-called Christian belief,&rdquo; pursued Father Waite. &ldquo;Madam
Beaubien, on the other hand, has represented the world that
waits, as yet vainly, for redemption. We have not been able
to afford it her. Yet&ndash;&ndash;pardon my frankness in thus referring
to you, Madam. It is only to benefit us all&ndash;&ndash;that the means of
redemption <i>have</i> been brought to her, we must now admit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All turned and looked at Carmen. She started to speak,
but Father Waite raised a detaining hand. &ldquo;Let me proceed,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Miss Wall represents the weariness of spirit and unrest
abroad in the world to-day, the spirit that finds life not
worth the while; and Mr. Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief,
the agnosticism, of that great class who can not accept
the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems of theology, yet who
have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or epicureanism to
offer in substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd bowed and smiled. &ldquo;You have me correctly classified,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Yankee, and from Missouri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, having placed us,&rdquo; said the Beaubien, &ldquo;how
will you classify Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Waite looked at the girl reverently. &ldquo;Hers is the
leaven,&rdquo; he replied gently, &ldquo;which has leavened the whole lump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friends,&rdquo; he went on earnestly, &ldquo;like all priests
and preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity&rsquo;s
troubles. I have longed and prayed to know how to do
the works which Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed
or the couch of death, what could I do&ndash;&ndash;I, to whom the
apostolic virtue is supposed to have descended in the long line
of succession? I could anoint with holy oil. I could make
signs, and pray. I could give promises of remitted sins&ndash;&ndash;though
I knew I spoke not truth. I could comfort by voicing
the insipid views of our orthodox heaven. And yet I know
that what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify
until death might end the suffering. Is that serving Christ?
Is that Christianity? Alas, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you were a good orthodox priest,&rdquo; interposed Haynerd,
&ldquo;you would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from
your communion table all who were not of your faith, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sadly. &ldquo;I would have to, were I consistent; for
Catholicism is the only true faith, founded upon the revealed
word of God, you know.&rdquo; He smiled pathetically as he looked
around at the little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you, Mr. Haynerd, are a man of the
world. You are not in sympathy with the Church. You are
an infidel, an unbeliever. And therefore are you &lsquo;<i>anathema</i>,&rsquo;
you know.&rdquo; He laughed as he went on. &ldquo;But you can not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_13' name='book4_page_13'></a>13</span>
deny that at times you think very seriously. And, I may go
farther: you long, intensely, for something that the world does
not offer. Now, what is it but truth that you are seeking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; answered Haynerd quickly. &ldquo;I want to
be shown. I am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and
jugglery. But the priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform
a biscuit into the flesh of a man dead some two thousand
years, and a bit of grape juice into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!
And so does the jugglery by which your Protestant
fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile their opposite beliefs.
Why, what difference can it possibly make to the Almighty
whether we miserable little beings down here are baptised with
water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed, sprinkled,
or well soused? Good heavens! for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials. Isn&rsquo;t
it time to get down to business, and instead of burning at the
stake every one who differs with you, try conscientiously to
put into practice a few of the simple moral precepts, such as
the Golden Rule, and loving one&rsquo;s neighbor as one&rsquo;s self?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; commented Father Waite, &ldquo;you have a bit of the
world&rsquo;s opinion of the Church! Can we say that the censure
is not just? Would not Christ himself to-day speak even more
scathingly to those who advocate a system of belief that puts
blinders on men&rsquo;s minds, and then leads them into the pit of
ignorance and superstition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye have taken away the key of knowledge,&rdquo; murmured
Carmen; &ldquo;ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
entering in ye hindered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood
as a living protest against all that hampers the expansion of
the human mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its
enlarging and ever nobler concept of God. &ldquo;Now I want to
know, first, if there is a God; and, if so, what He is, and what
His relation is to me. I want to know what I am, and why I
am here, and what future I may look forward to, if any. I
don&rsquo;t care two raps about a God who can&rsquo;t help me here on
earth, who can&rsquo;t set me right and make me happy&ndash;&ndash;cure my
ills, meet my needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.
And if there is a God, and we can meet Him only by dying,
then why in the name of common sense all this hullabaloo
about death? Why, in that case, death is the grandest thing in
life! And I&rsquo;m for committing suicide right away! But you
preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail. You&rsquo;re scared
stiff when you contemplate it. You make Christianity just a
grand preparation for death. Yet it isn&rsquo;t the gateway to life
to you, and you know it! Then why, if you are honest, do
you tell such rubbish to your trusting followers?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_14' name='book4_page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I would remind you,&rdquo; returned Hitt with a little laugh,
&ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, friends,&rdquo; interposed Father Waite, &ldquo;it is to take up
for earnest consideration just such questions as Mr. Haynerd
propounds, that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that
we meet together once or twice a week, or as often as we may
agree upon, to search for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; his voice dropped to a whisper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to
search for God, and with this young girl as our guide. For
I believe she is very close to Him. The world knows God
only by hearsay. Carmen has <i>proved</i> Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men ask why it is,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that God remains hidden
from them; why they can not understand Him. They forget
that Jesus revealed God as Love. And, if that is so, in order
to know Him all mankind must love their fellow-men. But
they go right on hating one another, cheating, abusing, robbing,
slaying, persecuting, and still wondering why they don&rsquo;t
know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever working
out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe
that Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported.&rdquo; He
paused and reflected for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient prophet said: &lsquo;Ye shall seek me, and find me,
when ye shall search for me with all your hearts.&rsquo; It is my
proposal that we bind ourselves together in such a search. To
it we can bring diverse talents. To our vast combined worldly
experience, I bring knowledge of the ancient Greek and Latin
Fathers, together with Church history. Mr. Hitt brings his
command of the Hebrew language and history, and an intimate
acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical interpretation,
together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences. Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr. Haynerd contribute
their earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge
of the world&rsquo;s needs. Moreover, we all come together
without bias or prejudice. And Carmen&ndash;&ndash;she contributes that
in which we have all been so woefully lacking, and without
which we can <i>never</i> know God, the rarest, deepest spirituality.
She is a living proof of her faith. Shall we undertake the
search, my friends? It means a study of her thought, and the
basis upon which it rests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes. She was
thinking of that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to
meet nightly in her magnificent mansion to prey upon their
fellows. Oh, how different the spirit of this little gathering!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will meet here, with me,&rdquo; she said in a broken voice.
&ldquo;I ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of
this penitent, broken woman. Each rose in turn and clasped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_15' name='book4_page_15'></a>15</span>
her hand. Carmen threw her arms about her neck and kissed
her repeatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears,
&ldquo;what this child&rsquo;s religion is? Would the swinging of incense
burners and the mumbling of priestly formul&aelig; enhance it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said, &lsquo;Having seen me ye have seen God,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Father Waite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say,&rdquo; replied the Beaubien, &ldquo;that having seen this
child, you have indeed seen Him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite
were wending their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings
later, &ldquo;that this Carmen is the kind of girl you read
about in sentimental novels; the kind who are always just
ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in the warfare
and struggle of actual mundane existence. You get me?
She isn&rsquo;t quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would
say of an impossible heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake, my friend,&rdquo; replied Father Waite warmly.
&ldquo;She is the very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the
belief that years bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the
little child is crushed beneath a load of false beliefs and human
laws that make it reflect its mortal parents, rather than its
heavenly one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to see her under stress&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under stress! Good heavens, man! You haven&rsquo;t the
slightest conception of the stress she&rsquo;s been under most of her
life! But your criticism unconsciously pays her the highest
tribute, for her kind never show by word, deed, or look what
they are enduring. That frail-appearing girl has stood up under
loads that would have flattened you and me out like gold leaf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she doesn&rsquo;t look it!&rdquo; protested Haynerd tenaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she doesn&rsquo;t! Her kind never do! She&rsquo;s so far
and away ahead of mortals like you and me that she doesn&rsquo;t
admit the reality and power of evil&ndash;&ndash;and, believe me, she&rsquo;s got
her reasons for not admitting it, too! Don&rsquo;t presume to judge
her yet. Only try humbly to attain a little of her understanding
and faith; and try to avoid making yourself ridiculous by
criticising what you do not comprehend. That, indeed, has
been mankind&rsquo;s age-long blunder&ndash;&ndash;and they have thereby made
asses of themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Haynerd, or &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; as he was invariably known,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_16' name='book4_page_16'></a>16</span>
prided himself on being something of a philosopher. And in
the name of philosophy he chose to be quixotic. That one who
hated the dissimulations and shams of our class aristocracy
so cordially should have earned his livelihood&ndash;&ndash;and a good
one, too&ndash;&ndash;as publisher of the Social Era, a sprightly weekly
chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would have appeared
anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek sophistries
and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots. Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered
fellow, doomed to be loved, and by the same graces
thoroughly cheated by the world in general. He had in his
rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped deeply into things
mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering and blowing,
with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths. Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was
a poor way of serving the Lord, and turned cynic. His wit
was his saving grace. It was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.
By it he won a place for himself in the newspaper
world, and later, as a credit asset, had employed it successfully
in negotiating for the Social Era. It taking over the
publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was altogether
too short to permit of attempting anything worth while;
and so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame&ndash;&ndash;assuming
that he had ever done so&ndash;&ndash;but settled comfortably
down to the enjoyment of his sinecure. He had never married.
And as justification for his self-imposed celibacy he pompously
quoted Kant: &ldquo;I am a bachelor, and I could not cease to be a
bachelor without a disturbance that would be intolerable to
me.&rdquo; Yet he was not a misogynist. He simply shirked responsibility
and ease-threatening risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pseudo-litt&eacute;rateur&ndash;&ndash;I conduct a &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s It?&rsquo; for
the quidnunces of this blas&eacute; old burg. And I really meet a
need by furnishing an easy method of suicide, for my little
vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror, that all who look therein
may die of laughter. By the way, I had to run those base
squibs about you; but, by George! I&rsquo;m going to make a retraction
in next Saturday&rsquo;s issue. I&rsquo;ll put a crimp in friend Ames
that&rsquo;ll make him squeal. I&rsquo;ll say he has ten wives, and eight
of &rsquo;em Zulus, at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please!&rdquo; laughed Carmen. &ldquo;We have enough to
meet, without going out of our way to stir up more. Let it all
work out now, as it will, in the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the right way, eh? Is that part of your doctrine? Say,
don&rsquo;t you think that in formulating a new religion you&rsquo;re
carrying coals to Newcastle? Seems to me we&rsquo;ve got enough
now, if we&rsquo;d practice &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_17' name='book4_page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My religion, Mr. Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings
of a Nazarene Jew, named Jesus,&rdquo; she replied gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; she quickly returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thorough Socialist.
So we meet on common ground, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; She held
out her hand, and he took it, a puzzled expression coming into
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, glancing about, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to dispute that
later. I see Father Waite is about to open this little religious
seminar. But we&rsquo;ll get back to the discussion of myself,&rdquo; he
added, his eyes twinkling. &ldquo;For, like Thoreau, I prefer to
discuss that subject, because there&rsquo;s no other about which I
know so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor so little,&rdquo; she added, laughing and squeezing his hand
as she turned from him.</p>
<p>The little coterie took their places around the dining room
table, which was well strewn with books of reference and
writing materials. Father Waite rapped gently for order. A
deep, reverent silence fell upon the group. They had begun
their search for God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; began Father Waite slowly, &ldquo;we are inaugurating
to-night a mission of the most profound significance. No
question so vitally touches the human race as the one which
we shall reverently discuss in this and subsequent meetings.
I thought as I came in here to-night of the wisdom of Epictitus,
who said, &lsquo;What do I want? To acquaint myself with the
true order of things and comply with it.&rsquo; I am sure no statement
so fully expresses our common desire as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; interrupted Haynerd. &ldquo;If Adam was a Baptist,
I want to know and comply with the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh followed. Then Father Waite held up a
hand and again became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider
how much misery and rancor its literal acceptance has
caused among mankind? No. Out of deepest sympathy for
a world in search of truth, let us pity their stumblings, and
take heed that we fall not ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. A hush lay upon the room. Carmen&rsquo;s hand
stole toward the Beaubien&rsquo;s and clasped it tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these days, as of old, it is still said, &lsquo;There is no God!&rsquo;
And yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind&rsquo;s
very existence is a function of their concept of a
Creator, a sole cause of all that is. No question, economic,
social, political, or other, is so vitally related to humanity as
this: &lsquo;Is there a God?&rsquo; And the corollary: &lsquo;What is His relation
to me?&rsquo; For there can be nothing so important as a knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_18' name='book4_page_18'></a>18</span>
of truth. Can the existence of a God be demonstrated?
Can He be shown to be beneficent, in view of the world&rsquo;s testimony?
What is our source of truth? If the Bible, then can
its authenticity be established? The greatest of our so-called
civilizations are known as Christian. But who can say by them
what Christianity really is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite prepared to say what it is not!&rdquo; again interrupted
Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; resumed Father Waite. &ldquo;And so are we all.
But at present we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely
destructive. There has been quite enough of that sort in the
world. But, to go a step further, can we say positively that
the truth is to be found even in Christianity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please explain your question,&rdquo; said Miss Wall, with a
puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first essential is always facts,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The
deduction of right conclusions will follow&ndash;&ndash;provided, as Matthew
Arnold so tersely said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception,
subtlety, wisdom, and tact. And, I may add, sufficient
freedom from prejudice and mental bias&ndash;&ndash;ah, there is the
stumbling block!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matthew Arnold,&rdquo; ventured Haynerd, &ldquo;was dubbed a first-class
infidel, as I recall it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless. As have been many of the world&rsquo;s most earnest
searchers. Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are
acknowledging. But, to resume, since Christianity as we know
it is based upon the personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can
the historicity of Jesus be established?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Do you mean: did he ever live?&rdquo; queried Miss
Wall in greater surprise than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call
the Gospels? Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?
And, lastly, has that truth been correctly transmitted to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Hitt, &ldquo;there is still the question: Assuming
that he gave us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the
meeting of our daily needs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point is well taken,&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;For,
though I may know that there are very abstruse mathematical
principles, yet I may be utterly unable to demonstrate or use
them. But now,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we are brought to other vital
questions concerning us. They are, I think, points to which
the theologian has given but scant thought. If we conclude
that there is a God, we are confronted with the material universe
and man. Did He create them? And what are their
natures and import?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd. &ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;ve cut out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_19' name='book4_page_19'></a>19</span>
a large assignment for this little party. Those are questions
that the world has played football with for thousands of years.
Do you think we can settle them in a few evenings&rsquo; study? I
think I&rsquo;ll be excused!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! We can&rsquo;t spare you,&rdquo; laughed Father Waite. Then
he glanced at Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing,
during the remarks. &ldquo;I think you will hear things soon
that will set you thinking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But now we are going to
let our traveled friend, Mr. Hitt, give us just a word in summation
of his thought regarding the modern world and its attitude
toward the questions which we have been propounding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his
customary attitude when in deep thought. All eyes turned
upon him in eager expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; he began reflectively, &ldquo;presents to me to-day
the most interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.
True, the age is one of great mental confusion. Quite as true,
startling discoveries and astounding inventions have so upset
our staid old mediaeval views that the world is hurriedly
crowding them out, together with its God. Doctrines for which
our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly tossed upon the
ash heap. The searchlight is turned never so mercilessly upon
the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the manuscripts
which relate his words and deeds. Yet most of us
have grown so busy&ndash;&ndash;I often wonder with what&ndash;&ndash;that we have
no time for that which can not be grasped as we run. We
work desperately by day, building up the grandest material
fabric the world has ever seen; and at night we repair the
machine for the next day&rsquo;s run. Even our college professors
bewail the lack of time for solid reading and research. And if
our young pursue studies, it is with the almost exclusive
thought of education as a means of earning a material livelihood
later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage. It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low
ebb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes
upward to the ceiling as he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does
not often speak the name of God. Not that we are so much
irreverent as that we feel no special need of Him in our daily
pursuits. Since we ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai,
and their lingering echoes in bulls and heresy condemnations,
we find that we get along just as well&ndash;&ndash;indeed, much better.
And it really is quite bad form now to speak continually of
God, or to refer to Him as anything real and vital. To be on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_20' name='book4_page_20'></a>20</span>
such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen is&ndash;&ndash;in
thought, at least&ndash;&ndash;would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors
an opportunity for comment. Then, as the silence remained
unbroken, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved
remarkable success in applying the knout to superstition and
limitation. But, like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept
out much that is essential with the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. When spirituality
ceases to be real or vital to a people, then a grave danger
threatens them. Materiality has never proved a blessing, as
history shows. Life that is made up of strain and ceaseless
worry is not life. The incessant accumulation of material
wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.
To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide. The increased hankering after physical excitements
and animal pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search
for that which is real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross,
mesmeric stupidity, to say the least. It shows that our sense of
life is awry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the world is surely attempting its own betterment,&rdquo;
protested Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant you that,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;But legislation and
coercion are the wrong means to employ. They restrain, but
they do not cure. They are only narcotics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the
individual himself changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I disputed that?&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;Quite the contrary,
that is the pith of my observations. Reform is a hearthside
affair. And no sane man will maintain that general reform
can ever come until the individual&rsquo;s needs are met&ndash;&ndash;his daily,
hourly, worldly needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I get your point,&rdquo; said Father Waite. &ldquo;It is wholly
a question of man&rsquo;s concept of the cause of things, himself
included, and their purpose and end, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;The restless spirit of the modern
world is hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith
which has no other basis than blind belief. It wants demonstrable
fact upon which to build. In plain words, <i>mankind
would be better if they but knew how</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we show them how,&rdquo; asserted Haynerd. &ldquo;But they
don&rsquo;t do as we tell &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure that you show them how?&rdquo; asked Hitt.
&ldquo;What do you ever do toward showing them how permanently
to eradicate a single human difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_21' name='book4_page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so, my friend. The relief we afford is but temporary.
And so the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in
a life beyond the grave. But now, returning to our survey, let
me say that amid all the folly of vain pursuits, of wars and
strife, of doleful living and pitiable dying, there are more encouraging
and hopeful signs hung out to the inquiring thought
to-day than ever before in history. If I misread not, we are
already entered upon changes so tremendous that their end
must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and hence
of life. Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights. I
doubt if there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness
of the pleasures of the flesh. I doubt if ever there was
such a quickening of the business conscience, and such a
determined desire to introduce honesty and purity into our
dealings with one another. Never was the need of religion
more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and that is
why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief, however
eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing
the promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here
this side of the grave. The world was never so hungry for
religious truth; and this fact is a perpetual challenge to the
Church. There is a tremendous world-yearning to know and
to do better. And what is its cause? I answer, a growing
appreciation of the idea that &lsquo;the kingdom of harmony is within
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said that,&rdquo; murmured Carmen, looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there
was an influence for better things always existent in the ancient
Jews, that &lsquo;something not ourselves,&rsquo; if you will, &lsquo;that makes
for righteousness.&rsquo; And he showed that that influence could
be outwardly externalized in freedom from the ills which beset
humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; put in Haynerd. &ldquo;And then, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;something not ourselves&rsquo; is the germ of the true
idea of God,&rdquo; answered Hitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which makes God&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wholly mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; offered Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The terms are synonymous,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;And now let me
conclude with a final observation. Mankind&rsquo;s beliefs are in a
whirl. Ecclesiasticism is dying. Orthodoxy and conservatism
are hanging desperately to the world&rsquo;s flying skirts, but they
will eventually drop off. No change in thought has been greater
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_22' name='book4_page_22'></a>22</span>
than that concerning God. The absentee Lord who started the
universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap, with
the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.
The idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His
creation and temporarily set aside His own laws to convince
puny man of His greatness, is likewise obsolescent. The world
is slowly growing into a conception of a creator, of some kind,
but at least mental, and universally present. Nay, more, available
for all our problems and needs. And the end will be the
adoption of that conception, enlarged and purified still further,
and taken into the minutest affairs of our daily life&ndash;&ndash;as this
girl has done. The day of patient suffering in this world, under
the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the heavenly
future, has all but passed. We are gradually becoming conscious
of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is <i>right here within us</i>&ndash;&ndash;and therefore
can be naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly
attainable by humanity as the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; of Paul is laid off,
but not gained, necessarily, through what we call death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss
Wall. &ldquo;And what constitutes the &lsquo;old man&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Largely, I think,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;the belief that matter is
real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair.
&ldquo;Matter, real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;I stand on my statement,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought. &ldquo;History
shows,&rdquo; he said, meditatively, &ldquo;that man&rsquo;s progress has been
proportionate to his freedom from the limitation of ignorance
and undemonstrable belief. And that freedom has come as
man&rsquo;s concept of God has grown less and less material, and
more and more spiritual. From the animal nature of the
savage, to whom all is matter, down&ndash;&ndash;or up&ndash;&ndash;to the man of
to-day, to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency,
man&rsquo;s progress has been marked by a throwing off of limiting
beliefs, theological or other, in material power and substance.
The development of the least material forces, steam, electricity,
the X-ray, has come only as the human mind has thrown off
a portion of its hampering material beliefs. I am astounded
when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to future
generations! For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that
the creation itself must of necessity be <i>mental</i>. And from this
come such deductions as fairly make me tremble. Carmen has
told me of the deductions which her tutor, the priest Jos&egrave;, drew
from the single premise that the universe is infinite in extent&ndash;&ndash;a
premise which I think we all will accept.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_23' name='book4_page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no question about it,&rdquo; said Hitt, nodding his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Father Waite, &ldquo;that granted, we must
likewise grant its creator to be infinite, must we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.
The creator must be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no other conclusion,&rdquo; said Father Waite. &ldquo;But, that
granted, a flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs
and reasoning helter-skelter. For an infinite mind would
eventually disintegrate if it were not perfect in every part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that&rsquo;s what causes
the evil in the world,&rdquo; hazarded Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly untenable, my friend,&rdquo; put in Hitt. &ldquo;For, granted
an infinite mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such
a mind is of very necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.
What, then, could ever cause disintegration in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; resumed Father Waite. &ldquo;And such a
mind, of very necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course,
ever-present, must likewise be eternal. For there would be
nothing to contest its existence. Age, decay, and death would
be unknown to it. And so would evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Carmen, rising, &ldquo;is my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat
down, leaving the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking
off into unfathomed distances, and her face aglow with spiritual
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;And good includes all that is real. It includes wisdom,
intelligence, truth, life, and love&ndash;&ndash;none of them material. How
do I know? Oh, not by human reasoning, whereby you seek
to establish the fact of His existence, but by proof, daily proof,
and in the hours when the floods of suppositional evil have
swept over me. You would rest your faith on your deductions.
But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith where human
reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know. Yes, my God is Mind. And He ceaselessly expresses
Himself in and through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.
And He is infinite in good. And these ideas express
that goodness and infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of
God himself. And that grandest idea is&ndash;&ndash;man. Oh, no, not
the men and women you think you see about you in your
daily walk. No! no! They but counterfeit the divine. But the
man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_24' name='book4_page_24'></a>24</span>
That man is God&rsquo;s own idea of Himself. He is God&rsquo;s image
and likeness. He is God&rsquo;s reflection. That is the man we shall
all put on when we have obeyed Paul and put off the old man,
its counterfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Carmen,&rdquo; said Father Waite, &ldquo;you believe all things
to be mental?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything&ndash;&ndash;man himself&ndash;&ndash;and matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all
things. Hence He must include this imperfect representation,
called the physical man. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the girl emphatically. &ldquo;Did not Jesus speak
often of the one lie about his Father, God? The material man
and the material universe are but parts of that lie. And a lie
is always a supposition; not real. All evil is contained in that
supposition&ndash;&ndash;a supposition that there is power and life and
substance apart from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who made the supposition?&rdquo; queried Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A supposition is not made,&rdquo; replied Carmen quietly. &ldquo;Its
existence is suppositional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite get that,&rdquo; interposed Miss Wall, her brows
knitting.</p>
<p>Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;The creator of all things is mind. You admit that.
But you would have that mind the creator of evil, also. Yet,
your own reasoning has shown that, on the premise of mind
as infinite, such mind must be forever whole, harmonious,
perfect. The thoughts and ideas by which that mind expresses
itself must be likewise pure and perfect. Then that creative
mind can not create evil. For, a mind that creates evil must
itself be evil. And, being infinite, such a mind must include
the evil it creates. We would have, then, either a mind wholly
evil, or one of mixed evil and good. In either case, that mind
must then destroy itself. Am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reasoning is, certainly,&rdquo; admitted Miss Wall. &ldquo;But,
how to account for evil, when God is infinite good&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To account for it at all,&rdquo; replied Carmen, &ldquo;would be to
make it something real. Jesus would account for it only by
classing it as a lie about God. Now God, as the creative mind,
must likewise be truth, since He is perfection and harmony.
Very well, a lie is always the opposite of truth. Evil is the
direct opposite of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain
bright memories returned to him. &ldquo;That is what you told me
that day when I first talked with you. And it started a new line
of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it strange that God should have a suppositional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_25' name='book4_page_25'></a>25</span>
opposite?&rdquo; asked Carmen. &ldquo;Has not everything with which you are
concerned a suppositional opposite? God is truth. His suppositional
opposite is the great lie of evil. God is good. Hence
the same opposite. God is spirit. The suppositional opposite
is matter. And matter is just as mental as the thoughts which
you are now holding. God is real. Good is real. And so, evil
and the lie are unreal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The distinction seems to me theoretical,&rdquo; protested Miss
Wall.</p>
<p>Hitt then took the floor. &ldquo;That word &lsquo;real,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
perhaps what is causing your confusion. The real is that
which, according to Spencer, does not pass away. We used to
believe matter indestructible, forever permanent. We learn
that our views regarding it were very incorrect. Matter is quite
destructible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Father Waite, &ldquo;in this universe of constant
change, <i>something</i> endures. What is it but the mind that is
God, expressing itself in such immaterial and permanent
things as law, love, life, power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;But now we have been brought
back again to the question of matter. If we can prove that
matter is mental, and not real substance, we will have established
Carmen&rsquo;s premise that everything is mental. Then
there remains but the distinction between the mind that is
God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in human
existence. Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a
thing existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe,
being infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a
creator can not be infinite without being at once mind, perfect,
eternal, omnipotent, omniactive, and good, we are fully justified
in assuming that the creator of all things still exists, and
is infinite, ever-present mind. Further than that we are not
prepared to go, until we have discussed the questions of matter
and the physical universe and man. Let us leave those topics
for a subsequent meeting. And now I suggest that we unite
in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that has
marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, about the small upright piano which
the Beaubien had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in
reverent silence, while the young girl sent out through the
little room the harmonious expression of her own inner life,
the life that had never left heaven for earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
</div>
<p>With her exit from the <i>beau monde</i> and her entrance
upon the broad stage of University life, Carmen seemed
to have awakened from the lethargy which her abrupt
transition from mediaeval Simit&iacute; into the modern world had
occasioned. The static struggle to hold her own against the
rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in her
favor. Her lamp had been kept alight. The lethal influences
which rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of
fashion had been lifted and swept away by the fresher and
more invigorating breezes into which her bark had now been
drawn.</p>
<p>She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without
a deeper comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.
She knew that the University was but another stepping-stone,
even as her social life had been; another series of
calls and opportunities to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; her God to be immanent
good. And she thankfully accepted its offerings. For she was
keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of the &ldquo;higher education,&rdquo;
and she would stand as a living protest against them.</p>
<p>It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying
at the heart of so-called modern education. She had not been
slow to mark the disappointment written upon the faces of
many of her fellow-students, who had sought in vain a great
awakening light in those sacred precincts of learning, but, their
confidence betrayed, were now floundering in the devouring
morass of materialism. To her keen insight the University
stood revealed as the great panderer to this latest century&rsquo;s
obsessing idea that the true function of education is expressed
in the imparting of changing, human information and a training
for the business of earning one&rsquo;s daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world&rsquo;s carnal social system. The
University did not meet the most urgent need of the race by
equipping men to stand against the great crises of human
experience. It did not teach men to lay aside the counterfeit
man of material sense; but rather emphasized the world&rsquo;s belief
in the reality of this man by minutely detailed courses in
his mundane history and the manifestations of his pitiable
ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions. To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation. And
mankind&rsquo;s existence could find its only justification in ceaseless,
consecrated manifestation of His harmonious activity.
True, the University vaguely recognized God as infinitely competent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_27' name='book4_page_27'></a>27</span>
But in the same breath it confessed its utter ignorance
of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to know whom
alone is life. True, these men of worldly learning prayed. But
their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to
gain answers to them.</p>
<p>And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting
the call to &ldquo;come up higher.&rdquo; And meantime she strove to gain
daily a wider knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application
to the needs and problems of her fellow-men. Her
business was the reflection of her Father&rsquo;s business. Other
ambition she had none. The weak, transient, flighty, so-called
intellectual life which she saw about her sent no call across
the calm currents of her thought. Her education was religious
in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to know
God.</p>
<p>Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that
the notoriety which had been fastened upon her should mark
her as an object of curiosity, yet her story soon spread among
University circles, and the first semester was a scant two weeks
old before her name had been debated in the numerous Sororities
and Women&rsquo;s Clubs, and quietly dropped. Negro blood
coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental disgrace lay
dark upon her. She lived with a woman of blackened reputation&ndash;&ndash;a
reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial
strength had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.
If Carmen divined the comment that was passed concerning
herself, she gave no indication. But Hitt and Father
Waite knew that the girl had not found favor in the social and
fraternal organizations of her mates; and they knew why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curse upon such little minds!&rdquo; mused Hitt, when he
could no longer restrain himself. Then he called a student to
his desk one day, at the conclusion of his lecture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss West,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are leader in the most prominent
Sorority in the University. I want you to give Miss Carmen
Ariza a bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;She is not desirable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the charges against her are unfounded! They are
flagrantly false!&rdquo; stormed Hitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you proof, Professor?&rdquo; the girl asked, as she arched
her brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None definite. But&ndash;&ndash;well, what if she were a negress?
Hers is the most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, no. Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally
justified. What though the girl&rsquo;s skin vied with the lilies
and rosebuds? What though her hair was the brown of ripe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_28' name='book4_page_28'></a>28</span>
fields? Had not God Almighty decreed that the negro should
remain a drawer of water? A hewer of wood? Had the Lord
designed him the equal of the noble white, He would have
bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose. Miss West was a
Southerner. And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters
caused a little <i>moue</i> of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider
Carmen an eligible candidate for membership in her
Society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord above!&rdquo; ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over
the incident as he walked home with Father Waite. &ldquo;That
toadying, sycophantic, wealth-worshiping Miss West can see
no farther than the epidermis! If we could have maintained
Carmen&rsquo;s reputation as an Inca princess, this same girl would
have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge of her
robe! And she would have used every art of cajolery to ingratiate
herself into Carmen&rsquo;s favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Hitt,&rdquo; soothed Father Waite. &ldquo;Have you any
idea that Carmen is at all injured by Miss West&rsquo;s supercilious
conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo; asseverated Hitt vigorously. &ldquo;But it
makes me so&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, check that! You&rsquo;re forgetting the girl&rsquo;s influence,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat. &ldquo;Waite,&rdquo; he
blurted, &ldquo;that girl&rsquo;s an angel! She isn&rsquo;t real!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she is!&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so real that
we don&rsquo;t understand her&ndash;&ndash;so real that she has been totally
misunderstood by the petty minds that have sought to crush
her here in New York, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But certainly she is unique&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms
around people and telling them that she loves them. Yes, that
certainly is unique! And she is unique in that her purity and
goodness hang about her like an exquisite aura, and make people
instinctively turn and look after her as she passes. Unique
in that in her sweet presence one seems to hear a strain of
heavenly music vibrating on the air. So unique that the dawn,
the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset, fairly
intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Father Waite, &ldquo;she is so unique that when
the empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that
she had been thrown out of society because of the base rumor
regarding her parentage, sent her a written statement to the
effect that there was no engagement between them, and demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_29' name='book4_page_29'></a>29</span>
that she sign it, she did so, with a happy smile, with
an invocation, with a prayer for blessing upon those who had
tried to ruin her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! Did she do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, she did. And when Mrs. Hawley-Crowles and Ames
and Lafelle filched La Libertad from her, she would have
given them the clothes on her back with it, if they had demanded
them. Yes, she&rsquo;s unique&ndash;&ndash;so unique that again and
again I hear her murmur, as she looks off absently into space:
&lsquo;If it is right that he should have a son, then I want it to
be so.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to&ndash;&ndash;that priest&ndash;&ndash;Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, doubtless. And time and again I have heard her say:
&lsquo;God is light. Sight depends upon light. Therefore Anita&rsquo;s
babe sees.&rsquo; Old Rosendo&rsquo;s grandson, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt nodded. &ldquo;Waite,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;she is simply
illustrating what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves
wholly upon God&rsquo;s protecting care, and took our thoughts
only from Him. That&rsquo;s why she can lose her home, her family,
her reputation, that mine&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;and still stand. <i>She
does what we don&rsquo;t dare to do!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a living illustration,&rdquo; replied Father Waite, &ldquo;of the
mighty fact that there is nothing so practical as <i>real</i> Christianity.
I want you to tell Professor Cane that. He calls her
&lsquo;the girl with the Utopian views,&rsquo; because of her ingenuous
replies in his sociological class. But I want you to show him
that she is very far from being impractical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Hitt emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove to Cane that
her religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world
inhabited only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for
the every-day sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.
Moreover, Waite, she is a vivid illustration of the fact
that when the individual improves, the nation does likewise.
Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,&rdquo;
returned Father Waite gently.</p>
<p>Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth,
came and went, glad and happy. The change in her mode of
living from the supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion
to the common comforts of the home where now she dwelt
so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not to have caused even
a ripple in the full current of her joy. Her life was a
symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.
Often that autumn she might have been seen standing
among the tinted leaves on the college campus, and drinking in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_30' name='book4_page_30'></a>30</span>
their silent message. And then she might have been heard to
exclaim, as she turned her rapt gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad
buildings: &ldquo;Oh, I feel as if I just couldn&rsquo;t stand it, all this
wealth of beauty, of love, of boundless good!&rdquo; And yet she was
alone, always alone. For her dark story had reared a hedge
about her; the taboo rested upon her; and even in the crowded
classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked askance
and drew their skirts about them.</p>
<p>But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not. And
those like Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the
ability to peer into the depths of the girl&rsquo;s soul, took an immediate
and increasing interest in her. Often her own na&iuml;ve
manners broke down the bars of convention, and brought her
enduring friendships among the men of learning. This was
especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the School of
Surgery. Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the girl
one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with. Many odd sights
greeted her eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit
cases; but she met with no one until she chanced to open
the door of Doctor Morton&rsquo;s private laboratory, and found that
eminent man bending over a human brain, which he was dissecting.</p>
<p>Carmen stopped, and stood hesitant. The doctor looked up,
surprise written large upon his features as he noted his fair
caller. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, laying down his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; returned Carmen. &ldquo;That sounds like the Indian
&lsquo;How?&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Then both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;are&ndash;&ndash;Doctor Morton?&rdquo; queried the girl, twisting
around and looking at the name on the door to make certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the genial doctor, with growing interest. He
was a gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint,
and with keen, twinkling eyes. &ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned the girl; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to. I am Carmen
Ariza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. The young South American&ndash;&ndash;lady. I have heard
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most everybody seems to have heard of me,&rdquo; sighed the
girl. &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference about my coming in
here, does it?&rdquo; She looked up at him so wistfully that he felt
a great tug at his heartstrings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit!&rdquo; he replied cordially. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as welcome as the
April sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized his hand and pressed it. &ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; she said
eagerly, looking about. &ldquo;What are you doing? What&rsquo;s that
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_31' name='book4_page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, &ldquo;is the
brain of my erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.
He willed it to the University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, poor Yorick!&rdquo; murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle
coming into her eyes as she looked at it. &ldquo;And why are you
cutting it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interests of science,&rdquo; returned the man, studying
her. &ldquo;That we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous
mechanism of thought, and the laws by which it operates in
mental processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You think that this poor thing
held life, and you search now among its ashes for the living
principle. But, God is life; and &lsquo;Canst thou by searching find
out God?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man regarded her intently without replying. She bent
for a while over the half-dissected brain in deep thought. Then
she looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;life is not structural. God is life; and
to know Him is to reflect life. Reflecting Him, we are immortal.
Doctor, don&rsquo;t you think it is about time to do away with this
business of dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened
wider. The abrupt question quite swept him off his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t really expect to find anything in this brain, did
you?&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;The brain is composed of&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts,&rdquo; he
answered, wondering what the next question would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can a compound of water and a few commonplace
salts <i>think</i>?&rdquo; she asked, looking intently at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;no,&rdquo; he answered tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect,
is it not?&rdquo; she pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don&rsquo;t know. We
call it the organ of thought, because in some way thought
seems to be associated with it, rather than with&ndash;&ndash;well, with
the liver, or muscles, for example. And we learn that certain
classes of mental disturbances are intimately associated with
lesions or clots in the brain. That&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl reflected for a few moments. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, you wouldn&rsquo;t cut up a machine to discover the
motive power, would you? But that is just what you are
doing there with that brain. You are hoping by dissecting it
to find the power that made it go, aren&rsquo;t you? And the power
that made it go was mind&ndash;&ndash;life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the life is not in the brain now,&rdquo; hazarded the doctor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_32' name='book4_page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And never was,&rdquo; returned Carmen promptly. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;if the brain was ever alive, it could never cease
to be so. If it ever lived, it could never die. That brain never
manifested real life. It manifested only a false sense of life.
And that false sense died. Who or what says that the man
who owned that brain is dead? Why, the human mind&ndash;&ndash;human
belief. It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; The doctor regarded the girl queerly. She returned
his look with a confident smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe in evolution, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she at length continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely,&rdquo; he replied unhesitatingly. &ldquo;There is overwhelming
evidence of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved
first, the brain, or the mind which operates it and through
it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he replied meditatively, &ldquo;it is quite likely that they
evolved simultaneously, the brain being the mind&rsquo;s organ of
expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see, Doctor, that you are now making the
mind really come first? For that which expresses a thing is
always secondary to the thing expressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At any rate, it is quite immaterial
to a practical knowledge of how to meet the brain&rsquo;s
ills. I am a practical man, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Practical men
are so stupid and ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; he exclaimed, putting his hands on his
hips and staring down at the smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to think
you stupid and ignorant,&rdquo; she went on blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, that kind o&rsquo; takes the edge off your former
classification of me,&rdquo; he said, greatly amused, yet wondering
just what appraisal to place upon this frank girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And evolution,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is an unfolding, isn&rsquo;t it?
You see, the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.
Well, that mind expresses itself in its ideas. And these it is
unfolding all the time. Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional
opposite. The opposite of a fact is an error. And
that is why error has been called &lsquo;negative truth.&rsquo; Of course,
there isn&rsquo;t any such thing as negative truth! And so all error
is simply falsity, supposition, without real existence. Do you
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not reply. But she went on unperturbed. &ldquo;Now, the
human, or carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_33' name='book4_page_33'></a>33</span>
God. It is infinite mind&rsquo;s suppositional opposite. And it imitates
the infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.
And so the whole physical universe manifests evolution, too&ndash;&ndash;an
unfolding, or revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.
And all these manifest the human mind&rsquo;s sense of life,
and its equally strong sense of death. The universe, animals,
men, are all human types, evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in
the human mind. And all are the human mind&rsquo;s interpretations
of infinite mind&rsquo;s real and eternal and perfect ideas.
You see that, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;speaking of &lsquo;negative truth&rsquo;,
the first chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the
second chapter sets forth its opposite, negative truth. It is
very odd, isn&rsquo;t it? But there it is for everybody to read. And
the human mind, of course, true to its beliefs, clings to the
second chapter as the reality. Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, Carmen&rsquo;s attention had been attracted to a large
microscope that stood on the table near her. Going to it, she
peeped curiously down into the tube. &ldquo;Well, what have you
here?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germs,&rdquo; he said mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germs! What funny, twisted things! Well,&rdquo; she suddenly
asked, &ldquo;have you got the fear germ here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke into a laugh. But when the girl looked up, her
face was quite serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man,
but you haven&rsquo;t anything but fear germs under this glass,&rdquo; she
said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ
itself, which is mental,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;These things don&rsquo;t cause
disease,&rdquo; she went on, pointing to the slide. &ldquo;But the thoughts
which they manifest do. Do you scientists know why people
die, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted seriously. &ldquo;We really do not know why
people die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t know
enough to live.</i> This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn&rsquo;t
know that God was life. He committed sickness, and then paid
the penalty, death. He sinned by believing that there were
other powers than God, by believing that life and thought were
in matter. And so he paid the wages of sin, death. He simply
missed the mark, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and perched herself upon the table. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t asked me to sit down,&rdquo; she commented brightly. &ldquo;But,
if you don&rsquo;t mind, I will.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_34' name='book4_page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; the doctor exclaimed, coloring,
and hastily setting out a chair. &ldquo;I really was so interested in
what you were saying that I forgot my manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered
chair, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit here, so&rsquo;s I can look straight into your
eyes. You go ahead and cut up poor Yorick, and I&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor laughed again. &ldquo;You are much more interesting,&rdquo;
he returned, &ldquo;than poor Bolton, dead or alive. In fact,
he really was quite a bore. But you are like a sparkling mountain
rill, even if you do give me a severe classification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;then you are honestly more interested
in life than in death, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, most assuredly!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, much! Death is <i>such</i> a mistake; and I haven&rsquo;t
a bit of use for it,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like making mistakes
in music, or mathematics. Now when we make mistakes in
those, we never stop to discuss them. We correct them. But,
dear me! The world has nearly talked its poor old head off
about the mistakes of sickness and death. It never seems to
occur to the world that Jesus always associated sickness with
sin. You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit upon
a great truth, although they didn&rsquo;t make it really practical.
They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his
diseases until all his sins had been forgiven. And so they
attempted to forgive sins and make men clean by their elaborate
ceremonies. But they missed the mark, too. And nobody
got to the root of the difficulty until Jesus came. He forgave
sin by destroying it completely. And that cured the disease
that was the manifestation of sin. Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old
Rabbis did, and continue to treat the body&ndash;&ndash;the effect&ndash;&ndash;instead
of the mental cause? But,&rdquo; looking down in meditation, &ldquo;I
suppose if you did that the people would cry, &lsquo;He hath a devil!&rsquo;
They thought I was a witch in Simit&iacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;Then you do not believe that
disease is caused by microbes, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disease caused by microbes? Yes, so it is. And the microbe?
It is a manifestation of the human mind again. And,
as with typhoid fever, diphtheria, and other diseases, the human
mind applies its own cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods,
and then renders innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.
The human mind makes its own diseases, and then
in some cases removes the disease, but still by human, material
methods. Its reliefs are only temporary. At last it yields itself
to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls death.
It is all a mental process&ndash;&ndash;all human thought and its various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_35' name='book4_page_35'></a>35</span>
manifestations. Now why not get beyond microbes and reach
the cause, even of them, the human mind itself? Jesus did.
Paul did. Others have done so. Why do not you men of
science do likewise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out
for the girl. &ldquo;What you say,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;is not new
to me. But I can only answer that the world is not ready yet
for the great change which you suggest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What cant! What mesmerism you
are laboring under! Was the world ready for Jesus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He came too soon. Events show that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not
come before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not say. But&ndash;&ndash;I think he would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I quite agree with you,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;Now the
world has doctored for more than four thousand years, despite
the fact that health is not sold in bottle or pill form. Doctor,
what does the history of all these centuries of drugging show
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated. Carmen waited a moment; then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines
to cure disease?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Any more than putting men in
prison cures crime?&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They at least prove that medication has not <i>permanently</i>
removed disease,&rdquo; he ventured, not wishing to go too far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;that man Jesus, who, according
to you, came too soon, said: &lsquo;Without me ye can do
nothing.&rsquo; Well, didn&rsquo;t he come very, very close to the truth
when he made that statement? He did not say that without
drugs or material remedies we could do nothing, but that without
the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as before, to
miss the mark. He showed that disease and discord result
from sin. Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking
about things. It is wrong belief, false thought. Sin is mental.
Its effect, disease, is mental&ndash;&ndash;a state of discordant consciousness.
Can you with drugs change a state of mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied quickly. &ldquo;Whiskey and opium cause
changes in one&rsquo;s state of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But the human belief of power inherent
in whiskey and opium, or of the human body&rsquo;s reaction
to them, causes a change in the human thought-activity that is
called consciousness. The state of human consciousness
changes with the belief, but not the real state of mind. Can
you not see that? And Doctor Bolton&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolton was not sick. He died of natural causes, old age,
and general breakdown,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s refuge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_36' name='book4_page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table. &ldquo;What
an obstinately obdurate lot you scientific men are!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that you doctors are only a development
of the old &lsquo;medicine-man&rsquo;? Now in the first place, Mr.
Bolton isn&rsquo;t dead; and, in the second, there are no <i>natural</i>
causes of death. Old age? Why, that&rsquo;s gone out of fashion,
long since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deny senile changes&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny every human error!&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; with a note of banter in his voice, &ldquo;I take it that
you do not expect to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; she replied emphatically. &ldquo;I expect good, nothing
but good, ever! Don&rsquo;t you know that physiologists themselves
admit that the human body is composed of eighty-five
per cent water and fifteen per cent ordinary salts? Can such
a combination have intelligence and sensation? Do you still
believe that life is dependent upon lungs, stomach, or liver?
Why, the so-called &lsquo;unit cell&rsquo; breathes, digests, and manifests
life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no stomach,
no organs. It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and
power which it does <i>not</i> possess, that says the sense of life
shall depend upon such organs in the one case and not in the
other. And the human mind could be utterly refuted if men
would only learn to use the Christ-principle. Jesus and Paul
used it, and proved material laws to be only false beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied meditatively, &ldquo;if you are correct, then
the preachers are way off the track. And I have long since
come to the conclusion that&ndash;&ndash;Well,&rdquo; changing abruptly back
to the previous topic, &ldquo;so you refute the microbe theory, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I did and did not,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Listen: fear,
worry, hatred, malice, murder, all of which are mental things
in themselves, manifest to the human mind as microbes. These
are the hurtful microbes, and they produce toxins, which poison
the system. What is the cure? Antitoxins? No, indeed!
Jesus gave the real and permanent cure. It is the Christ-principle.
Now you can learn that principle, and how to apply it.
But if you don&rsquo;t care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and
death, until you are ready to leave them and turn to that which
is real. For all human-mind activity and manifestation,
whether in microbes, death, or life, is mental, and is but the
counterfeit of the real activity of divine mind, God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she pursued earnestly, &ldquo;I heard a lecture
the other day in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation
in the body. Well, as regards human life, I guess that is
so. For the human body is only a manifestation of the human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_37' name='book4_page_37'></a>37</span>
mind; and the human mind surely is in a continuous state of
ferment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and laughed. &ldquo;The lecturer,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;said that the range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and
that Shakespeare began as a single cell. Think of it! The
mundane concept of Shakespeare&rsquo;s body may have unfolded
from a cell-concept; but Shakespeare was a manifestation of
mind! And that mind was an interpretation, though very imperfect,
of the mind that is God. Why can&rsquo;t you materialists
raise your eyes above the dust? Why, you would choke the
very avenues of the spirit with mud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, your education seems to be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;my education is beyond the vagaries
that are so generally taught in the name of knowledge.
Intellectual education is a farce. It does nothing for mankind,
except to give them a false culture. Were the so-called great
men of the past really educated? Here is an extract which I
copied this afternoon from Hawthorne.&rdquo; She opened her note
book and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that Time
has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of his never-idle
fingers must be to steal them one by one away.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;was that man really educated? In
current theology, yes. But that theology <i>could not solve his
least earthly problem, nor meet his slightest need</i>! Oh, what
inexpressibly sad lives so many of your greatest men have lived!
Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they yearned for the rest
which they were taught was to follow death. They were the
victims of false theology. They were mesmerized. If they
believed in the Christ&ndash;&ndash;and they thought they did&ndash;&ndash;why, then,
did they not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?
He taught no such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!
He showed men how to overcome the world. Why do
we not try to overcome it? Has the time not come? Is the
world not sufficiently weary of dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her intently for some moments. She seemed,
as she stood there before him, like a thing of gossamer and
sunshine that had drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson
Moore! Pat and I have barked at each other for many years
now, and I&rsquo;m getting tired. I&rsquo;d like to shift him to a younger
and more vigorous opponent. I believe you&rsquo;ve been providentially
sent to relieve me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_38' name='book4_page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she acquiesced. &ldquo;You can tell Professor Hitt,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitt, eh? You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! He comes often to our house. He is very
much interested in these things that you and I have been talking
about to-day. We have regular meetings, with Father
Waite, and Mr. Haynerd, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no wonder you can argue! You&rsquo;ve had practice, it
seems. But&ndash;&ndash;suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your
meetings, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;And bring your Reverend Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently. &ldquo;I imagine
Reverend Pat wouldn&rsquo;t thank you for referring to him
that way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is a very high Anglican, and his
dignity is marvelous&ndash;&ndash;to say nothing of his self-esteem. Well,
we&rsquo;ll see, we&rsquo;ll see. But, don&rsquo;t go yet! We&rsquo;re just getting acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean to come
in here, you know. But I guess I was led, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat
silently beside the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade
and pondered long.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she
found the Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams,
of the University School of Music. That gentleman had learned
through Hitt of the girl&rsquo;s unusual voice, and had dropped in on
his way home to ask that he might hear and test it. With
only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books and hat upon
the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she launched
into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school
that day long gone, and which had been running in her thought
and seeking expression ever since her conversation with Doctor
Morton a short while before.</p>
<p>For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that
poured from her soul. Father Waite entered, and quietly took
a seat. She did not see him. Song after song, most of them
the characteristic soft melodies of her people, and many her
own simple improvisations, issued from the absorbed girl&rsquo;s
lips. The Beaubien rose and stole softly from the room.
Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving to
interpret the message which welled from the depths of his
own being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in
unison with those of this young girl.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_39' name='book4_page_39'></a>39</span>
faced her auditors. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, with a happy sigh, &ldquo;that
just <i>had</i> to come out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Williams rose and took her hand. &ldquo;Who, may I
ask, was your teacher?&rdquo; he said, in a voice husky with emotion.</p>
<p>Carmen smiled up at him. &ldquo;No human teacher,&rdquo; she said
gently.</p>
<p>A look of astonishment came into the man&rsquo;s face. He
turned to Father Waite inquiringly. The latter nodded his
confirmation of the girl&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor. &ldquo;I wonder if you realize
what you have got, Miss Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful gift, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;I had thought of asking you to let me train you&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I
dare not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.
May I&ndash;&ndash;may I send Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?
Will you sing for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned the girl; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing for anybody. The
gift isn&rsquo;t mine, you know. It is for all. I&rsquo;m only the channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the
Beaubien returned and handed Carmen a letter. With a cry
of joy the girl seized it and tore it open. It was from Colombia,
the second one that her beloved Rosendo had succeeded in
getting down the river to the distant coast. It had been written
three months prior, and it bore many stains and evidences of
the vicissitudes through which it had emerged. Yes, Rosendo
and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up the
Boque, with Don Nicol&aacute;s. The war raged below them, but they
were safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not a word from Padre Jos&egrave;, or about him,&rdquo; murmured
the girl, sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled
letter to her breast.</p>
<p>Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena,
and his possible share in the cause of Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s silence. But he
made no comment.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_4_1_1_1' id='CHAPTER_4_1_1_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>
</div>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s first serious test of her knowledge of English
composition was made early in the semester, in an essay
on town life in Colombia; and so meritorious did her instructor
consider it that he advised her to send it to a prominent
literary magazine. The result was that the essay was accepted,
and a request made for further contributions.</p>
<p>The girl bubbled with new-found happiness. Then she
wrote another, and still another article on the life and customs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_40' name='book4_page_40'></a>40</span>
of her people. Both were given publication; and with the
money which she received for them she bought a silk dress
for Jude, much to that adoring woman&rsquo;s surprise and vehement
protest. Carmen might have saved the money toward
a piano&ndash;&ndash;but, no; that would have been thinking of herself,
and was inadmissible. Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection.
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; commented that fond shepherd of this lone
lamb, &ldquo;she would have poured the money out into somebody&rsquo;s
open hand anyway, and it might as well be Jude&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she choked back the tears as she added: &ldquo;The girl
comes home every night with an empty purse, no matter how
full it may have been in the morning. What does she do with
the money? Follow her some day and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s slight success in the field of letters still further
aroused Haynerd&rsquo;s interest. The peacefully somnolent Social
Era, he thought, might awaken to new things under the stimulus
of such fresh writing as hers. Perhaps life did hold something
of real value after all. Would she furnish him with a
column or two on the peculiar social aspect of the metropolis?</p>
<p>She would, and did. And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent
society people sat up and blinked. The article was in no
way malicious. It was not even condemnatory. It but threw
a clear light from a somewhat unusual angle upon certain
phases of New York&rsquo;s social life, and uncovered a few of the
more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.</p>
<p>Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J.
Wilton Ames. He first lay back in his chair and laughed
uproariously. And then, when his agents discovered for him
the identity of the author, he glowered. The Beaubien was
still standing between him and this budding genius. And
though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade
fair to earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both
in luxury. So he bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he
would make them come to him. As Trustee, he would learn
what courses the girl was pursuing in the University&ndash;&ndash;for he
had long known that she was in attendance there. Then he
would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.
And he would trace her sources of income and apply pressure
at the most vital point. He had never in his life been successfully
balked. Much less by a woman.</p>
<p>Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and
to request that she attend with him the formal opening of the
new Ames mansion, the great Fifth Avenue palace, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_41' name='book4_page_41'></a>41</span>
wanted her vivid, first-hand impressions for his account of the
brilliant affair in the Social Era. As reporters, he explained,
they would of necessity remain in seclusion, and the girl might
disguise to such an extent as to prevent recognition, if she
chose. It was business for him, and an opportunity for rich
experience for her. And the fearless girl went, because it would
help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.</p>
<p>Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued
to the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of New York, announcing the formal opening of the
newly finished, magnificent Ames dwelling. These invitations
were wrought in enamel on cards of pure gold. Each had cost
thirty dollars. The mansion itself, twelve millions. A month
prior to the opening, the newspapers had printed carefully-worded
announcements of the return of Mrs. J. Wilton Ames
and her daughter, after a protracted stay at various foreign
baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the former&rsquo;s impaired
health. But Mrs. Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of
unusual brilliancy. The papers did not, however, state that
J. Wilton had himself recalled her, after quietly destroying
his bill of divorce, because he recognized the necessity of maintaining
the social side of his complicated existence on a par
with his vast business affairs.</p>
<p>As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble
structure, cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming
sense of what it stood for suddenly came upon the
girl, and she saw revealed in a flash that side of its owner&rsquo;s life
which for so many months she had been pondering. The
great shadows that seemed to issue from the massive exterior
of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she turned
and clasped Haynerd&rsquo;s arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perk up, little one,&rdquo; said Haynerd, taking her hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go round to the rear entrance, and I will present my business
card there. Ames&rsquo;s secretary telephoned me instructions, and
I said I was going to bring a lady reporter with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall,
exquisitely wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk
which led to the rear. Up the winding steps to the front entrance,
where swung the marvelous bronze doors which had
stirred the imaginations of two continents, streamed the favored
of the fashionable world. Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized. The buffoon, Larry Beers, was
there, swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson,
the multimillionaire packer. Kane and his wife, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_42' name='book4_page_42'></a>42</span>
Weston followed. Outside the gates there was incessant chugging
of automobiles, mingled with the shouted orders of the
three policemen detailed to direct the traffic. A pinched, ragged
urchin and his tattered little sister crept up and peered wildly
through the iron pickets of the fence; but a sharp rap from a
policeman&rsquo;s club sent them scattering. Carmen stood for a
moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the
marble steps and enter through those wonderful doors. There
were congressmen and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers
and preachers. Each one owed his tithe of allegiance to
Ames. Some were chained to him hard and fast, nor would
break their bonds this side of the grave. Some he owned outright.
There were those who grew white under his most
casual glance. There were others who knew that his calloused
hand was closing about them, and that when it opened again
they would fall to the ground, dry as dust. Others, like moths,
not yet singed, were hovering ever closer to the bright, cruel
flame. Reverend Darius Borwell, bowing and smiling, alighted
from his parochial car and tripped blithely up the glistening
marble steps. Each and all, wrapping the skeleton of grief,
greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and shimmering
silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a tremendous
magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.</p>
<p>Carmen shuddered and turned away. Did the pale wraith
of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?
Did the moans of poor, grief-stricken Mrs. Gannette,
sitting in her poverty and sorrow, die into silence against
those bronze doors? Was he, the being who dwelt in that
marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the carnal,
Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God? And could he
stand forever?</p>
<p>Two detectives met them at the rear door. How many
others there were scattered through the house itself, Haynerd
could only guess. But he passed inspection and was admitted
with the girl. A butler took immediate charge of them,
and led them quickly through a short passage and to an elevator,
by which they mounted to another floor, where, opening
a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end. Here
he bade them remove their wraps and await his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve crossed the Rubicon! Now don&rsquo;t miss a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed
young woman, Mrs. Ames&rsquo;s social secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very careful in your report,&rdquo; the latter began
at once in a business-like manner. &ldquo;And you will submit the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_43' name='book4_page_43'></a>43</span>
same to me for approval before it is published in your magazine.
Mr. Ames deems that imperative, since your recent publication
of an essay on modern society in this city. I have a
list here of the guests, their business and social standing, and
other data. You will run that in full. You will say that this
is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered under one roof
in New York. The wealth represented here to-night will total
not less than three billion dollars. The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions. Now, let me see,&rdquo;
again consulting her notes.</p>
<p>Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chef,&rdquo; the secretary resumed, &ldquo;was brought over from
Paris by Mrs. Ames on her recent return. His name, Pierre
Lotard, descendant of the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon
First. He considers that his menu to-night surpasses anything
he ever before achieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; interrupted Haynerd, &ldquo;the probable cost of the
supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item. It will
be in the neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate. House
and table decorations, about eight thousand dollars. Here is
a copy of the menu. Run it in full. The menu cards were
hand-illuminated by Parisian artists, and each bears a sketch
illustrative or suggestive of the guest to whom it is given.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cost?&rdquo; queried Haynerd off-handedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three thousand, if I correctly recall it,&rdquo; was the nonchalant
reply. &ldquo;As to the viands, you will mention that they have been
gathered from every part of the world. Now come with me,
and I will give you a hasty sketch of the house, while the guests
are assembling in the grand salon. Then you will remain in
the balcony, where you will make what notes you wish on
the dress displayed. Refreshments will be served to you later
in this waiting room. I need not remind you that you are
not expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.
Keep to the balcony, and quite out of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening a door opposite the one through which she had
entered, the young woman led her charges directly out upon
the great marble balcony overlooking the grand salon below.
A rush of brilliant light engulfed them, and a potpourri of
chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music from a distant
organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in the still
more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered
down upon the gorgeous pageant. The ceiling rose far above
them, delicately tinted like a soft Italian sky. The lofty walls
dropped, like gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_44' name='book4_page_44'></a>44</span>
wainscoting beneath, which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval
castle on the Rhine. The great windows were hidden
behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over which fell hangings of
brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall and the brocade-covered
chairs and divans ranged close about the sides of the
splendid room. On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly. From
the end of the salon he could mark the short flight of steps
which led to the mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried,
and broken by rich oak doors opening into lavatories and
lounging rooms, itself widening at the far end into the grand
billiard and smoking parlors, done off in Circassian walnut,
with tables and furniture to harmonize. From the mezzanine
he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world&rsquo;s greatest quarries,
and delicately chased and carved into classic designs.
Two tapestries, centuries old, hung from the walls on either
side. Far above, the oak ceiling, for which the <i>Schwarzwald</i>
had been ranged, was overlaid with pure gold leaf. The whole
was suffused with the glow of myriad hidden and inverted
lights, reflected in a thousand angles from burnished gold and
marble and rarest gems.</p>
<p>Haynerd turned to the waiting secretary. He groped in the
chambers of his imagery for some superlative adjective to express
his emotion before this colossal display of wealth. But
his ample vocabulary had faded quite. He could only shake
his head and give vent to the inept remark, &ldquo;Swell&ndash;&ndash;by George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.
Passing noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she
indicated a door below, leading off to the right from the grand
salon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That room beyond,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the petit salon. The
decorative effects are by French artists. Beyond that is the
morning room. It is in panels from French chateaux, covered
with Gobelin tapestry. Now from here you can see a bit of
the music room. The grand organ cost, installed, about two
hundred thousand dollars. It is electrically controlled, with
its pipes running all around the room, so as to give the effect
of music coming from every corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd again softly whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and
one for sculpture. Mr. Ames has without doubt the finest art
collection in America. It includes several Titians, Veroneses,
da Vincis, Turners, three Rubens, and two Raphaels. By the
way, it may interest you to know that his negotiations for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_45' name='book4_page_45'></a>45</span>
Murillo Madonna were completed to-day, and the picture will
be sent to him immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might I ask what he paid for it?&rdquo; Haynerd inquired casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say that he paid something over three hundred
thousand dollars for it,&rdquo; she replied, in a quite matter of fact
tone. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;you will go back to your first
position, near the door of the waiting room, and remain there
until I return. I may have an opportunity later to show you
the library. It is very unique. Great carved stone fireplace,
taken from a Scotch castle. Hundreds of rare volumes and
first editions. Now, if any one approaches, you can step behind
the screen and remain out of view. You have chairs and
a table there for your writing. Do not in any event leave this
balcony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into
the little waiting room from which they had emerged.</p>
<p>For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately
at each other and about them at their magnificent
environment. Both had seen much of the gilded life, and the
girl had dwelt some months in its alien atmosphere. But
neither had ever witnessed such a stupendous display of material
wealth as was here unfolded before their astonished gaze.
At the head of the grand stairway stood the Ames trio, to
receive their resplendent guests. The women were magnificently
gowned. But Ames&rsquo;s massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes. Even Haynerd
could not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the
splendid figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;a victim, like the rest, of the
great delusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had
been studying the man. &ldquo;He is an expression,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of
the American ideal&ndash;&ndash;the ideal of practical material life. It is
toward his plane of life that this country&rsquo;s youth are struggling,
at, oh, what a cost! Think, think, what his immense, misused
revenue could do, if unselfishly used! Why, the cost of
this single night&rsquo;s show would put two hundred men like
Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life&rsquo;s work! And what, what will Mr.
Ames get out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose,&rdquo;
returned Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, will he get real happiness? Peace? Joy? And does
he need further opportunities to accumulate money? Does he
not rather need some one to show him the meaning of life,
how to really live?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_46' name='book4_page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He does, indeed! And it may be your mission, Carmen, to
do just that. But if you don&rsquo;t, then I sincerely hope the man
may die before he discovers that all that he has achieved, his
wealth, his prestige, his power, have not been worth striving
for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t the slightest idea of the meaning of life,&rdquo; she
murmured, looking down upon the glittering throng. &ldquo;Nor
have any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;They put me in mind of Carlyle&rsquo;s famous
remark, as he stood looking out across the London Strand:
&lsquo;There are in this city some four million people, mostly fools.&rsquo;
How mean, narrow and hard their lives are! These are the
high priests of vested privilege, of mediaevalism, of old institutions
whose perpetual maintenance, even in a generation
that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight upon
us. Ah, there&rsquo;s little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out! He&rsquo;s
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence
to coaching trips along the New England shore. He reminds
me of the Fleet street poet who wrote a century ago of
the similar occupation of a young dandy of that day&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>What can little T. O. do?<br />

Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do
pictures, look at them in the best light,&rdquo; murmured Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, hang them in the best light!&rdquo; returned Haynerd.
&ldquo;But make sure they&rsquo;re well hung! There goes the pseudo-princess,
member of the royal house of England. She carries
the royal taint, too. I tell you, under the splash and glitter you
can see the feet of clay, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Carmen, &ldquo;resting upon the high heel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust. &ldquo;The
women of fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn&rsquo;t do a
good job when He designed the feminine sex&ndash;&ndash;that He should
have put a hump where the heel is, so&rsquo;s to slant the foot and
make comfortable walking impossible, as well as to insure a
plentiful crop of foot-troubles and deformities. The Chinese
women used to manifest a similarly insane thought. Good
heavens! High heel, low brain! The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the
throng below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted
woman, resplendent with diamonds. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_47' name='book4_page_47'></a>47</span>
eminent French guest, Madam Carot. She severed herself
from her tiresome consort last year by means of a bichloride
tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then, leaving a sigh
of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains, hastened to
our friendly shores, to grace the <i>beau monde</i> with her gowns
and jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact,&rdquo; he stubbornly insisted. &ldquo;The Social Era got the
whole spicy story. And there beside her is our indispensable
Mrs. T. Oliver Pennymon. See, she&rsquo;s drifted up to young
Watson! Coquetting for a husband still, the old buzzard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Haynerd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s fact, anyway,&rdquo; persisted the society monitor.
&ldquo;And there beyond her is fat little Mrs. Stuffenheimer, with
her two unlovely, red-faced daughters. Ah, the despairing
mamma is still vainly angling for mates for her two chubby
Venuses! If they&rsquo;re not married off properly and into good
social positions soon, it&rsquo;s mamma for the scrap heap! By
George! it&rsquo;s positively tragic to see these anxious mothers at
Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters,
dragging them from one function to another in the wild hope
that they may ultimately land a man. Worry and pain dig deep
furrows into poor mamma&rsquo;s face if she sees her daughters
fading into the has-been class. It requires heroism, I say, to
travel in society! But I guess you know, eh? Well,&rdquo; taking
up his notebook, &ldquo;we must get busy now. By the way, how&rsquo;s
your shorthand progressing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, splendidly,&rdquo; replied the girl, her eyes still upon the
massive figure of Ames. Then, recovering from her abstraction,
&ldquo;I can write as fast in it now as in longhand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Haynerd. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the
splendid balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence
below. Through the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless
paean of thanksgiving for her timely deliverance from the
trammels which she so well knew enshackled these glittering
birds of paradise. With it mingled a great, consuming desire,
a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of high society the
leaven of her own pure thought. In particular did her boundless
love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.
Why was he doing this? What ulterior motive had
he? Was it only a vainglorious exhibition of his own human
prowess? Was it an announcement, magnificent beyond
compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the supreme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_48' name='book4_page_48'></a>48</span>
heights of gratified world ambition? That the world at last
lay at his feet? And that over it brooded the giant&rsquo;s lament
that there remained nothing more to conquer? But, if so, the
girl at least knew that the man&rsquo;s herculean efforts to subdue
the material world were as nothing. The real conquest lay still
before him, the conquest of self. And when that were faced
and achieved, well she knew that no such garish display as
this would announce the victory to a breathless world.</p>
<p>The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and
briefly announced the production of an opera in the auditorium,
to which she had come to conduct them. Passing through
the little waiting room and to the elevator, they quickly
mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the theater above. The
parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand spectators, was
rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng. The Ames trio
and some of the more distinguished guests were already occupying
the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides. An
orchestra of fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the
stage. Caroni, the famous grand opera leader, stood ready to
conduct. The opera itself was the much discussed music
drama, Salome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion,
who was lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural
decorations of the little theater, &ldquo;we will see something rare,
for this opera has been called the most artistic piece of indecency
known to the stage. Good heavens! Ames has got Marie
Deschamps for the title r&ocirc;le. She&rsquo;ll cost him not less than five
thousand dollars for this one night. And&ndash;&ndash;see here,&rdquo; drawing
Carmen&rsquo;s attention to the bill, &ldquo;Marcou and Corvalle besides!
The man must be made of money! These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational
theme was introduced. But to none came thoughts like those
which clamored for admittance at the portals of Carmen&rsquo;s
mentality. In the bold challenge of the insanely sensual portrayal
of a carnal mind the girl saw the age-old defiance of the
spirit by the flesh. In the rolls of the wondrous music, in its
shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes, she heard voiced
again the soul-lament of a weary world searching vainly in
the mazes of human thought for truth. As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and
fell gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic
struggles of a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon
lays bare the malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues
of a human frame. The immodesty of dress, the sensual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_49' name='book4_page_49'></a>49</span>
suggestiveness of the dance, the brutal flouting of every element
of refinement and delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and
movement the bloody orgy and dance of death which goes on
incessantly upon the stage of human life, and ends in the mad
whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the lifeless
trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the limit of tolerance, eh?&rdquo; commented Haynerd,
when the final curtain dropped. &ldquo;Yes, even to a vitiated taste.
The passionate thirst for the sensational has led to this sickening
display of salacity&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; came in tones of admiration from the
social secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back
to the balcony before the guests emerged from the theater.
&ldquo;You will run the program in full, and comment at some length
on the expense attached,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You have just witnessed
the private production of a full opera, unabridged, and
with the regular operatic cast. Supper will follow in a half
hour. Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you
were before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a
chair at the little table behind the screen, and strove to orient
her thought. Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous
notes. Presently footsteps were heard, and the sound
of voices. Haynerd glanced through the hinge of the screen.
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;here comes Ames and&ndash;&ndash;who&rsquo;s with him?
Ah, Representative Wales. Showing him about, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes,
although she saw but one, the towering magician who had
reared this fairy palace. She saw Ames lead his companion
to the door of the little waiting room at their right, and heard
the congressman protest against entering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can talk undisturbed in here,&rdquo; urged Ames, his
hand on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better remain out here on the balcony,&rdquo; replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.</p>
<p>Ames laughed and shrugged his enormous shoulders. He
understood the man&rsquo;s repugnance fully. But he humored him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Wales,&rdquo; he said easily, going to the railing and
peering over at the brilliant assemblage below, &ldquo;if I could get
the heathen Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length,
I&rsquo;d make a hundred millions. And then, perhaps, I wouldn&rsquo;t
need to struggle with your Ways and Means Committee as I
do. By the way, the cotton schedule will be reported out unchanged,
I presume.&rdquo; He turned and looked quizzically at his
companion as he said this.</p>
<p>Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he
had been awaiting. &ldquo;I think not, Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_50' name='book4_page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>The giant&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;Parsons will vote for it,&rdquo; he
said suggestively. &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The congressman hesitated. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;the party, Mr. Ames, is
committed to the high tariff principle. We can not let in a
flood of foreign cotton&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners
to continue, eh?&rdquo; interposed Ames cynically. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem
to realize that in the end both will get more money than they
are getting now, and that it will come from the consumer, who
will pay vastly higher for his finished products, in addition to
the tariff. Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a party principle, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; returned the congressman
tenaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Wales,&rdquo; said Ames, turning savagely upon his
companion. &ldquo;The cotton farmers are organizing. They have
got to be stopped. Their co&ouml;perative associations must be
smashed. The tariff schedule which you have before your Committee
will do it. And you are going to pass it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; replied the congressman, &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I am opposed to
the constant manipulation of cotton by you rich men. I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; interrupted Ames, &ldquo;never mind explaining your
conscientious scruples. What I want to know is, do you intend
to cast your vote for the unaltered schedule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;no, Mr. Ames, I can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; murmured Ames. Then, with easy nonchalance,
turning to an apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the
railing, &ldquo;I heard just before coming from my office this evening
that the doors of the Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.
Too bad! A lot of my personal friends are heavily
involved. Bank&rsquo;s been shaky for some time. Ames and Company
will take over their tangible assets; I believe you were
interested, were you not?&rdquo; He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>Wales turned ashen. His hands shook as he grasped the
railing before him and tried to steady himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hits you pretty hard, eh?&rdquo; coolly queried Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;very hard,&rdquo; murmured the dazed man. &ldquo;Are
you&ndash;&ndash;positive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. But step into the waiting room and &rsquo;phone the newspapers.
They will corroborate my statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.
His election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself
included, excepting Ames. Wales knew not that his detailed
personal history had been for many months carefully
filed in the vaults of the Ames tower. Nor did he ever suspect
that his candidacy and election had been matters of most careful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_51' name='book4_page_51'></a>51</span>
thought on the part of the great financier and his political
associates. But when he, a stranger to congressional halls,
was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds. Then Ames had smiled
his own gratification, and arranged that the new member
should attend the formal opening of the great Ames palace
later in the year. Meantime, the financier and the new congressman
had met on several occasions, and the latter had felt
no little pride in the attention which the great man had shown
him.</p>
<p>And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the
guileless Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his
thraldom had penetrated and darkened his thought. Then,
like a crash from a clear sky, had come the announcement of
the Mercantile Trust failure. And as he stood there now,
clutching the marble railing, his thought busy with the woman
and the two fair children who would be rendered penniless by
this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed to
bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman
cunning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much are you likely to lose by this failure?&rdquo; the giant
asked.</p>
<p>Wales collected his scattered senses. &ldquo;Not less than fifty
thousand dollars,&rdquo; he replied in a husky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; commented Ames. &ldquo;Too bad! too bad! Well, let&rsquo;s
go below. Ha! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; stooping and apparently taking
up an object that had been lying on the floor back of the congressman.
&ldquo;Well! well! your bank book, Wales. Must have
slipped from your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I
have no&ndash;&ndash;this is not mine,&rdquo; he murmured, gazing alternately
at the pass book and at Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s on it, at least,&rdquo; commented Ames laconically.
&ldquo;And the book&rsquo;s been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.
Guess you&rsquo;ve forgotten opening an account there, let me see,
yes, a week ago.&rdquo; He took the book and opened it. &ldquo;Ah, yes,
I recall the incident now. There&rsquo;s your deposit, made last
Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wales choked. What did it mean? The book, made out in
his name on Ames and Company, showed a deposit to his credit
of fifty thousand dollars!</p>
<p>Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman&rsquo;s,
and started with him down the balcony. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said,
as they moved away, &ldquo;the Mercantile failure will not hit you
as hard as you thought. Now, about that cotton schedule, when
you cast your vote for it, be sure that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The voice died away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_52' name='book4_page_52'></a>52</span>
as the men disappeared in the distance, leaving Carmen and
Haynerd staring blankly at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd at length. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must save them both,&rdquo; said Carmen quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!&rdquo; exclaimed
Haynerd excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lose your soul,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;But I will see Mr.
Ames, and tell him that we overheard his conversation. He
will save us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from
one who knew the world. &ldquo;Listen, my dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
will keep quiet, you and I. To mention this would be only to
court disaster at the hands of one who would strangle us at
the slightest intimation of our knowledge. Can you not see
the consequences to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see but the right,&rdquo; returned Carmen determinedly.
&ldquo;And the right shall prevail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear girl,&rdquo; cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed
both for himself and her, &ldquo;he would ruin us! This is no
affair of ours. We had no intention of hearing; and so let it
be as if we had not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let the lie of evil prevail? No, Mr. Haynerd, I could
not, if I would. Mr. Ames is being used by evil; and it is
making him a channel to ruin Mr. Wales. Shall I stand idly
by and permit it? No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on her face. Haynerd
sprang to his feet and laid a detaining hand upon her arm.
As he did so, the screen was quickly drawn aside, and Kathleen
Ames and two of her young companions bent their curious gaze
in upon them. Absorbed in their earnest conversation, Carmen
and Haynerd had not heard the approach of the young ladies,
who were on a tour of inspection of the house before supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporters for the Social Era, Miss Ames,&rdquo; explained Haynerd,
hastily answering the unspoken question, while he made
a courteous bow.</p>
<p>But Kathleen had not heard him. &ldquo;What&ndash;&ndash;you!&rdquo; she cried,
instantly recognizing Carmen, and drawing back. &ldquo;How dared
you! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; asked one of the young ladies, as her
eyes roved over Carmen&rsquo;s tense, motionless figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;creature!&rdquo; cried Kathleen, spurting her venom at
Carmen, while her eyes snapped angrily and her hands twitched.
&ldquo;When the front door is closed against you, you sneak in
through the back door! Leave this house, instantly, or I shall
have you thrown into the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kathleen dear!&rdquo; exclaimed one of her companions.
&ldquo;She is only a reporter!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_53' name='book4_page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She is a low, negro wench!&rdquo; cried Kathleen maliciously.
&ldquo;She comes from a brothel! She foisted herself upon society,
and was discovered and kicked out! Her father is a dirty
negro priest, and her mother a low&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd rushed to the maddened girl and clapped his
hand over her mouth. &ldquo;Hush, for God&rsquo;s sake, Miss Ames!&rdquo;
Then, to her companions, &ldquo;Take her away!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;And
we will leave at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a house detective, attracted by the loud conversation,
had come up and interposed. At his signal another one approached.
&ldquo;Bring Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he quietly commanded. &ldquo;I can
not put them out if they have his permission to remain,&rdquo; he
explained to the angry Kathleen.</p>
<p>In a few moments, during which the little group stood tense
and quiet, Ames himself appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; as his eyes lighted upon
Carmen. &ldquo;My little girl! And&ndash;&ndash;so this is your assistant?&rdquo;
turning inquiringly to Haynerd. &ldquo;By George! Her article in
last week&rsquo;s Social Era was a corker. But,&rdquo; staring from
Kathleen to the others, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that creature put out of the house!&rdquo; demanded
Kathleen, trembling with rage and pointing to Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; returned Ames easily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s on business, and
has my permission to remain. But, by George! that&rsquo;s a good
joke,&rdquo; winking at Haynerd and breaking into a loud laugh.
&ldquo;You put one over on us there, old man!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Scalding tears of anger and humiliation were
streaming down Kathleen&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;If she remains, I shall go&ndash;&ndash;I
shall leave the house&ndash;&ndash;I will not stay under the same roof
with the lewd creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, run along,&rdquo; said Ames, taking the humiliated
Kathleen by the shoulders and turning her about. &ldquo;I
will settle this without your assistance.&rdquo; Then he motioned
to the house detectives to depart, and turned to Haynerd and
Carmen. &ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; he said, leading the way to the little
waiting room, and opening the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! but you belong down stairs with the rest,&rdquo; he
ejaculated as he faced Carmen, standing before him pale but
unafraid. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one down there who is in your class!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, placing his hands upon her shoulders and looking
down into her beautiful face. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued with sudden
determination, &ldquo;I am going to take you down, and you
will sit at the table with me, as my special guest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden fear gripped Haynerd, and he started to interpose.
But Carmen spoke first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Take me down.
I have a question to ask Mr. Wales when we are at the table.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_54' name='book4_page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>An expression of surprise and inquiry came into Ames&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Mr. Wales?&rdquo; he said wonderingly. &ldquo;You mean Congressman&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he stopped abruptly, and looked searchingly at Carmen
and her companion. Haynerd paled. Carmen stood unflinching.
Ames&rsquo;s expression of surprise gave place to one
dark and menacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were behind that screen when Congressman Wales
and I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Carmen calmly. &ldquo;I overheard all you said.
I saw you bribe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames stood like a huge, black cloud, glowering down upon
the slender girl. She looked up at him and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to tell him that the fifty thousand dollars
are just a loan, and that he may vote as he chooses, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will not ruin his life, and the lives of
his wife and babies, will you? You would never be happy,
you know, if you did.&rdquo; Her voice was as quiet as the morning
breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; the giant sneered. &ldquo;You come into my house to play
spy, eh? And if I had not caught you when I did you would
have written another interesting article for the Social Era,
wouldn&rsquo;t you? By God! I&rsquo;ll break you, Haynerd, and your
infernal sheet into a million pieces if you dare print any such
rot as this! And as for you, young lady&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do nothing to me, Mr. Ames; and you don&rsquo;t really
want to,&rdquo; said Carmen quickly. &ldquo;My reputation, you know&ndash;&ndash;that
is, the one which you people have given me&ndash;&ndash;is just as
black as it could be, isn&rsquo;t it? So that is safe.&rdquo; She laughed
lightly.</p>
<p>Then she became very serious again. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really
make any difference to you, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whether the
cotton schedule is passed or not. You still have your millions&ndash;&ndash;oh,
so much more than you will ever know what to do with!
But Mr. Wales, he has his wife and his babies and his good
reputation&ndash;&ndash;would you rob him of those priceless treasures,
just to make a few dollars more for yourself?&ndash;&ndash;dollars that
you can&rsquo;t spend, and that you won&rsquo;t let others have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the girl&rsquo;s quiet talk Ames was regaining his self-control.
When she concluded he turned to Haynerd. &ldquo;Miss
Carmen can step out into the balcony. You and I will arrange
this matter together,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Carmen moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ames significantly, and in a low voice, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
your price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the girl turned back and threw herself between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_55' name='book4_page_55'></a>55</span>
the two men. &ldquo;He is not for sale!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes flashing
as she confronted Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by God!&rdquo; shouted Ames, who had lost himself completely,
&ldquo;I will crush him like a dirty spider! And you, I&rsquo;ll drag
you through the gutters and make your name a synonym of all
that is vile in womanhood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen stepped quietly to the elevator and pressed the
signal button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not leave this house!&rdquo; cried the enraged Ames,
starting toward her. &ldquo;Or you&rsquo;ll go under arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew herself up with splendid dignity, and faced
him fearlessly. &ldquo;We <i>shall</i> leave your house, and now, Mr.
Ames!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You and that for which you stand can not
touch us! The carnal mind is back of you! Omnipotent God
is with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved away from him, then turned and stood for a
moment, flashing, sparkling, radiant with a power which he
could not comprehend. &ldquo;You know not what you do. You are
blinded and deceived by human lust and greed. But the god
you so ignorantly worship now will some day totter and fall
upon you. Then you will awake, and you will see your present
life as a horrid dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator appeared. Carmen and the dazed Haynerd
stepped quickly into it and descended without opposition to
the lower floor. A few moments later they were again in the
street and hurrying to the nearest car line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girlie,&rdquo; said Haynerd, mopping the perspiration from his
brow, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in for it now&ndash;&ndash;and I shall be crushed! But you&ndash;&ndash;I
think your God will save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen took his hand. &ldquo;His arm is not shortened,&rdquo; she
murmured, &ldquo;that He can not save us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5</p>
<p>ON the Monday morning following the Ames reception the
society columns of the daily papers still teemed with extravagant
depictions of the magnificent affair. On that
same morning, while Haynerd sat gloomily in the office of the
Social Era, meditating on his giant adversary&rsquo;s probable first
move, Carmen, leaving her studies and classes, sought out an
unpretentious home in one of the suburbs of the city, and for
an hour or more talked earnestly with the timid, frightened
little wife of Congressman Wales. Then, her work done, she
dismissed the whole affair from her mind, and hastened joyously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_56' name='book4_page_56'></a>56</span>
back to the University. She would have gone to see
Ames himself. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she reflected, as she dwelt on his conduct
and words of the previous Saturday evening, &ldquo;he is not
ready for it yet. And when he is, I will go to him. And Kathleen&ndash;&ndash;well,
I will help her by seeing only the real child of God,
which was hidden that night by the veil of hatred and jealousy.
And that veil, after all, is but a shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the little group of searchers after God assembled
again in the peaceful precincts of the Beaubien cottage.
It was their third meeting, and they had come together
reverently to pursue the most momentous inquiry that has
ever stimulated human thought.</p>
<p>Haynerd and Carmen had said little relative to the Ames
reception; but the former, still brooding over the certain consequences
of his brush with Ames, was dejected and distraught.
Carmen, leaning upon her sustaining thought, and conceding
no mite of power or intelligence to evil, glowed like a radiant
star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you listening to?&rdquo; she asked of Haynerd, drawing
him to one side. &ldquo;Are you giving ear to the voices of evil, or
good? Which are you making real to yourself? For those
thoughts which are real to you will become outwardly manifested,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! He&rsquo;s got us&ndash;&ndash;tight!&rdquo; muttered Haynerd, with a
gesture signifying defeat. &ldquo;And the insults of that arrogant
daughter of his&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not insult me,&rdquo; said Carmen quickly. &ldquo;She could
not, for she doesn&rsquo;t know me. She merely denounced her concept
of me, and not my real self. She vilified what she thought
was Carmen Ariza; but it was only her own thought of me that
she insulted. Can&rsquo;t you see? And such a concept of me as
she holds deserves denouncing, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to do?&rdquo; he pursued testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to know,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that we two with
God constitute an overwhelming majority.&rdquo; She said nothing
about her visit to the Wales home that morning, but pressed
his hand, and then went to take her place at the table, where
Father Waite was already rapping for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; began that earnest young man, looking lovingly
about at the little group, &ldquo;as we are gathered here we
symbolize that analytical, critical endeavor of the unbiased
human mind to discover the essence of religion. Religion is
that which binds us to absolute truth, and so is truth itself. If
there is a God, we believe from our former investigations that
He must be universal mind. This belief carries with it as necessary
corollaries the beliefs that He must be perfect, eternal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_57' name='book4_page_57'></a>57</span>
and self-existent. The question, Who made God? must then
receive its sufficient answer in the staggering statement that
He has always existed, unchanged and unchangeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sigh from Haynerd announced that quizzical soul&rsquo;s struggle
to grasp a statement at once so radical and stupendous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; continued Father Waite, addressing himself to his
doubting friend, &ldquo;the acceptance as fact of what we have deduced
in our previous meetings must render the God of orthodox
theology quite obsolete. But, as a compensation, it gives to
us the most enlarged and beautiful concept of Him that we have
ever had. It ennobles, broadens, purifies, and elevates our idea
of Him. It destroys forever our belittling view of Him as but
a magnified human character, full of wrath and caprice and
angry threats, and delighting in human ceremonial and religious
thaumaturgy. And, most practical of all for us, it
renders the age-long problem of evil amenable to solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then came a ring at the front door; and a moment
later the Beaubien ushered Doctor Morton into the room. All
rose and hastened to welcome him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I am sure,&rdquo; began the visitor, looking at Carmen, &ldquo;that
I am not intruding, for I really come on invitation, you know.
Miss Carmen, first; and then, our good friend Hitt, who told
me this afternoon that you would probably meet this evening.
I&ndash;&ndash;I pondered the matter some little time&ndash;&ndash;ah, but&ndash;&ndash;well, to
make it short, I couldn&rsquo;t keep away from a gathering so absolutely
unique as this&ndash;&ndash;I really couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen seized both his hands. &ldquo;My!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her
eyes dancing, &ldquo;I am glad you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, too,&rdquo; interposed Haynerd dryly, &ldquo;for now we have
two theological Philistines. I was feeling a bit lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;I am simply an advocate
of religious freedom, not a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And religious freedom, as our wise Bill Nye once said, is
but the art of giving intolerance a little more room, eh?&rdquo; returned
Haynerd with a laugh.</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You are a Philistine,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I am a human interrogation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen took the doctor by the arm and led him to a place
beside her at the table. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you didn&rsquo;t bring poor Yorick?&rdquo;
she whispered, with a glint of mischief in her bright eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed the genial visitor, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a dead one, you told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;awfully dead! He is an outward
manifestation of dead human beliefs, isn&rsquo;t he? But now listen,
Father Waite is going to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief explanation to the doctor of the purpose of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_58' name='book4_page_58'></a>58</span>
the meeting, and a short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of their previous deductions,
Father Waite continued the exposition of his subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The physical universe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to human beings a
reality. And yet, according to Spencer&rsquo;s definition of reality,
we must admit that the universe as we see it is quite unreal.
For the real is that which endures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean to say that the universe will not endure?&rdquo;
queried Haynerd abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;The phenomena of the
universe, even as we see it, are in a state of ceaseless change.
Birth, growth, maturity, decay, and death seems to be the law
for all things material. There is perpetual genesis, and perpetual
exodus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; again urged Haynerd, &ldquo;matter itself remains, is indestructible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Father Waite. &ldquo;Our friend, Doctor Morton,
will corroborate my statement, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor nodded. &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he said in reply.
&ldquo;And as revolutionary as true. The discovery, in the past few
years, of the tremendously important fact that matter disintegrates
and actually disappears, has revolutionized all physical
science and rendered the world&rsquo;s text books obsolete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And matter actually disappears?&rdquo; echoed Miss Wall incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; interposed Hitt. &ldquo;The radium atom, we find,
lasts some seventeen hundred years, or a trifle longer. What
becomes of it when it is destroyed? We can only say that it
disappears from human consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you reason that the whole material universe will
ultimately disappear from the human consciousness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Hitt, &ldquo;I feel certain of it. Let us consider
of what the universe consists. For many months I have been
pondering this topic incessantly. I find that I can agree, in a
measure, with those scientists who regard the physical universe
as composed of only a few elementary constituents,
namely, matter, energy, space, and time&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each one of these elements is mental,&rdquo; interrupted Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;And the physical universe, even
from the human standpoint, is, therefore, wholly mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but we see it!&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd. &ldquo;And we feel
and hear it! And I&rsquo;m sure we smell it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interposed Father Waite; &ldquo;we see only our mental
concept of a universe, for seeing is wholly a mental process.
Our comprehension of anything is entirely mental.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_59' name='book4_page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; resumed Hitt, &ldquo;to get back to the supposed
reality of the physical universe, let us examine its constituents.
First, let us consider its unity established by the harmonious
interplay of the forces permeating it. This great fact is what
led Herbert Spencer to conclude that the universe could have
but one creator, one ruler, and that polytheism was untenable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are quite agreed regarding that,&rdquo; said Father Waite.
&ldquo;If the Creator is mind, He is of very necessity infinite and
omnipotent; hence there can be but one Creator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Hitt. &ldquo;Now as to time. Is it material
or tangible? Would it exist, but as a convenience for the
human mind? Is it not really a creation of that mind? And,
lastly, is it not merely a mental concept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our consciousness of time,&rdquo; replied Carmen, &ldquo;is only our
awareness of a continuous series of mental states.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That classifies it exactly,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;and renders it wholly
mental. And now as to space,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;We are accustomed
to say, loosely, that space is that in which we see
things about us. But in what does the process of seeing consist?
I say, I see a chair. What I really mean is that I am
conscious of a chair. The process of seeing, we are told, is
this: light, coming from the chair, enters the eye and casts an
image of the chair upon the retina, much as a picture is thrown
upon the ground glass of a camera. Then, in some way, the
little rods and cones&ndash;&ndash;the branching tips of the optic nerve
which project from the retina&ndash;&ndash;are set in motion by the light-waves.
This vibration is in some mysterious manner carried
along the optic nerve to a center in the brain, and&ndash;&ndash;well, then
the mind becomes cognizant of the chair out there, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat silent for some moments. Then Miss Wall spoke.
&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; she queried, &ldquo;that, after thousands of
years of thought and investigation, mankind now know nothing
more than that about the process of seeing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; returned Hitt. &ldquo;I confess it in all humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; put in Haynerd, &ldquo;is that the
most remarkable thing about you learned men is your ignorance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled. &ldquo;I find it is only the fool who is cocksure,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hitt, resuming the conversation, &ldquo;let us go a
step further and inquire, first, What is light? since the process
of seeing is absolutely dependent upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; offered the doctor, &ldquo;is vibrations, or wave-motion,
so physicists tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; resumed Hitt. &ldquo;Light, we say, consists of vibrations.
Not vibrations of anything tangible or definitely material,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_60' name='book4_page_60'></a>60</span>
but&ndash;&ndash;well, just vibrations in the abstract. It is vibratory
or wave motion. Now let us concede that these vibrations in
some way get to the brain center; and then let us ask, Is the
mind there, in the brain, awaiting the arrival of these vibrations
to inform it that there is a chair outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd indulged in a cynical laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too serious for laughter, my friend,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;For
to such crude beliefs as this we may attribute all the miseries
of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; queried Miss Wall in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply because these beliefs constitute the general belief
in a universe of matter without and about us. As a plain statement
of fact, <i>there is no such thing</i>. But, I ask again, Is the
mind within the brain, waiting for vibrations that will give it
information concerning the external world? Or does the mind,
from some focal point without the brain, look first at these
vibrations, and then translate them into terms of things without?
Do these vibrations in some way suggest form and color
and substance to the waiting mind? Does the mind first look
at vibrating nerve-points, and then form its own opinions regarding
material objects? Does anything material enter the
eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted the doctor; &ldquo;unless we believe that vibrations
<i>per se</i> are material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I ask, Is the mind reduced to such slavery that it
must depend upon vibrations for its knowledge of an outside
world?&rdquo; continued Hitt. &ldquo;And vibrations of minute pieces of
flesh, at that! Flesh that will some day decay and leave the
mind helpless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t the mind
look directly at the chair, instead of getting its knowledge of
the chair through vibrations of bits of meat? Or isn&rsquo;t there
any chair out there to look at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Hitt. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve put your mental
finger upon it. And now we are ready to nail to the cross of
ignominy one of the crudest, most insensate beliefs of the
human race. <i>The human mind gets nothing whatsoever from
vibrations, from the human, fleshly eye, nor from any one of
the five so-called physical senses!</i> The physical sense-testimony
which mankind believe they receive from the eyes, the ears, and
the other sense organs, can, even at best, consist only of a lot of
disconnected, unintelligible vibrations; and anything that the
mind may infer from such vibrations is inferred <i>without any
outside authority whatsoever!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Wall and Haynerd in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, further,&rdquo; continued Hitt, &ldquo;we are forced to admit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_61' name='book4_page_61'></a>61</span>
that all that the mind knows is the contents of itself, of its
own consciousness, and nothing more. Then, instead of seeing,
hearing, and feeling real material objects outside of ourselves,
we are in reality seeing, hearing, and feeling our own mental
concepts of things&ndash;&ndash;in other words, <i>our own thoughts of
things!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>A deep silence lay for some moments over the little group at
the conclusion of Hitt&rsquo;s words. Then Doctor Morton nodded
his acquiescence in the deduction. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;effectually
disposes of the question of space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no space, Doctor,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;Space is likewise
a mental concept. The human mind sees, hears, and feels
nothing but its own thoughts. These it posits within itself
with reference to one another, and calls the process &lsquo;seeing
material objects in space.&rsquo; The mind as little needs a space in
which to see things as in which to dream them. I repeat, we
do not see external things, or things outside of ourselves. We
see always and only the thoughts that are within our own
mentalities. Everything is within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; murmured Carmen, &ldquo;Jesus said, &lsquo;The kingdom
of heaven is within you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;Did he not call evil, and all that
originates in matter, the lie about God? And a lie is wholly
mental. I tell you, the existence of a world outside of ourselves,
an objective world composed of matter, is wholly inferred&ndash;&ndash;it
is mental visualizing&ndash;&ndash;and it is unreal, for it is not based upon
fact, upon truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; queried Haynerd, &ldquo;our supposed &lsquo;outer world&rsquo; is
but our collection of thought-concepts which we hold within
us, within our own consciousness, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the question of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready for that again,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;We have
said that in the physical universe all is in a state of incessant
change. Since the physical universe is but a mental concept
to each one of us, we must admit that, were the concept based
upon truth, it would not change. Our concept of the universe
must be without the real causative and sustaining principle of
all reality, else would it not pass away. And yet, beneath and
behind all these changes, <i>something</i> endures. What is it?
Matter? No. There is an enduring substance, invisible to human
sight, but felt and known through its own influence. Is
it law? Yes. Mind? Yes. Ideas? Yes. But none of these
things is in any sense material. The material is the fleeting,
human concept, composed of thought that is <i>not</i> based upon
reality. These other things, wholly mental, or spiritual, if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_62' name='book4_page_62'></a>62</span>
prefer, are based upon that &lsquo;something&rsquo; which does endure,
and which I will call the Causative Principle. It is the Universal
Mind. It is what you loosely call God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then did God make matter?&rdquo; persisted Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; interposed Doctor Morton at this juncture, &ldquo;that
I can throw some light upon the immaterial character of matter,
if I may so put it; for even our physical reasoning throws
it entirely into the realm of the mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Hitt. &ldquo;Let us hear from you, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor sat for some moments in a deep study. Then
he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The constitution of matter, speaking now from an admittedly
materialistic standpoint, that of the physical sciences, is
a subject of vastest interest and importance to mankind, for
human existence <i>is</i> material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ultimate constituent of matter has been called the
atom. But we have said little when we have said that. The
atom was once defined as a particle of matter so minute as to
admit of no further division. That definition has gone to the
rubbish heap, for the atom can now be torn to pieces. But&ndash;&ndash;and
here is the revolutionary fact in modern physical science&ndash;&ndash;<i>it
is no longer held necessary that matter should consist of
material particles!</i> In fact, the great potential discovery of
our day is that matter is electrical in composition, that it is
composed of what are called &lsquo;electrons,&rsquo; and that these electrons
are themselves composed of electric charges. But what
is an electric charge? Is it matter? No, not as we know matter.
Is it even material? We can not say that it is. It is without
weight, bulk, dimensions, or tangibility. Well, then, it comes
dangerously near being a mental thing, known to the human
mind solely by its manifestations, does it not? And of course
our comprehension of it is entirely mental, as is our comprehension
of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, that his words might be fully
grasped. Then he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now these atoms, whatever they are, are supposed to join
together to form molecules. What brings them together thus?
Affinity, we are told. And what is affinity? Why, it is&ndash;&ndash;well,
law, if you please. And law? A mental thing, we must admit.
Very good. Then, going a step further, molecules are held
together by cohesion to form material objects, chairs, trees,
coal, and the like. But what is cohesion? Is it glue? Cement?
Ah, no! Again, it is law. And law is mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doctor&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; interrupted Haynerd.</p>
<p>The doctor held up a detaining hand. &ldquo;Let me finish,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Now we have the very latest word from our physical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_63' name='book4_page_63'></a>63</span>
scientists regarding the constitution of matter: <i>it is composed
of electric charges, held together by law.</i> Again, you may
justly ask: Is matter material&ndash;&ndash;or mental?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again, and took up a book that lay before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I hold a solid, material, lumpy
thing, composed, you will say, of matter. And yet, in essence,
and if we can believe our scientists, this book is composed of
billions of electric charges&ndash;&ndash;invisible things, without form,
without weight, without color, without extension, held together
by law, and making up a material object which has mass, color,
weight, and extension. From millions of things which are
invisible and have no size, we get an object, visible and extended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted,&rdquo; interposed Hitt. &ldquo;Yet, the doctor is giving the
very latest deductions of the great scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doctor,&rdquo; said Father Waite, &ldquo;the scientists tell us
that they have experimental evidence in support of the theories
which you have stated regarding the composition of matter.
Electricity has been proven granular, or atomic, in structure.
And every electrical charge consists of an exact number of
electrical atoms spread out over the surface of the charged
body. All this admits of definite calculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admitted,&rdquo; said Hitt, taking up the challenge. &ldquo;And their
very calculations and deductions are rapidly wearing away the
&lsquo;materialistic theory&rsquo; of matter. You will admit that mathematics
is wholly confined to the realm of mind. It is a strictly
mental science, in no way material. It loses definiteness when
&lsquo;practically&rsquo; applied to material objects. Kant saw this, and
declared that a science might be regarded as further removed
from or nearer to perfection in proportion to the amount of
mathematics it contained. Now there has been an astonishing
confirmation of this great truth just lately. At a banquet given
in honor of the discoverer of wireless telegraphy it was stated
that the laws governing the traversing of space by the invisible
electric waves were more exact than the general laws of physics,
where very complex formulas and coefficients are required for
correcting the general laws, due to surrounding material conditions.
The greater exactness of laws governing the invisible
electric waves was said to be due to the absence of matter.
And it was further stated that <i>whenever matter had to be taken
into consideration there could be no exact law of action!&rdquo;</i>
&ldquo;Which shows&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That matter admits of no definite laws,&rdquo; replied Hitt.
&ldquo;That there are no real laws of matter. And that definiteness
is attained only as we dematerialize matter itself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_64' name='book4_page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, get into the realm of the mental?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. And now for the application. I have said that
we do not receive any testimony whatsoever through the so-called
material senses, but that we see, hear, feel, taste, and
smell our own thoughts&ndash;&ndash;that is, the thoughts which, from
some source, come into our mentalities. Very well, our scientists
show us that, as they get farther away from dense material
thoughts, and deal more and more with those which have
less material structure, less material composition, their laws
become more definite, more exact. Following this out to its
ultimate conclusion, we may say, then, that <i>only those laws
which have to do with the non-material are perfect</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;are the laws of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! And now the history of physical science shows
that there has been a constant deviation from the old so-called
fixed &lsquo;laws of matter.&rsquo; The law of impenetrability has had to
go. A great physicist tells us that, when dealing with sufficiently
high speeds, matter has no such property as impenetrability.
Mass is a function of velocity. The law of indestructibility
has had to go. Matter deteriorates and goes to pieces.
The material elements are not fixed. The decided tendency of
belief is toward a single element, of which all matter is composed,
and of which the eighty-odd constituent elements of
matter accepted to-day are but modifications. That unit element
may be the ether, of course. And the great Russian
chemist, Mendeleef, so believed. But to us, the ether is a
mental thing, a theory. But, granting its existence, <i>its universal
penetrability renders matter, as we know it, non-existent</i>.
Everything reduces to the ether, in the final analysis.
And all energy becomes vibrations in and of the ether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ether,&rdquo; supplemented the doctor, &ldquo;has to be without
mass, invisible, tasteless, intangible, much more rigid than
steel, and at the same time some six hundred billion times
lighter than air, in order to fulfill all the requirements made
of it and to meet all conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and yet the ether is a very necessary theory, if we
are going to continue to explain the phenomena of force on a
material basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we abandon that basis&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;matter reduces to what it really is,
the human mind&rsquo;s <i>interpretation</i> of substance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hitt, turning to her; &ldquo;I think you are right;
matter is the way real substance&ndash;&ndash;let us say, spirit&ndash;&ndash;looks to
the human mentality. It is the way the human mind interprets
its ideas of spirit. In other words, the human mind looks
at the material thoughts and ideas which enter it, and calls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_65' name='book4_page_65'></a>65</span>
them solid substance, occupying space&ndash;&ndash;calls them matter, with
definite laws, and, in certain forms, containing life and intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, that is it!&rdquo; said Father Waite. &ldquo;And that has been
the terrible mistake of the ages, the one great error, the one
lie, that has caused us all to miss the mark and come short,
far short, of the glory of the mind that is God. <i>There is the
origin of the problem of evil!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;For evil is in essence but
evil thought. And evil thought is invariably associated with
matter. The origin of all evil is matter itself. And matter,
we find, is but a mental concept, a thing of thought. Oh, the
irony of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; put in Haynerd, who had been twitching nervously
in his chair, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get to the conclusion of this very learned
discussion. I&rsquo;m a plain man, and I&rsquo;d like to know just where
we&rsquo;ve landed. What have you said that I can take home with
me? The earth still revolves around the sun, even if it is a
mean mud ball. And I can&rsquo;t see that I can get along with less
than three square meals a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have arrived,&rdquo; replied Hitt gravely, &ldquo;at a most momentous
conclusion, deduced by the physical scientists themselves,
namely, that <i>things are not what they seem</i>. In other
words, all things material seem to reduce to vibrations in and
of the ether; the basis of all materiality is energy, motion,
activity&ndash;&ndash;mental things. All the elements of matter seem to
be but modifications of one all-pervading element. That element
is probably the ether, often called the &lsquo;mother of matter.&rsquo;
The elements, such as carbon, silicon, and the others, are not
elementary at all, but are forms of one universal element, the
ether. Hence, atoms are not atoms. The so-called rare elements
are rare only because their lives are short. They disintegrate
rapidly and change into other forms of the universal
element&ndash;&ndash;or disappear. &lsquo;Atoms are but fleeting phases of matter,&rsquo;
we are told. They are by no means eternal, even though
they may endure for millions of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s?&rdquo; commented Haynerd with a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great scientist of our own day,&rdquo; Hitt continued, &ldquo;has
said that &lsquo;the ether is so modified as to constitute matter, in
some way.&rsquo; What does that mean? Simply that &lsquo;visible matter
and invisible ether are one and the same thing.&rsquo; But to the
five so-called physical senses the ether is utterly incomprehensible.
So, then, matter is wholly incomprehensible to the
five physical senses. What is it, then, that we call matter?
It can be nothing more than the human mind&rsquo;s interpretation
of its idea of an all-pervading, omnipresent <i>something</i>, a something
which represents substance to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_66' name='book4_page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me add a further quotation from the great physical
scientist to whom you have referred,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;He
has said that the ether is <i>not</i> matter, but that it is material.
And further, that we can not deny that the ether may have
some mental and spiritual functions to subserve in some other
order of existence, as matter has in this. It is wholly unrelated
to any of our senses. The sense of sight takes cognizance of
it, but only in a very indirect and not easily recognized way.
And yet&ndash;&ndash;stupendous conclusion!&ndash;&ndash;<i>without the ether there
could be no material universe at all</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;the whole fabric of the material
universe depends upon something utterly unrecognizable
by the five physical senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; concluded Hitt, &ldquo;the physical senses give us no
information whatsoever of a real physical universe about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; added Father Waite, &ldquo;we come back to Carmen&rsquo;s
statement, namely, that seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and
feeling are mental processes, in no way dependent upon the
outer fleshly organs of sense&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; interjected Haynerd. &ldquo;Why is it, then, that if
the eyes are destroyed we do not see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply, my friend, because of human belief,&rdquo; replied Hitt.
&ldquo;The human mind has been trained for untold centuries to dependence
upon beliefs in the reality of matter, and beliefs in
its dependence upon material modes for sight, hearing, touch,
and so on. It is because of its erroneous beliefs that the human
mind is to-day enslaved by matter, and dependent upon it for
its very sense of existence. The human mind has made its
sense of sight dependent upon a frail, pulpy bit of flesh, the
eye. As long as that fleshly organ remains intact, the human
mind sees its sense of sight externalized in the positing of its
mental concepts about it as natural objects. But let that
fleshly eye be destroyed, and the human mind sees its belief
of dependence upon the material eye externalized as blindness.
When the fleshly eye is gone the mind declares that it can no
longer see. And what it declares as truth, as fact, becomes
externalized to it. I repeat, the human mind sees and hears
only its thoughts, its beliefs. And holding to these beliefs,
and making them real to itself, it eventually sees them externalized
in what it calls its outer world, its environment, its
universe. And yet, the materialistic scientists themselves show
that the human mind can take no cognizance whatever through
the five physical senses of the all-pervading basis of its very
existence, the ether. And the ether&ndash;&ndash;alas! it is but a theory
which we find necessary for any intelligible explanation of the
farce of human existence on a material basis.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_67' name='book4_page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here!&rdquo; retorted Haynerd, rising and giving expression
to his protest by means of emphatic gestures. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
getting mixed&ndash;&ndash;badly! You tell me that the existence of things
demands a creator, and I admit it, for there can be no effect
without a cause. Then you say that the universe is infinite;
and I admit that, too, for the science of astronomy finds no
limits to space, and no space unoccupied. You say that the
unity manifested in the universe proves that there can be but
one creator. Moreover, to create an infinite universe there
must needs be an omnipotent creator; and there can be but one
who is omnipotent. I cordially agree. Further, I can see how
that creator must be mind&ndash;&ndash;infinite mind. And I can see why
that mind must be absolutely perfect, with no intelligence of
evil whatsoever, else would it be a house divided against itself.
And such a house must eventually fall. Now I admit that the
universe must be the manifestation, the expression, of that
infinite creative mind. But&ndash;&ndash;and here&rsquo;s the sticking point&ndash;&ndash;the
universe is both good and evil! Hence, the mind which
it manifests is likewise both good and evil&ndash;&ndash;and the whole
pretty theory blows up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down abruptly, with the air of having given finality
to a perplexing question.</p>
<p>All eyes then turned to Carmen, who slowly rose and surveyed
the little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not surprising,&rdquo; she said, smiling at the confused
Haynerd, &ldquo;that difficulties arise when you attempt to reach
God through human reasoning&ndash;&ndash;spirit through matter. You
have taken the unreal, and, through it, have sought to reach
back to the real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interrupted Haynerd testily, &ldquo;kindly explain the
difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, first,&rdquo; replied Carmen, &ldquo;let us adopt some common
meeting ground, some basis which we can all accept, and from
which we can rise. Are you all agreed that, in our every-day
life, everything is mental?&ndash;&ndash;every action?&ndash;&ndash;every object?&ndash;&ndash;and
that, as the philosopher Mill said, &lsquo;Everything is a feeling of
which the mind is conscious&rsquo;? Let me illustrate my meaning,&rdquo;
she continued, noting Haynerd&rsquo;s rising protest. &ldquo;I see this
book; I take it up; and drop it upon the table. Have I really
seen a book? No; I have been conscious of thoughts which I
call a book, nothing more. A real material book did not get
into my mind; but <i>thoughts</i> of a book did. And the activity
of such thought resulted in a state of consciousness&ndash;&ndash;for consciousness
is mental activity, the activity of thought. Remember
that, even according to your great physical scientists, this
book is composed of millions of charges of electricity, or electrons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_68' name='book4_page_68'></a>68</span>
moving at a tremendously high rate of speed. And yet,
regardless of its composition, I am conscious only of my
thoughts of the book. It is but my thoughts that I see, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and waited for the protest which was not voiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, continuing; &ldquo;so it is with the sense
of touch; I had the thought of touching it, and that thought I
saw; I was conscious of it when it became active in my mentality.
So with sound; when I let the book drop, I was conscious
of my thought of sound. If the book had been dropped
in a vacuum I should not have been conscious of a thought of
sound&ndash;&ndash;why? Because, as Mr. Hitt has told us, the human
mind has made its sense-testimony dependent upon vibrations.
And yet, there is a clock ticking up there on the wall. Do
you hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Haynerd; &ldquo;now that you&rsquo;ve called my attention
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;You hear it when your
thought is directed to it. And yet the air was vibrating all the
time, and, if hearing is dependent upon the fleshly ear, you
should have heard it incessantly when you were not thinking
of it, as well as you hear it now when you are thinking of it.
Am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps so,&rdquo; assented Haynerd with some reluctance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hear, see, and feel,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;when our
thought is directed to these processes. And the processes are
wholly mental&ndash;&ndash;they take place within our mentalities&ndash;&ndash;and
it is there, within our minds, that we see, hear, and feel <i>all</i>
things. And it is there, within our minds, that the universe
exists for us. It is there that we hold our world, our fleshly
bodies, everything that we call material. <i>The universe that we
think we see all about us consists of the mental concepts, made
up of thought, which we hold within our mentalities</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd nodded somewhat dubiously. Carmen proceeded
with the exposition of her theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence come these material thoughts that are within us?
And are they real? Can we control them? And how? They
are real to us, at any rate, are they not? And if they are
thoughts of pain and suffering and death, they are terribly real
to us. But let us see, now that we can reason from the basis
of the mental nature of all things. We have agreed that the
creative principle is mind, and we call it God. This infinite
mind constantly expresses and manifests itself in ideas. Why,
that is a fundamental law of mind! You express yourself in
your ideas and thoughts, which you try to externalize materially.
But the infinite mind expresses itself in an infinite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_69' name='book4_page_69'></a>69</span>
number and variety of ideas, all, like itself, pure, perfect,
eternal, good, without any elements or seeds of decay or discord.
And the incessant expression of the creative mind in
and through its numberless ideas constitutes the never-ending
process of creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me add here,&rdquo; interrupted Hitt, &ldquo;that the Bible states
that God created the heavens and earth in seven days. But
numbers, we must remember, were mystical things to the
ancient Hebrews, and were largely used symbolically. The
number seven, for example, was used to express wholeness,
completeness. So we must remember that its use in Genesis
has a much wider meaning than its absurd theological interpretation
into seven solar days. As Carmen says, the infinite
creative mind can never cease to express itself; creation can
never cease; and creation is but the whole, complete revelation
or unfoldment of infinite mind&rsquo;s ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And infinite mind,&rdquo; continued Carmen, &ldquo;requires infinite
time in which to completely express itself. So time ceases to
be, and we find that all real things exist now, in an endless
present. Now, the ideas of infinite mind range throughout the
realm of infinity, but the greatest idea that the creative mind
can have is the idea of itself. That idea is the image and likeness
of the infinite creative mind. It is the perfect reflection
of that mind&ndash;&ndash;its perfect expression. That idea is what the
man Jesus always saw back of the human concept of man.
<i>That idea is the real man</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a different
proposition from the mud-men that I do business with daily.
What are they? Children of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were real,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;they would have to be
children of God. But then they would not be &lsquo;mud-men.&rsquo; Now
I have just spoken of the real, the spiritual creation. That is
the creation mentioned in the first chapter of Genesis, where
all was created&ndash;&ndash;revealed, unfolded&ndash;&ndash;by God, and He saw that
it was perfect, good. &lsquo;In the beginning,&rsquo; says the commentator.
That is, &lsquo;To begin with&ndash;&ndash;God.&rsquo; Everything begins with God
in the realm of the real. The creative mind is first. And the
creation, or unfoldment, is like its creative principle, eternal
and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Haynerd, &ldquo;how about the material man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having created all things spiritually,&rdquo; continued the girl,
&ldquo;was it necessary that the creative mind should repeat its
work, do it over again, and produce the man of dust described
in the second chapter of Genesis? Is that second account of
the creation an inspiration of truth&ndash;&ndash;or a human comment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it what you will,&rdquo; said the cynical Haynerd; &ldquo;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_70' name='book4_page_70'></a>70</span>
fact remains that the mud-man exists and has to be reckoned
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of your premises are wholly incorrect,&rdquo; returned the
girl gently. &ldquo;He does <i>not</i> exist, excepting in human, mortal
thought. He is a product of only such thought. He and his
material universe are seen and dealt with only in such thought.
And such thought is the direct antithesis of God&rsquo;s thought.
And it is therefore unreal. It is the supposition, the lie, the
mist that went up and darkened the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the human man&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is just what you have said, a hue of a man, a dark hue,
the shadowy opposite which seems to counterfeit the real,
spiritual man and claim all his attributes. He is not a compound
of mind and matter, for we have seen that all things are
mental, even matter itself. He is a sort of mentality, a counterfeit
of real mind. His body and his universe are in himself.
And, like all that is unreal, he is transient, passing, ephemeral,
mortal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, God made him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for he does not exist, excepting in supposition. Does
a supposition really exist? If so, then not even truth can destroy
it. But supposition passes out before truth. No, the
human mind is the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; of Paul. He is to be put off by
knowing his nothingness, and by knowing the unreality of his
supposed material environment and universe. As he goes out
of consciousness, the real man, the idea of God, perfect, harmonious,
and eternal, comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; said Father Waite impressively, &ldquo;you have
the whole scheme of salvation, as enunciated by the man
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of it,&rdquo; added Hitt. &ldquo;And, oh, my friends!
how futile, how base, how worse than childish now appear the
whole theological fabric of the churches, their foolish man-made
dogmas, their insensate beliefs in a fiery hell and a golden
heaven. Oh, how belittling now appear their concepts of God&ndash;&ndash;a
God who can damn unbaptised infants, who can predestine
his children to eternal sorrow, who creates and then curses his
handiwork! Do you wonder that sin, sorrow, and death remain
among us while such awful beliefs hold sway over the
human mind? God help us, and the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd, who had been sitting quietly for some moments,
deep in thought, rose and held out his hands, as if in entreaty.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear any more. I want
to think it all over. It seems&ndash;&ndash;it seems as if a curtain had
been raised suddenly. And what I see beyond is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen went swiftly to the man and slipped an arm about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_71' name='book4_page_71'></a>71</span>
him. &ldquo;That infinite creative Mind, so misunderstood and misinterpreted
by human beings, is back of you,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;And it is Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd turned and grasped her hands. &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;But had I not seen the proof in you, no amount
of reasoning would have convinced me.&rdquo; And, bowing to the
little group, he went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Hitt, turning inquiringly to the doctor.</p>
<p>The latter raised his head. &ldquo;If these things are true,&rdquo; he
made answer slowly, &ldquo;then I shall have to recast my entire
mentality, my whole basis of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just what you <i>must</i> do, Doctor, if you would work out
your salvation,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;Jesus said we must repent if
we would be saved. Repentance&ndash;&ndash;the Greek <i>metanoia</i>&ndash;&ndash;means
a complete and radical change of thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;do you mean to say that the whole world has been
mistaken? That the entire human race has been deceived for
ages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;it was only in our own day, comparatively
speaking, that the human race was undeceived in regard
to the world being round. And there are thousands of human
beings to-day who still believe in witchcraft, and who worship
the sun and moon, and whose lives are wholly under the spell
of superstition. Human character, a great scientist tells us,
has not changed since history began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t revamp our thought-processes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must go on missing the mark, sinning, suffering,
sorrowing, and dying, over and over and over again, until we
decide that we can do so,&rdquo; said Hitt.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at Carmen and met that same smile of
unbounded love which she gave without stint to a sin-weary
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll come again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When? To-morrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carmen, rising and coming around to him.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; in a whisper, &ldquo;bring Pat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>
</div>
<p>The Social Era had for many years made its weekly appearance
every Saturday morning, that its fashionable
clientele might appease their jaded appetites on the Sabbath
day by nibbling at its spicy pabulum. But, though the
Ames reception had fallen on a Saturday night, the following
Friday morning found the columns of the Era still awaiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_72' name='book4_page_72'></a>72</span>
a report of the notable affair. For Haynerd&rsquo;s hand seemed
paralyzed. Whenever he set his pen to the task, there loomed
before him only the scene in the little waiting room, and he
could write of nothing else. He found himself still dwelling
upon the awful contrast between the slender wisp of a girl
and her mountainous opponent, as they had stood before him;
and the terrifying thoughts of what was sure to follow in consequence
drenched his skin with cold perspiration.</p>
<p>On the desk before him lay the essay which he had asked
Carmen to write during the week, as her report of the brilliant
event. He had read it through three times, and each time had
read into it a new meaning. He dared not run it. Not that it
ridiculed or condemned&ndash;&ndash;at least, not openly&ndash;&ndash;but because
every one of its crisp comments admitted of an interpretation
which revealed the hidden depths of the social system, and its
gigantic incarnation, as if under the glare of a powerful searchlight.
It was in no sense a muck-raking exposition. Rather,
it was an interpretation, and a suggestion. It was, too, a prediction;
but not a curse. The girl loved those about whom she
wrote. And yet, he who read the essay aright would learn
that her love stopped not at the flimsy veil of the flesh, but
penetrated until it rested upon the fair spiritual image beyond.
And then Haynerd saw that the essay was, in substance, a social
clinic, to which all searchers after truth were bidden, that they
might learn a great lesson from her skillful dissection of the
human mind, and her keen analysis of its constituent thought.</p>
<p>As he sat wrapped in reflection, the early morning mail was
brought in. He glanced up, and then started to his feet. The
letters spread over his desk like an avalanche of snow; and
the puffing mail carrier declared that he had made a special
trip with them alone. Haynerd began to tear them open, one
after another. Then he called the office boy, and set him at
the task. There were more than five hundred of them, and
each contained a canceled subscription to the Social Era.</p>
<p>A dark foreboding settled down over Haynerd&rsquo;s mind. He
rose and went to the card-index to consult his subscription
list. It was gone! He stood confusedly for a moment, then
hastened to the window that looked out upon a fire-escape. Its
lock lay broken upon the floor. He turned and rushed to the
vault, which, reflecting his own habitual carelessness, was
never locked. His ledgers and account books were not there.
Then he crept back to his desk and sank into a chair.</p>
<p>The noon mail brought more letters of like nature, until
the office boy tallied nearly eight hundred. Then Haynerd,
as if rousing from a dream, reached for the telephone and
summoned Hitt to his rescue. The Social Era was foundering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_73' name='book4_page_73'></a>73</span>
Its mailing list had contained some fifteen hundred names.
The subscription price was twelve dollars a year&ndash;&ndash;and never,
to his knowledge, had it been paid in advance by his ultra-rich
patrons, most of whom were greatly in arrears. Haynerd
saw it all vanishing now as quietly as the mist fades before
the summer sun.</p>
<p>Within an hour the wondering Hitt was in conference with
him, and Haynerd had told the story of the theft, of the Ames
bribe, and the encounter following. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;can
Ames kill my entire subscription list, and in a single week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily,&rdquo; replied Hitt, &ldquo;and in any one of several ways.
Apparently he had caused your subscription list and books to
be stolen. Your sun has set, Ned. Or, rather, Ames has lifted
it bodily from the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll shoot him! I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;! But we&rsquo;ve got the goods on
him! Carmen and I saw him bribe Wales! We&rsquo;ll expose him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;Forget all that,&rdquo; he said, laying a hand
on the excited man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Remember, that Wales would
never dare breathe a word of it; Carmen has no reputation or
standing whatsoever now in this city; and Ames would make
out a case of blackmail against you so quickly that it would
sweep you right into the Tombs. Go easy. And first, let us get
the girl herself down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the telephone and called up several of the University
departments, after first ascertaining that she was not at
her home. Then, having located her, he plunged into a study
of the situation with the distracted publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it!&rdquo; cried Haynerd at length. &ldquo;Here I
waste my evenings in learned philosophical discussions with
you people, and meantime, while we&rsquo;re figuring out that there
is no evil, that monster, Ames, stretches out a tentacle and
strangles me! Fine practical discussions we&rsquo;ve been having,
ain&rsquo;t they? I tell you, I&rsquo;m through with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; He brought his
fist down upon the desk with a crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am!&rdquo; shouted Haynerd. &ldquo;Do I deny it? Here I
had a nice, clean business, no work, good pay&ndash;&ndash;and, just because
I associated with you and that girl, the whole damn
thing goes up the flue! Pays to be good, doesn&rsquo;t it? Nix!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m; well, Ned, you&rsquo;re not only a fool, but a blooming
idiot,&rdquo; replied Hitt calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay it on! Lay it on thick!&rdquo; roared Haynerd. &ldquo;And if
you run out of epithets, I&rsquo;ll supply a few! I&rsquo;m a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door swung open, and Carmen entered, fresh as the sea
breeze, and panting with her haste. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she
began eagerly, &ldquo;two men followed me all the way down from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_74' name='book4_page_74'></a>74</span>
the University! They watched me come in here, and&ndash;&ndash;but,
what is wrong with you two?&rdquo; She stopped and looked inquiringly
from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Hitt hesitatingly, &ldquo;we were reflecting&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reflecting? What? Good, or evil?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just holding a wake, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; muttered Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wake up!&rdquo; she cried, seizing his hand.</p>
<p>Hitt pushed out a chair for the girl, and bade her sit down.
Then he briefly related the events which had led to her being
summoned. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the question is, does
Wales know that you and Ned saw Ames try to bribe him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course he knows!&rdquo; cried Carmen. &ldquo;His wife told
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who informed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did&ndash;&ndash;last Monday morning, early,&rdquo; answered the wondering
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd, turning upon Hitt
and waving his arms about. &ldquo;What do you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Ned!&rdquo; interrupted Hitt. Then, to Carmen,
&ldquo;Why did you tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;to save her, and her husband, and babies! I told
her because it was right! You know it was right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, to save them, you have ruined Ned,&rdquo; pursued Hitt.</p>
<p>The girl turned to Haynerd, who sat doubled up in his
chair, the picture of despair. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t ruined you, Ned.&rdquo;
It was the first time she had used this name in addressing him.
&ldquo;Things never happen, you know. And if you have been
pushed out of this business, it is because it isn&rsquo;t fit for you,
and because you&rsquo;ve been awakened. You are for higher, better
things than the publishing of such a magazine as the Social
Era. I knew you just couldn&rsquo;t stay at this work. You have
got to go up&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; Haynerd had roused out of his torpor. &ldquo;Go up?
Yes, I&rsquo;ve gone up, nicely! And I was making ten thousand
dollars a year out of it! It was a bully proposition!&rdquo; he
blurted.</p>
<p>The girl smiled. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t speaking of money,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was!&rdquo; retorted Haynerd. &ldquo;When I talk, it&rsquo;s in dollars
and cents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why your talk is mostly nonsense,&rdquo; put in Hitt.
&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s right, I guess. You&rsquo;ve stagnated here long enough,
Ned. There&rsquo;s no such thing as standing still. Progress is a
divine demand. It&rsquo;s now your move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;good Lord! what am I to do?&rdquo; wailed the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You now have a grand opportunity,&rdquo; said Carmen, taking
his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_75' name='book4_page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; every trial in this life is an opportunity to prove
that there is no evil,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Listen; you have been trained
as a publisher. Very well, the world is waiting for the right
kind of publications. Oh, I&rsquo;ve seen it for a long, long time.
The demand is simply tremendous. Now meet it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd looked confusedly from Carmen to Hitt. The
latter turned to the girl. &ldquo;What, exactly, do you mean, Carmen?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him publish now a clean magazine, or paper; let him
print real news; let him work, not for rich people&rsquo;s money, but
for all people. Why, the press is the greatest educator in the
world! But, oh, how it has been abused! Now let him come
out boldly and stand for clean journalism. Let him find his
own life, his own good, in service for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Carmen,&rdquo; protested Hitt, &ldquo;do the people want clean
journalism? Could such a paper stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could, if it had the right thought back of it,&rdquo; returned
the confident girl.</p>
<p>Haynerd had again lapsed into sulky silence. But Hitt
pondered the girl&rsquo;s words for some moments. She was not the
first nor the only one who had voiced such sentiments. He
himself had even dared to hold the same thoughts, and to
read in them a leading that came not from material ambitions.
Then, of a sudden, an idea flamed up in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Carmen waited expectantly. Hitt&rsquo;s eyes widened with his
expanding thought. &ldquo;Carlson, editor of the Express, wants to
sell,&rdquo; he continued, speaking rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a semi-weekly newspaper, printed only for country
circulation; has no subscription list,&rdquo; commented Haynerd,
with a cynical shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy it!&rdquo; exclaimed Carmen. &ldquo;Buy it! And change it into
a daily! Make it a real newspaper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt looked into Carmen&rsquo;s glowing eyes. &ldquo;How old are
you?&rdquo; he suddenly asked. The abruptness of the strange, apparently
irrelevant question startled the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she replied slowly, &ldquo;as old as&ndash;&ndash;as God. And as
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as human beings reckon time, eighteen, eh?&rdquo; continued
Hitt.</p>
<p>She nodded, wondering what the question meant. Hitt
then turned to Haynerd. &ldquo;How much money can you scrape
together, if you sell this lot of junk?&rdquo; he asked, sweeping the
place with a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five or six thousand, all told, including bank account,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_76' name='book4_page_76'></a>76</span>
bonds, and everything, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Haynerd mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlson wants forty thousand for the Express. I&rsquo;m not a
rich man, as wealth is estimated to-day, but&ndash;&ndash;well, oil is still
flowing down in Ohio. It isn&rsquo;t the money&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s back
of the cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen reached over and laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;We
can do it,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Hitt hesitated a moment longer, then sprang to his feet.
&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pondered and studied this
scheme for a year, but I&rsquo;ve only to-day seen the right help.
That is your tremendous, driving thought,&rdquo; he said, turning to
Carmen. &ldquo;That thought is a spiritual dynamite, that will blast
its way through every material obstacle! Ned,&rdquo; seizing Haynerd
by the shoulder and shaking him out of his chair, &ldquo;rouse
up! Your light has come! Now I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;phone Carlson right away
and make an appointment to talk business with him. You&rsquo;ll
stand with me, Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd blinked for a few moments, like an owl in the
light. But then, as a comprehension of Hitt&rsquo;s plan dawned
upon his waking thought, he straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy the Express! Make a real paper of it! A&ndash;&ndash;but
Ames?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t touch us! The clientele of the Express will not
be made up of his puppets! Our paper will be for the people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;your University work, Hitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give my last lecture next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only biding my time,&rdquo; she replied gently. &ldquo;This is
a real call. And my answer is: Here am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears began to trickle slowly down Haynerd&rsquo;s cheeks, as
the tension in his nerves slackened. He rose and seized the
hands of his two friends. &ldquo;Hitt,&rdquo; he said, in a choking voice,
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I said I was a fool. But that fellow&rsquo;s dead now. The real
man has waked up, and&ndash;&ndash;well, what are you standing there for,
you great idiot? Go and call up Carlson!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Again that evening the little group sat about the table in
the dining room of the Beaubien cottage. But only the three
most directly concerned, and the Beaubien, knew that the
owner of the Express had received that afternoon an offer for
the purchase of his newspaper, and that he had been given
twenty-four hours in which to accept it. Doctor Morton was
again present; and beside him sat his lifelong friend and jousting-mate,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_77' name='book4_page_77'></a>77</span>
the very Reverend Patterson Moore. Hitt took the
floor, and began speaking low and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in conjunction with what
we have deduced regarding the infinite creative mind and its
manifestations, that we mortals in our daily mundane existence
deal only and always with phenomena, with appearances,
with effects, and never with ultimate causes. And so all our
material knowledge is a knowledge of appearances only. Of
the ultimate essence of things, the human mind knows nothing.
All of its knowledge is relative. A phenomenon may be
so-and-so with regard to another; but that either is absolute
truth we can not affirm. And yet&ndash;&ndash;mark this well&ndash;&ndash;as Spencer
says, &lsquo;Every one of the arguments by which the relativity of
our knowledge is demonstrated distinctly postulates the positive
existence of something beyond the relative.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just what does that mean?&rdquo; asked Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a primitive statement of what is sometimes called
the &lsquo;Theory of suppositional opposites&rsquo;&rdquo;, replied Hitt. &ldquo;It
means that to every reality there is the corresponding unreality.
For every truth there may be postulated the supposition. We
can not, as the great philosopher says, conceive that our knowledge
is a knowledge of appearances only, without at the same
time conceiving a reality of which they are appearances. He
further amplifies this by saying that &lsquo;every positive notion&ndash;&ndash;the
concept of a thing by what it is&ndash;&ndash;suggests a negative notion&ndash;&ndash;the
concept of a thing by what it is not. But, though
these mutually suggest each other, <i>the positive alone is real</i>.&rsquo;
Most momentous language, that! For, interpreted, it means:
we must deny the seeming, or that which appears to human
sense, in order to see that which is real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Wall, glancing about to
note the effect of the speaker&rsquo;s words on the others.</p>
<p>But Carmen nodded her thorough agreement, and added:
&ldquo;Did not Jesus say that we must deny ourselves? Deny which
self? Why, the self that appears to us, the matter-man, the
dust-man, the man of the second chapter of Genesis. We must
deny his reality, and know that he is nothing but a mental
concept, formed out of suppositional thought, out of dust-thought.
And that is material thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly correct,&rdquo; said Hitt, turning to Carmen. &ldquo;But,
before we consider the astonishing teachings of Jesus, let us
sum up the conclusions of philosophy. To begin with, then,
there is a First Cause, omnipotent and omnipresent, and of
very necessity perfect. That Cause lies back of all the phenomena
of life; and, because of its real existence, there arises
the suppositional existence of its opposite, its negative, so to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_78' name='book4_page_78'></a>78</span>
speak, which is unreal. The phenomena of human existence
have to do <i>only</i> with the suppositional existence of the great
First Cause&rsquo;s opposite. They are a reflection of that supposition.
Hence all human knowledge of an external world is but
phenomenal, and consists of appearances which have no more
real substance than have shadows. <i>We, as mortals, know but
the shadowy, phenomenal existence.</i> <i>We do not know reality.</i>
<i>Therefore, our knowledge is not real knowledge, but supposition.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he went on hastily, for he saw an expression of
protest on Reverend Moore&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;we are more or less familiar
with a phenomenal existence, with appearances, with effects;
and our knowledge of these is entirely mental. We see all
things as thought. These thoughts, such as feeling, seeing,
hearing, and so on, we ignorantly attribute to the five physical
senses. This is what Ruskin calls the &lsquo;pathetic fallacy.&rsquo; And
because we do so, we find ourselves absolutely dependent upon
these senses&ndash;&ndash;in belief. Moreover, quoting Spencer again, only
the absolutely real is the absolutely persistent, or enduring.
Truth, for example. The truth of the multiplication table will
endure eternally. It is real. But is it any whit material?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Miss Wall, speaking for the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, as regards material objects which we seem to see and
touch,&rdquo; went on Hitt, &ldquo;we appear to see solidity and hardness,
and we conceive as real objects what are only the mental signs
or indications of objects. Remember, matter does not and can
not get into the mind. Only thoughts and ideas enter our
mentalities. We see our <i>thoughts</i> of hardness, solidity, and
so on; and these thoughts point to something that is real. That
<i>something</i> is&ndash;&ndash;what? I repeat: <i>the ideas of the infinite creative
Mind</i>. The thoughts of size, shape, hardness, and so on,
which we group together and call material chairs, trees, mountains,
and other objects, are but &lsquo;relative realities,&rsquo; pointing
to the absolute reality, infinite mind and its eternal ideas
and thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again for comments. But all seemed absorbed in
his statements. Then he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our concept of matter, which is now proven to be but a
mental concept, built up out of false thought, points to <i>mind</i>
as the real substance. Our concept of measurable space and
distance is the direct opposite of the great truth that infinite
mind is ever-present. Our concept of time is the opposite of
infinity. It is but human limitation. Age is the opposite of
eternity&ndash;&ndash;and the old-age thought brings extinction. So, <i>to
every reality there is the corresponding unreality</i>. The opposite
of good is evil. If the infinite creative mind is good&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_79' name='book4_page_79'></a>79</span>
we saw that by very necessity it <i>must</i> be so&ndash;&ndash;then evil becomes
an awful unreality, and is real only to the false thought which
entertains or holds it. If life is real&ndash;&ndash;and infinite mind must
itself be life&ndash;&ndash;then death becomes the opposite unreality. And,
as Jesus said, it can be overcome. But were it real, <i>no power</i>,
<i>divine or human</i>, <i>could ever overcome or destroy it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; remarked Haynerd dryly, &ldquo;that our study
so far simply goes to show, as Burke puts it, &lsquo;what shadows
we are and what shadows we pursue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt smiled. &ldquo;When the world humiliates itself to the point
that it will accept that, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then it will become
receptive to truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now let us go a little further,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The
great Lamarck voiced a mighty fact when he said, &lsquo;Function
precedes structure.&rsquo; For by that we mean that the egg did
not produce the bird, but the bird the egg. The world seems
about to pass from the very foolish belief that physical structure
is the cause of life, to the great fact that a <i>sense</i> of life
produces the physical structure. The former crude belief enslaved
man to his body. The latter tends to free him from
such slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Doctor,&rdquo; interrupted Carmen, &ldquo;the brain which
you were cutting up the other day did not make poor Yorick&rsquo;s
mind and thought, but his mind made the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled and shook a warning finger at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body,&rdquo; resumed Hitt, &ldquo;is a manifestation of the human
mind&rsquo;s activity. What constitutes the difference between a
bird and a steam engine? This, in part: the engine is made
by human hands from without; the bird makes itself, that is,
its body, from within. So it is with the human body. But
the ignorant human mind&ndash;&ndash;ignorant <i>per se</i>&ndash;&ndash;falls a slave to
its own creation, the mental concept which it calls its physical
body, and which it pampers and pets and loves, until it can
cling to it no longer, because the mental concept, not being
based on any real principle, is forced to pass away, having
nothing but false thought to sustain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; interposed Haynerd, who was again waxing
impatient, &ldquo;just what is the practical application of all this
abstruse reasoning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very greatest imaginable, my friend,&rdquo; replied Hitt.
&ldquo;A real thing is real forever. And so matter can not become
non-existent <i>unless it is already nothing</i>! The world is beginning
to recognize the tremendous fact that from nothing nothing
can be made. Very well, since the law of the conservation
of energy seems to be established as regards energy <i>in toto</i>,
why, we must conclude that there is no such thing as <i>annihilation</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_80' name='book4_page_80'></a>80</span>
And that means that <i>there is no such thing as absolute
creation</i>! Whatever is real has always existed. The shadow
never was real, and does not exist. And so creation becomes
unfolding, or revelation, or development, of what already
exists, and has always existed, and always will exist. Therefore,
if matter, and all it includes as concomitants, evil, sin,
sickness, accident, chance, lack, and death, is based upon
unreal, false thought, then it can all be removed, put out of
consciousness, by a knowledge of truth and a reversal of our
accustomed human thought-processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;is salvation. It is based on
righteousness, which is right-thinking, thinking true thoughts,
and thinking truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And knowing,&rdquo; added Hitt, &ldquo;that evil, including matter, is
the suppositional opposite of truth. The doctrine of materialism
has been utterly disproved even by the physicists themselves.
For physicists have at last agreed that inertia is the
great essential property of matter. That is, matter is not a
cause, but an effect. It does not operate, but is operated upon.
It is not a law-giver, but is subject to the human mind&rsquo;s so-called
laws concerning it. It of itself is utterly without life or
intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Now Spencer said that matter
was a manifestation of an underlying power or force. Physicists
tell us that matter is made of electricity, that it is an
electrical phenomenon, and that the ultimate constituent of
matter is the electron. The electron is said by some to be made
up of superimposed layers of positive and negative electricity,
and by others to be made up of only negative charges. I
rather prefer the latter view, for if composed of only negative
electricity it is more truly a negation. Matter is the <i>negative</i>
of real substance. It is a sort of negative truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now electricity is a form of energy. Hence matter is a
form of energy also. But our comprehension of it is <i>wholly
mental</i>. Energy is mental. The only real energy there is or
can be is the energy of the infinite mind we call God. This the
human mind copies, or imitates, by reason of what has been
called &lsquo;the law of suppositional opposites,&rsquo; already dwelt upon
at some length. Everything manifests this so-called law. Electricity
is both positive and negative. Gravitation is regarded
by some physicists as the negative aspect of radiation-pressure,
the latter being the pressure supposed to be exerted by all
material bodies upon one another. The third law of motion
illustrates this so-called law, for it states that action and reaction
are equal and opposite. There can be no positive action
without a resultant negative one. The truth has its lie. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_81' name='book4_page_81'></a>81</span>
divine mind, God, has His opposite in the communal human,
or mortal, mind. The latter is manifested by the so-called
minds which we call mankind. And from these so-called
minds issue matter and material forms and bodies, with their
so-called material laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the material universe is running down. Stupendous
fact! The entire human concept is running down. Matter,
the human mental concept, is not eternally permanent.
Neither, therefore, are its concomitants, sin and discord. Matter
disintegrates and passes away&ndash;&ndash;out of human consciousness.
The whole material universe&ndash;&ndash;the so-called mortal-mind
concept&ndash;&ndash;is hastening to its death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as yet I think you have not given Mr. Haynerd the
practical application which he asks,&rdquo; suggested Father Waite,
as Hitt paused after his long exposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now ready for that,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;We have said
that the material is the relative. So all human knowledge is
relative. But, that being so, we can go a step further and add
that human error is likewise relative. And now&ndash;&ndash;startling
fact!&ndash;&ndash;<i>it is absolutely impossible to really know error</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; burst from the incredulous Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Hitt, turning to her. &ldquo;Can you know that two
plus two equals seven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me make this statement of truth: nothing can be
known definitely except as it is explained by the principle
which governs it. Now what principle governs an error,
whether that error be in music, mathematics, or life conduct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply to the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Hitt. &ldquo;Evil can not be really known.
And that is why God&ndash;&ndash;infinite Mind&ndash;&ndash;can not behold evil. And
now, friends, I have come to the conclusion of a long series of
deductions. If infinite mind is the cause and creator, that is,
the revealer, of all that really exists, its suppositional opposite,
its negative, must likewise simulate a creation, or revelation, or
unfolding, for this opposite must of very necessity pose as a creative
principle. It must simulate all the powers and attributes
of the infinite creative mind. If the creative mind gave rise to
a spiritual universe and spiritual man, by which it expresses
itself, then this suppositional opposite must present its universe
and its man, opposite in every particular to the reality.
<i>It is this sort of man and this sort of universe that we, as mortals,
seem to see all about us, and that we refer to as human
beings and the physical universe.</i> And yet, all that we see,
feel, hear, smell, or taste is the false, suppositional thought
that comes into our so-called mentalities, and by its suppositional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_82' name='book4_page_82'></a>82</span>
activity there causes what we call consciousness or
awareness of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Father Waite, more to enunciate his own
thought than to question the deduction, &ldquo;what the human consciousness
holds as knowledge is little more than belief and
speculation, with no basis of truth, no underlying principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. And it brings out the fruits of such beliefs in
discord, decay, and final dissolution, called death. For this
human consciousness forms its own concept of a fleshly body,
and a mind-and-matter man. It makes the laws which govern
its body, and it causes its body to obey these false laws. Upon
the quality of thought entering this human consciousness depend
all the phenomena of earthly life and environment which
the mortal experiences. The human consciousness, in other
words, is a <i>self-centered mass of erroneous thought, utterly
without any basis of real principle, but actively engaged in
building up mental images, and forming and maintaining an
environment in which it supposes itself to live</i>. <i>This false
thought in the human consciousness forms into a false concept
of man, and this is the soul-and-body man, the mind-and-matter
man, which is called a human being, or a mortal.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; commented Carmen, with a dreamy, far-away
look, &ldquo;we have what Padre Jos&egrave; so long ago spoke of as the
&lsquo;externalization of thought.&rsquo; It is the same law which Jesus
had in mind when he said, &lsquo;As a man thinketh in his heart, so
is he.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;For we know only what enters our mentalities
and becomes active there. And every thought that
does so enter, tends at once to become externalized. That is,
there is at once the tendency for us to see it visualized in some
way, either as material object, or environment, or on our
bodies. And it is the very activity of such thought that constitutes
the human mentality, as I have already said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that thought is continually changing,&rdquo; suggested
Father Waite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. Its very lack of true principle requires that it
should change constantly, in order to simulate as closely as
possible the real. That accounts for the fleeting character of
the whole human concept of man and the physical universe.
The human personality is never fixed, although the elements of
human character remain; that is, those elements which are
essentially unreal and mortal, such as lust, greed, hatred, and
materiality, seem to remain throughout the ages. They will
give way only before truth, even as Paul said. But not until
truth has been admitted to the human mentality and begins
its solvent work there, the work of denying and tearing down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_83' name='book4_page_83'></a>83</span>
the false thought-concepts and replacing them with true ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will truth come through the physical senses?&rdquo; asked
Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, decidedly no!&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;The physical senses testify
of nothing. Their supposed testimony is the material thought
which enters the human mentality and becomes active there,
resulting in human consciousness of both good and evil. And
that thought will have to give way to true thought, before we
can begin to put off the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; and put on the &lsquo;new.&rsquo; Human
thoughts, or, as we say, the physical senses, do not and
can not testify of absolute truth. They do not know God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd, rousing up. &ldquo;There goes the
Church, and original sin, and fallen man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such thing as &lsquo;fallen man,&rsquo; my friend,&rdquo; said
Hitt quietly. &ldquo;The spiritual man, the image and likeness, the
reflection, of the infinite creative mind, is perfect as long as its
principle remains perfect&ndash;&ndash;and that is eternally. The mortal
man never was perfect. He is a product of false, suppositional
thought. He is not and never was man. He did not fall, because
he has had no perfection to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverend Patterson Moore, who had sat a silent, though not
wholly sympathetic listener throughout the discussion, could
now no longer withhold his protest. &ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he abruptly
exclaimed, &ldquo;that there are so few deep convictions to-day concerning
the great essentials of Christianity! As I sit here and
listen to you belittle God and rend the great truths of His
Christ, as announced in His Word, the Bible, I am moved by
feelings poignantly sorrowful! The Christ has once been crucified;
and will you slay him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carmen, her eyes dilating with surprise, &ldquo;but
we would resurrect him! Don&rsquo;t you think you have kept him
in the tomb long enough? The Christ-principle is intended for
use, not for endless burial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? My dear Miss Carmen, it is I who preach the risen
Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You preach human theology, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; returned the
girl. &ldquo;And because of centuries of such preaching the world
has steadily sunk from the spiritual to the material, and lip
service has taken the place of that genuine spiritual worship
which knows no evil, and which, because of that practical
knowledge, heals the sick and raises the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insinuate that&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I state facts,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;Paul made some mistakes,
for he was consumed with zeal. But he stated truth
when he said that the second coming of Christ would occur
when the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; was put off. We have been discussing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_84' name='book4_page_84'></a>84</span>
&lsquo;old man&rsquo; to-night, and showing how he may be put off. Now
do you from your pulpit teach your people how that may be
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I teach the vicarious atonement of the Christ, and prepare
my flock for the world to come,&rdquo; replied the minister with
some heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am interested in the eternal present,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;not in a suppositional future. And so was Jesus. The world
to come is right here. &lsquo;I am that which is, and which was,
and which is to come,&rsquo; says the infinite, ever-present mind,
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no Christianity whatsoever in your speculative philosophy,&rdquo;
retorted the minister. &ldquo;If what you say is true, and
the world should accept it, all that we have learned in the ages
past would be blotted out, and falsehood would be written
across philosophy, science, and religion. By wafting evil
lightly aside as unreal, you dodge the issue, and extend license
to all mankind to indulge it freely. Evil is an awful, a stupendous
fact! And it can not be relegated to the realm of
shadow, as you are trying to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jesus regard it as a reality?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You know,
Duns Scotus said: &lsquo;Since there is no real being outside of
God, evil has no substantial existence. Perfection and reality
are synonyms, hence absolute imperfection is synonymous with
absolute unreality.&rsquo; Did Jesus know less than this man? And
do you really think he looked upon evil as a <i>reality</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He most certainly did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if that is true,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I will have to reject
him. But come, we are right up to the point of discussing
him and his teachings, and that will be the subject of our next
meeting. Will you join us, Mr. Moore? It is love, you know,
that has drawn us all together. You&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an open forum, Moore,&rdquo; said the doctor, patting him
on the back. &ldquo;Wisdom isn&rsquo;t going to die with you. Come
and get a new viewpoint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite well satisfied with my present one, Doctor,&rdquo;
replied the minister tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, come and correct us when we err. It&rsquo;s your
duty to save us if we&rsquo;re in danger, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;And now, Carmen, the piano
awaits you. By the way, what did Maitre Rossanni tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the girl lightly, &ldquo;he begged me to let him
train me for Grand Opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said I would make a huge fortune,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you would! Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_85' name='book4_page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I carried my wealth with me, always, and that
my fortune was now so immense that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly hope
to add to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you refused the chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; she said, going to him and looking up
into his face, &ldquo;I am too busy for Grand Opera and money-making.
My voice belongs to the world. I couldn&rsquo;t be happy
if I made people pay to hear me sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she turned and seated herself at the piano, where
she launched into a song that made the very Reverend Patterson
Moore raise his glasses and stare at her long and curiously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>
</div>
<p>Man reasons and seeks human counsel; but woman obeys
her instincts. Carmen did this and more. Her life had
been one of utter freedom from dependence upon human
judgment. The burden of decision as to the wisdom of a
course of action rested always upon her own thought. Never
did she seek to make a fellow-being her conscience. When
the day of judgment came, the hour of trial or vital demand,
it found her standing boldly, because her love was made perfect,
not through instinct alone, but through conformity with
the certain knowledge that he who lacks wisdom may find it
in the right thought of God and man. And so, when on the
next day she joined Hitt and Haynerd in the office of the Social
Era, and learned that Carlson had met their terms, eagerly,
and had transferred to them the moribund Express, she had no
qualms as to the wisdom of the step which they were taking.</p>
<p>But not so her companions. Haynerd was a composite
picture of doubt and fear, as he sat humped up in his chair.
Hitt was serious to the point of gloom, reflecting in a measure
his companion&rsquo;s dismal forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared to death for fear he wouldn&rsquo;t sell,&rdquo; Haynerd
was saying as the girl entered; &ldquo;and I was paralyzed whenever
I thought that he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed aloud when she heard these words. &ldquo;Do
you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you remind me of Lot&rsquo;s wife. She was
told to go ahead, along the right course. But she looked back&ndash;&ndash;alas
for her! Now you two being started right are looking
back; and you are about to turn to salt tears!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen,&rdquo; she continued, as Haynerd began to remonstrate;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t voice a single fear to me! You couldn&rsquo;t make
me believe them true even if you argued for weeks&ndash;&ndash;and we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_86' name='book4_page_86'></a>86</span>
have no time for such foolishness now. The first thing that
you have got to do, Ned, is to start a little cemetery. In it
you must bury your fears, right away, and without any mourning.
Put up little headstones, if you wish; but don&rsquo;t ever go
near the place afterward, excepting to plant the insults, and
gibes, and denouncements, and vilifications which the human
mind will hurl at you, once the Express starts out on its new
career. Good is bound to stir up evil; and the Express is now
in the business of good. Remember, the first thing the Apostles
always did was to be afraid. And they kept Jesus busy pointing
out the nothingness of their fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business of good!&rdquo; retorted Haynerd savagely. &ldquo;I guess
we&rsquo;ll find ourselves a bit lonely in it, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, humanly speaking,&rdquo; replied the girl, taking a chair
beside him. &ldquo;But, Ned, let me tell you of the most startling
thing I have found in this great, new country. It is this: you
Americans have, oh, so much animal courage&ndash;&ndash;and so little
true moral courage! You know that the press is one of the
most corrupt institutions in America, don&rsquo;t you? The truth
is not in it. Going into thousands of homes every day, it is a
deadlier menace than yellow fever. You know that it is muzzled
by so-called religious bodies, by liquor interests, by vice-politicians,
by commercialism, and its own craven cowardice.
And yet, Ned, despite your heart-longing, you dare not face the
world and stand boldly for righteousness in the conduct of the
Express!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly, &ldquo;let me tell you more. While
you have been debating with your fears as you awaited Mr.
Carlson&rsquo;s decision, I have been busy. If I had allowed my
mentality to become filled with fear and worry, as you have
done, I would have had no room for real, constructive thought.
But I first thanked God for this grand opportunity to witness
to Him; and then I put out every mental suggestion of failure,
of malicious enmity from the world, and from those who think
they do not love us, and with it every subtle argument about
the unpreparedness of the human mind for good. After that
I set out to visit various newspaper offices in the city. I have
talked with four managing and city editors since yesterday
noon. I have their viewpoints now, and know what motives
animate them. I know what they think. I know, in part,
what the Express will have to meet&ndash;&ndash;and how to meet it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men stared at her in blank amazement. Haynerd&rsquo;s
jaw dropped as he gazed. He had had a long apprenticeship
in the newspaper field, but never would he have dared attempt
what this fearless girl had just done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found out what news is,&rdquo; Carmen resumed. &ldquo;It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_87' name='book4_page_87'></a>87</span>
wholly <i>a human invention</i>! It is the published vagaries of the
carnal mind. In the yellow journal it is the red-inked, screaming
report of the tragedies of sin. I asked Mr. Fallom if he
knew anything about mental laws, and the terrible results of
mental suggestion in his paper&rsquo;s almost hourly heralding of
murder, theft, and lust. But he only laughed and said that the
lurid reports of crime tended to keep people alive to what was
going on about them. He couldn&rsquo;t see that he was making a
terrible reality of every sort of evil, and holding it so constantly
before an ignorant, credulous world&rsquo;s eyes that little else could
be seen. The moral significance of his so-called news reports
had no meaning whatsoever for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go to see Adams?&rdquo; asked Haynerd, not believing
that she would have dared visit that journalistic demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the girl, to his utter astonishment. &ldquo;Mr.
Adams said he had no time for maudlin sentimentalism or
petticoat sophistry. He was in the business of collecting and
disseminating news, and he wanted that news to go <i>shrieking</i>
out of his office! Here is one of his afternoon extras. You
can see how the report of an Italian wife-murder shrieks in
red letters an inch high on the very first page. But has Mr.
Adams thereby seen and met his opportunity? Or has he
further prostituted journalism by this ignorant act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people want it, Carmen,&rdquo; said Hitt slowly, though his
voice seemed not to sound a real conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not!&rdquo; cried Carmen, her eyes snapping. &ldquo;If the
church and the press were not mortally and morally blind, they
would see the deadly destruction which they are accomplishing
by shrieking from pulpit and sanctum: &lsquo;Evil is real! Pietro
Lasanni cuts his wife&rsquo;s throat! Evil is real! Look, and be
convinced!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Carmen, while what you say is doubtless true, it must
be admitted that the average man, especially the day laborer,
reads his yellow journal avidly, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;And why? The average
man, as you call him, is a victim of <i>the most pernicious social
system ever devised by the human mind</i>! Swept along in the
mad rush of commercialism, or ground down beneath its ruthless
wheels, his jaded, jarred nerves and his tired mind cry
out for artificial stimulation, for something that will for a
moment divert his wearied thought from his hopeless situation.
The Church offers him little that is tangible this side of
the grave. But whiskey, drugs, and yellow journalism do.
Can&rsquo;t you see, Mr. Hitt&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you, Ned&ndash;&ndash;that the world&rsquo;s cry
for sensationalism is but a cry for something that will make it
forget its misery for a brief moment? The average man feels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_88' name='book4_page_88'></a>88</span>
the superficiality of the high speed of this century of mad
rush; he longs as never before for a foundation of truth upon
which to rest; he is tired of theological fairy-tales; he is desperately
tired of sin, and sickness, and dying. He cares little
about a promised life beyond the grave. He wants help here
and now to solve his problems. What does the press offer him?
Little beyond a recount of his own daily miseries, and reports
of graft and greed, and accounts of vulgar displays of material
wealth that he has not and can not have. And these reports
divert his jaded mind for a moment and give him a false, fleeting
sense of pleasure&ndash;&ndash;and then leave him sunk deeper than
before in despair, and in hatred of existing conditions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is right,&rdquo; said Hitt, turning to Haynerd. &ldquo;And
we knew it, of course. But we have let our confidence slip.
This steam-calliope age reflects the human-mind struggle for
something other than its own unsatisfying ideas. It turns to
thrills; it expresses its restlessness and dissatisfaction with
itself by futurist and cubist art, so-called; by the rattle and
vibration of machinery; by flaring billboards that insult every
sense of the artistic; and by the murk and muck of yellow
journalism, with its hideous colored supplements and spine-thrilling
tales. So much for the reader. But the publisher
himself&ndash;&ndash;well, he battens materially, of course, upon the tired
victims of our degrading social system. He sees but the sordid
revenue in dollars and cents. Beyond that his morals do not
extend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Haynerd. &ldquo;Decent journalism
wouldn&rsquo;t pay&ndash;&ndash;doesn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;never did! Other papers have tried it,
and miserably failed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; returned Hitt calmly, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
&ldquo;oil will meet the deficit. As long as my paternal wells flow
in Ohio the Express will issue forth as a clean paper, a dignified,
law-supporting purveyor to a taste for better things&ndash;&ndash;even
if it has to create that taste. Its columns will be closed to
salacious sensation, and its advertising pages will be barred
to vice, liquor, tobacco, and drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Carmen. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ve got to get right
down to business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Hitt, rising. &ldquo;It is my intention to issue the
Express one more week on its present basis, and then turn it
into a penny morning daily. I have seen and talked with its
staff. They&rsquo;re good men. I&rsquo;m going to assume the management
myself, with you, Carmen, as my first assistant. Haynerd
will become city editor. Now, what suggestions have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lots!&rdquo; cried the girl enthusiastically. &ldquo;But, first, how
far may I go?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_89' name='book4_page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The limit,&rdquo; replied Hitt, rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;You
are my brain, so to speak, henceforth. As to financial resources,
I am prepared to dump a hundred thousand dollars
right into the Express before a cent of revenue comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another question, then: will you issue a Sunday edition?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a while, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how it works, for
I have some ideas to try out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; resumed the girl eagerly, &ldquo;I want this paper
to be for <i>all</i> the people; to be independent in the truest sense
of the term; and to be absolutely beyond the influence of political
and religious sectarianism&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll soon enough learn
what that will cost you&ndash;&ndash;to be an active, constructive force in
this great city, and a patient, tireless, loving educator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Haynerd, although he was listening
very carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express will succeed,&rdquo; the girl went on, without noticing
him, &ldquo;because our thought regarding it is successful. <i>We</i>
have already succeeded; and that success will be externalized
in our work. It makes no difference what the people may think
of <i>us</i>; but it makes a lot of difference what <i>we</i> think of <i>them</i>
and <i>ourselves</i>. Now, our program is unlimited. We assume
superiority over adverse conditions, and we claim success, because
we know that these things are mental, and that they are
divinely ours. Lot&rsquo;s wife didn&rsquo;t have the sort of confidence
that wins&ndash;&ndash;she looked back. Our bridges are burnt behind us
now. But there is no doubt of the outcome. And so there is
no doubt lurking in us to take the edge off our efforts, is there?
The thought regarding the Express has not been timidly born
within us; it has come forth flashing vigor! Yes it has, Ned,
despite your doubts! And we have within us a power mightier
than any force outside of us. That is the knowledge of infinite
mind&rsquo;s omnipotence, and our ability to use the Christ-principle
to meet <i>every</i> problem. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd began to rouse up with a returning sense of confidence.
Hitt smiled and nodded to Carmen. The girl went on
rapidly and eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to give the people news from a new standpoint,
aren&rsquo;t we? We are not going on the assumption that
the report of mankind&rsquo;s errors is the report of real news. The
only thing that is really new is <i>good</i>. We&rsquo;ll report that. When
I was in Mr. Adams&rsquo;s office two items came in over the &rsquo;phone.
One was the report of a jewel robbery, and the other was an
announcement of the draining by the Government of submerged
lands in Louisiana, so as to give an additional opportunity
to those seeking farms. Which item did Mr. Adams put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_90' name='book4_page_90'></a>90</span>
in bold type on the front page? The first, yes. I was unable to
locate the latter anywhere in the paper, although it was a
timely bit of news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; replied Hitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now another thing,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;I want the Sunday
edition of the Express to contain a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the important
and vital news of the week, with the very clearest, most impartial
and enlightening editorial comment upon it. This calls
for nice discrimination in the selection of those items for our
comment. It means, however, the best practical education for
the people. This was John Ruskin&rsquo;s idea, and certainly is a
splendid one. Still another thing, the Express will stand
shoulder to shoulder with the women for equal suffrage. Are
you agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most emphatically!&rdquo; declared Hitt. &ldquo;It is the women who
will clean up and regenerate this world, not the men. Reform
is now in the hands of the women. They have been held back
long enough. And India proves that backward women mean
a backward nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Carmen, &ldquo;make a distinct Women&rsquo;s
Department in the Express, and put Miss Wall on the staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Next?&rdquo; inquired Hitt, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A daily educational department for foreigners, our immigrants,
giving them every possible aid in suggestions regarding
their naturalization, the languages, hotels, boarding houses,
employment, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express is going to maintain a social service, and
night schools. It is going to establish vacation and permanent
homes for girls. It is going to provide for vocational training.
It is going to establish a lecture bureau&ndash;&ndash;for lectures on <i>good</i>.
It is going to build a model city for workingmen. Then it is
going to found a model city for everybody. It is going to establish
clubs and meeting places for workingmen, places where
they may meet, and play games, and read, and have social intercourse,
and practical instruction. It is going to establish
the same for young boys. It is going to take the lead for civic
betterment in this city, and for child-welfare, and for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Haynerd was sitting erect and staring in bewilderment
at the girl. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he sputtered.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you wandering somewhat beyond strict newspaper
limits? We are in the news business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t I told you,&rdquo; returned the girl promptly, &ldquo;that
the only thing new in this world is <i>good</i>? Our news is going
to be <i>good</i> news&ndash;&ndash;the collection and dissemination of <i>good</i> to
all mankind. People who read our paper will no longer feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_91' name='book4_page_91'></a>91</span>
that it is dangerous to be alive, but a glorious privilege. I am
simply laying out our program. And Mr. Hitt said I could go
the limit, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt had caught the girl&rsquo;s infectious enthusiasm, and his
face was beaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your unlimited thought,
Carmen, that we old dry-bones want! I understand you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And so does dear old
protesting Ned. Why, what is money? What is anything in
this life, compared with real service to our fellow-men? <i>The
Express is not in business to make money!</i> It is in the business
of collecting and scattering the news of good. Its dividends
will be the happiness and joy it gives to mankind. Will
it fail? It simply can&rsquo;t! For <i>good is the greatest success
there is</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is likely that Hitt did not catch the full meaning of the
girl&rsquo;s words; and it is certain that Haynerd did not. But her
boundless enthusiasm did penetrate in large degree into their
souls, and they ceased to insist on the query, Will it pay? The
broader outlook was already beginning to return profits to
these men, as the newer definition of &lsquo;news&rsquo; occupied their
thought. Fear and doubt fled. Seizing their hats, they bade
Carmen go with them to inspect the plant of the Express, and
meet its staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;d like to ask,&rdquo; said Haynerd, as they
pursued their way toward their recent purchase. &ldquo;I want to
know what our editorial policy will be. Do we condone the
offenses of our grafters and spoilsmen by remaining silent regarding
their crimes? Or do we expose them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will let their guilt expose and kill itself,&rdquo; quickly returned
Carmen. &ldquo;How? Well, you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later they entered the gloomy, dust-laden
offices of the Express. Hitt&rsquo;s spirits sank again as he looked
about him. But Carmen seemed to suffer no loss of enthusiasm.
After a mental appraisal of the dingy, uninviting environment
she exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, one nice thing about this
is that we don&rsquo;t have much to start with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt reflected upon her cryptical remark, and then laughed.</p>
<p>Carlson joined them at this juncture. It was evident that
the sale of his plant had removed a heavy load from his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My best reporter was out yesterday when you called,&rdquo; he
said, addressing Hitt. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;well, he was a little the worse for
wear. But he&rsquo;s in now. Come into my office and I&rsquo;ll send
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes a tall, boyish fellow responded to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_92' name='book4_page_92'></a>92</span>
editor&rsquo;s summons. He must have been well under twenty,
thought Hitt, marveling that so young a man should be regarded
as Carlson&rsquo;s best news gatherer. But his wonder grew
apace when the editor introduced him as Mr. Sidney Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd. &ldquo;Know J. Wilton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad smiled pallidly, as he bent his gaze upon Carmen,
and addressed his reply to her. &ldquo;My governor,&rdquo; he said laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce he is!&rdquo; returned Haynerd, beginning to bristle.</p>
<p>Carlson dismissed the reporter, and turned to the curious
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy has the making of a fine newspaper man in him.
Has something of his father&rsquo;s terrible energy. But he&rsquo;s doomed.
Whiskey and morphine got him. He used to come down here
before his father threw him out. I let him write little articles
for the Express when he was barely sixteen years old; and
they were mighty good, too. But he got mixed up in some
scandal, and J. Wilton cut him off. The boy always did drink,
I guess. But since his family troubles he&rsquo;s been on the straight
road to the insane asylum. It&rsquo;s too bad. But you&rsquo;ll keep him,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; replied Haynerd aggressively. &ldquo;His father
is no friend of mine, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>shall</i> keep him,&rdquo; calmly interrupted Carmen. &ldquo;His
father is a <i>very</i> good friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlson looked from one to the other quizzically. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;
he mused. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; squinting over his glasses at the girl, &ldquo;this
surely is woman&rsquo;s era, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A week later the Express, scarcely recognizable in its clean,
fresh type and modest headlines, with its crisp news and well
written editorials, very unostentatiously made its entry into
the already crowded metropolitan field. Few noticed it. Adams
picked it up and laughed, a short, contemptuous laugh. Fallom
glanced over it and wondered. J. Wilton Ames, who had
been apprised of its advent, threw it into the waste basket&ndash;&ndash;and
then drew it out again. He re-read the editorial announcing
the policy of the paper. From that he began a careful
survey of the whole sheet. His eye caught an article on the
feminist movement, signed by Carmen Ariza. His lip curled,
but he read the article through, and finished with the mental
comment that it was well written. Then he summoned Willett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want this sheet carefully watched,&rdquo; he commanded,
tossing the paper to his secretary. &ldquo;If anything is noticed that
in any way refers to me or my interests, call my attention to it
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_93' name='book4_page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>The secretary bowed and departed. A moment afterward
Henry Claus, nominal head of the great Claus brewing interests,
was ushered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We licked &rsquo;em, Mr. Ames, we licked &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried the newcomer,
rushing forward and clasping the financier&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;The city council last night voted against the neighborhood
saloon license bill! Lined up solidly for us! Fine, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; commented the laconic Ames. &ldquo;Our aldermen are a
very intelligent lot of statesmen, Claus. They&rsquo;re wise enough
to see that their jobs depend upon whiskey. It requires very
astute statesmanship, Claus, to see that. But some of our
congressmen and senators have learned the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brewer pondered this delphic utterance and scratched
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Ames, &ldquo;have you your report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Yes, sure, Mr. Ames. Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames studied the document. Then he looked severely at
Claus. &ldquo;Sales less than last month,&rdquo; he remarked dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the local option law what done it, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; replied
the brewer apologetically. &ldquo;Them women&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Let a few petticoats whip you, eh? But, anyway,
you don&rsquo;t know how to market your stuff. Look here, Claus,
you&rsquo;ve got to encourage the young people more. We&rsquo;ve got
to get the girls and boys. If we get the girls, we&rsquo;ll get the boys
easily enough. It&rsquo;s the same in the liquor business as in certain
others, Claus, you&rsquo;ve got to land them young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames, I can&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em and pour it down their
throats!&rdquo; expostulated the brewer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could if you knew how,&rdquo; returned Ames. &ldquo;Why, man!
if I had nothing else to do I&rsquo;d just like to devote myself to the
sales end of the brewing business. I&rsquo;d use mental suggestion
in such a way through advertising that this country would
drown in beer! Beer is just plain beer to you dull-wits. But
suppose we convinced people that it was a food, eh? Advertise
a chemical analysis of it, showing that it has greater nutriment
than beef. Catch the clerks and poor stenographers that
way. Don&rsquo;t call it beer; call it Maltdiet, or something like
that. Why, we couldn&rsquo;t begin to supply the demand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you advertise, Mr. Ames?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billboards in every field and along all railroads and highways;
boards in every vacant lot in every town and city in the
country; electric signs everywhere; handbills; lectures&ndash;&ndash;never
thought of that, did you? And samples&ndash;&ndash;why, I&rsquo;d put samples
into every house in the Union! I&rsquo;d give away a million barrels
of beer&ndash;&ndash;and sell a hundred million as a result! But I&rsquo;d work
particularly with the young people. Work on them with literature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_94' name='book4_page_94'></a>94</span>
and suggestion; they&rsquo;re more receptive than adults. The
hypnotism that works through suggestive advertising, Claus,
is simply omnipotent! How about your newspaper contracts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have all the papers, excepting the Express, Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express?&rdquo; Ames laughed. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a new venture.
You can afford to pass it up. It&rsquo;s run by a college professor
and a doll-faced girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames, our advertising manager tells me that the
publishers of the Express called a meeting of the managers of
all the other city papers, to discuss cutting out liquor advertising,
and that since then the rates have gone up, way up!
You see, the example set by the Express may&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Ames. Then he began to reflect. An
example, backed by absolute fearlessness&ndash;&ndash;and he knew from
experience that the publishers of the Express were without
fear&ndash;&ndash;well, it could not be wholly ignored, even if the new
paper had no circulation worth the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; resumed the brewer, &ldquo;the Express is in every
newsstand in the city. All the boys are selling it. It&rsquo;s in every
hotel, in every saloon, in every store and business house here.
It&rsquo;s in the dives. It isn&rsquo;t sold, it&rsquo;s given away! Where do they
get their money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames himself wondered. And he determined to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me, Claus,&rdquo; he said at length, dismissing the
brewer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for you in a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was well after midnight when the little group assembled
in the dining room of the Beaubien cottage to resume their
interrupted discussions. Hitt and Haynerd were the last to
arrive. They found Doctor Morton eagerly awaiting them.
With him had come, not without some reluctance, his prickly
disputant, Reverend Patterson Moore, and another friend and
colleague, Doctor Siler, whose interest in these unique gatherings
had been aroused by Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to give him a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of our previous deductions,&rdquo;
the latter explained, as Hitt prepared to open the discussion.
&ldquo;And he says he has conscientious scruples&ndash;&ndash;if you know
what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Philistine, that&rsquo;s all, eh?&rdquo; offered Haynerd.</p>
<p>Doctor Siler nodded genially. &ldquo;I am like my friend, Reverend
Edward Hull, who says&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; interrupted Morton. &ldquo;Your friend has a life job
molding the plastic minds of prospective preachers, and he
doesn&rsquo;t want to lose the sinecure. I don&rsquo;t blame him. Got a
wife and babies depending on him. He still preaches hell-fire
and the resurrection of the flesh, doesn&rsquo;t he? Well, in that case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_95' name='book4_page_95'></a>95</span>
we can dispense with his views, for we&rsquo;ve sent that sort of
doctrine to the ash heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverend Moore opened his mouth as if to protest; but Hitt
prevented him by taking the floor and plunging at once into
his subject. &ldquo;The hour is very late,&rdquo; he said in apology, &ldquo;and
we have much ground to cover. Who knows when we shall
meet again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen stole a hand beneath the table and grasped the
Beaubien&rsquo;s. Then all waited expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I sat in my office this morning,&rdquo; began Hitt meditatively,
&ldquo;I looked often and long through the window and out
over this great, roaring city. Everywhere I saw tremendous
activity, frantic hurry, and nerve-racking strife. In the distance
I marked the smoke curling upward from huge factories,
packing houses, and elevators. The incessant seething, the
rush and bustle, the noise, the heat, and dust, all spelled business,
an enormous volume of human business&ndash;&ndash;and yet, <i>not one
iota of it contributed even a mite to the spiritual nature and
needs of mankind</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pondered this long. And then I looked down, far down,
into the streets below. There I saw the same diversified activity.
And I saw, too, men and women, rich and comfortable,
riding along happily in their automobiles, with not a thought
beyond their physical well-being. But, I asked myself, should
they not ride thus, if they wish? And yet, the hour will soon
come when sickness, disaster, and death will knock at their
doors and sternly bid them come out. And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I have sought to impress upon you whenever
you advanced your philosophical theories, Doctor,&rdquo; said Reverend
Moore, turning to Morton. The doctor glowered back at
him without reply. Hitt smiled and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what should the man in the automobile do? Is there
anything he <i>can</i> do, after all? Yes, much, I think. Jesus told
such as he to seek first the kingdom of harmony&ndash;&ndash;a demonstrable
understanding of truth. The automobile riding would follow
after that, and with safety. Why, oh, why, will we go on
wasting our precious time acquiring additional physical sensations
in motor cars, amusement parks, travel, anywhere and
everywhere, instead of laboring first to acquire that real knowledge
which alone will set us free from the bitter woes of human
existence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus set us free, sir,&rdquo; interposed Reverend Moore sternly.
&ldquo;And his vicarious atonement opens the door of immortality to
all who believe on his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that freedom, Mr. Moore, you believe will be acquired
only after death. I dispute that belief strenuously. But let us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_96' name='book4_page_96'></a>96</span>
return to that later. At present we see mankind laboring for
that which even they themselves admit is not meat. They
waste their substance for what is not bread. And why? Because
of their false beliefs of God and man, externalized in a
viciously cruel social system; because of their dependence upon
the false supports of <i>materia medica</i>, orthodox theology, man-devised
creeds, and human opinions. Is it not demonstrably
so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, who hath believed our report? Who wants to?
Alas! men in our day think and read little that is serious; and
they reflect hardly at all upon the vital things of life. They
want to be let alone in their comfortable materialistic beliefs,
even though those beliefs rend them, rive them, rack and twist
them with vile, loathsome disease, and then sink them into
hideous, worm-infested graves! The human mind does not
want its undemonstrable beliefs challenged. It does not want
the light of unbiased investigation thrown upon the views
which it has accepted ready-made from doctor and theologian.
Again, why? Because, my friends, the human mind is inert,
despite its seemingly tremendous material activity. And its
inertia is the result of its own self-mesmerism, its own servile
submission to beliefs which, as Balfour has shown, have grown
up under every kind of influence except that of genuine evidence.
Chief of these are the prevalent religious beliefs, which
we are asked to receive as divinely inspired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Morton glanced at Reverend Moore and grinned. But
that gentleman sat stolid, with arms folded and a scowl upon
his sharp features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; continued Hitt, &ldquo;is that which binds us to the
real. Alas! what a farce mankind have made of it. And why?
Because, in its mad desire to make matter real and to extract
all pleasures from it, the human mind has tried to eliminate the
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been having a bad spell of materialism, that&rsquo;s
true,&rdquo; interposed Doctor Morton. &ldquo;But we are progressing, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hitt replied, &ldquo;perhaps so. Yet almost in our own
day France put God out of her institutions; set up and crowned
a prostitute as the goddess of reason; and trailed the Bible
through the streets of Paris, tied to the tail of an ass! What
followed? Spiritual destitution. And in this country we have
enthroned so-called physical science, and, as Comte predicted,
are about to conduct God to the frontier and bow Him out with
thanks for His provisional services. With what result? As our
droll philosopher, Hubbard, has said, &lsquo;Once man was a spirit,
now he is matter. Once he was a flame, now he is a candlestick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_97' name='book4_page_97'></a>97</span>
Once he was a son of God, now he is a chemical formula.
Once he was an angel, now he is plain mud.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed Reverend Moore, visibly nettled, &ldquo;that is
because of his falling away from the Church&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Hitt calmly, &ldquo;he fell away from the Church
because he could not stagnate longer with her and be happy.
Orthodox theology has largely become mere sentimentalism.
The average man has a horror of being considered a namby-pamby,
religiously weak, wishy-washy, so-called Christian. It
makes him ashamed of himself to stand up in a congregation
and sing &lsquo;My Jesus, I love Thee,&rsquo; and &lsquo;In mansions of glory and
endless delight.&rsquo; What does he know about Jesus? And he
is far more concerned about his little brick bungalow and next
month&rsquo;s rent than he is about celestial mansions. And I don&rsquo;t
blame him. No; he leaves religion to women, whom he regards
as the weaker sex. He turns to the ephemeral wisdom of
human science&ndash;&ndash;and, poor fool! remains no wiser than before.
And the women? Well, how often nowadays do you hear the
name of God on their lips? Is He discussed in society? Is He
ever the topic of conversation at receptions and balls? No;
that person was right who said that religion &lsquo;does not rise to
the height of successful gossip.&rsquo; It stands no show with the
latest cabaret dance, the slashed skirt, and the daringly salacious
drama as a theme of discourse. Oh, yes, we still maintain
our innumerable churches. And, though religion is the most
vital thing in the world to us, we hire a preacher to talk to us
once a week about it! Would we hire men to talk once a week
to us about business? Hardly! But religion is far, far less
important to human thought than business&ndash;&ndash;for the latter
means automobiles and increased opportunities for physical
sensation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; objected Doctor Siler, &ldquo;I am sure this is
not such a godless era as you would make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Hitt. &ldquo;We have many gods, chief of whom
is matter. The world&rsquo;s acknowledged god is not spirit, despite
the inescapable fact that the motive-power of the universe is
spiritual, and the only action is the expression of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we have in our previous discussions
made some startling deductions, and we came to the conclusion
that there is a First Cause, and that it is infinite mind.
But, having agreed upon that, are we now ready to admit the
logical corollary, namely, that there can be but <i>one</i> real mind?
For that follows from the premise that there is but one God
who is infinite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we do not have individual minds?&rdquo; queried Miss
Wall.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_98' name='book4_page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We have but the one mind, God,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There are
not minds many. The real man reflects God. Human men
reflect the communal mortal mind, which is the suppositional
opposite of the divine mind that is God. I repeat, the so-called
human mind knows not God. It never sees even His manifestations.
It sees only its own interpretations of Him and His
manifestations. And these it sees as mental concepts. For
all things are mental. Could anything be plainer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they might be,&rdquo; suggested Doctor Siler.</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you will not admit
that all things are mental&ndash;&ndash;including the entire universe&ndash;&ndash;you
certainly are forced to admit that your comprehension of things
is mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; returned the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will likewise have to admit that you are not concerned
with <i>things</i>, but with your comprehension of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, well&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, after all, you deal only with mental things&ndash;&ndash;and
everything is mental to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;whence the human mind? Did God create it?&rdquo; continued
Doctor Siler. &ldquo;Did He, Mr. Moore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible states clearly that He created <i>all</i> things,&rdquo; returned
that gentleman a little stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; resumed Hitt very earnestly, &ldquo;we are on the
eve of a tremendous enlightenment, I believe. And for that
we owe much to the so-called &lsquo;theory of suppositional opposites.&rsquo;
We have settled to our satisfaction that, although mankind believe
themselves to be dependent upon air, food, and water for
existence, nevertheless they are really dependent upon something
vastly finer, which is back of those things. That &lsquo;something&rsquo;
we call God, for it is good. Matthew Arnold said that the
only thing that can be verified about God is that He is &lsquo;the eternal
power that makes for righteousness.&rsquo; Very well, we are
almost willing to accept that alone&ndash;&ndash;for that carries infinite
implications. It makes God an eternal, spiritual power, omnipotent
as an influence for good. It makes Him the infinite patron,
so to speak, of right-thinking. And we know that thought is
creative. So it makes Him the sole creative force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;force, or power, is not material. God
by very necessity is mind, including all intelligence. And His
operations are conducted according to the spiritual law of
evolution. Oh, yes, evolution is not a theory, it is a fact. God,
infinite mind, evolves, uncovers, reveals, unfolds, His numberless
eternal ideas. These reflect and manifest Him. The
greatest of these is the one that includes all others and expresses
and reflects Him perfectly. That we call man. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_99' name='book4_page_99'></a>99</span>
is the man who was &lsquo;made&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;revealed, manifested&ndash;&ndash;in His
image and likeness. There is no other image and likeness of
God. Moreover, God has always existed, and always will. So
His ideas, including real man, have had no beginning. They
were not created, as we regard creation, but have been unfolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well and good, so far. But now we come to the peculiar
part, namely, the fact that <i>reality seems always to have its
shadow in unreality</i>. Every positive seems to have a negative.
The magnet has its opposite poles, one positive, the other negative.
Jesus had his Nero. Truth has its opposing falsities. At
the lowest ebb of the world&rsquo;s morals appeared the Christ. The
Christian religion springs from the soil of a Roman Emperor&rsquo;s
blood-soaked gardens. And so it goes. Harmony opposed by
discord. Errors hampering the solving of mathematical problems.
Spirit opposed by matter. Which is real? That which
stands the test of demonstration as to permanence, I say with
Spencer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we learn that it is the <i>communal mortal mind</i>
that stands as the opposite and negative of the infinite mind
that is God, and that it is but a supposition, without basis of
real principle or fact. It has its law of evolution, too, and
evolves its types in human beings and animals, in mountain,
tree, and stream. All material nature, in fact, is but the manifestation,
or reflection, of this communal mortal mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, though God had no beginning, and will have no ending,
this communal mortal mind, on the contrary, did have a
seeming beginning, and will end its pseudo-existence. It seemingly
began as a mental mist. It seemingly evolved form and
became active. It seemingly evolved its universe, and its earth
as its lower stratum. It made its firmament, and it gradually
filled its seas with moving things that manifested its idea of life.
Slowly, throughout inconceivable eons of time, it unrolled and
evolved, until at last, through untold generations of stupid,
sluggish, often revolting animal forms, it began to evolve a
type of mind, a crude representation of the mind that is God,
and manifesting its own concept of intelligence. That type
was primitive man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what was this communal mortal mind doing? Counterfeiting
divine mind, if I may so express it. Evolving crude
imitative types. But types that were without basis of principle,
and so they passed away&ndash;&ndash;the higher forms died, the lower
disintegrated. Aye, death came into the world because of sin,
for the definition of sin is the Aramaic word which Jesus used,
translated &lsquo;<i>hamartio</i>,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;missing the mark.&rsquo; The
mortal mind missed the mark. And so its types died. And so
they still die to-day. Yes, sin came through Adam, for Adam
is the name of the communal mortal mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_100' name='book4_page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ages and ages passed, reckoned in the human mind
concept of time. The evolution was continually toward a
higher and ever higher type. Why? The influence of divine
mind was penetrating it. Paleolithic man still died, because
he did not have enough real knowledge in his mortal mind to
keep him from missing the mark. He probably had no belief
in a future life, for he did not bury his dead after the manner
of those who later manifested this belief. But, after the lapse
of centuries, Neolithic man was found manifesting such a belief.
What has happened? This: the mortal mind was translating
the divine idea of immortality into its own terms and
thus expressing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ages rolled on. The curtain began to rise upon what we
call human history. The idea of a power not itself began to
filter through the mist of mortal mind, and human beings felt
its influence, the influence that makes for righteousness. And
then, at last, through the mortal mind there began to filter the
idea of the one God. The people who best reflected this idea
were the ancient Israelites. They called themselves the &lsquo;chosen&rsquo;
people. Their so-called minds were, as Carmen has expressed
it, like window-panes that were a little cleaner than
the others. They let a bit more of the light through. God is
light, you know, according to the Scriptures. And little by
little they began to record their thoughts regarding their concept
of the one God. These writings became sacred to them.
And soon they were seeing their God manifested everywhere,
and hearing His voice in every sound of Nature. And as they
saw, they wrote. And thus began that strange and mighty
book, the Bible, <i>the record of the evolution of the concept of
God in the human mind</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that the Bible was not given by inspiration?&rdquo;
demanded Reverend Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;This filtering process that I have been
speaking about <i>is</i> inspiration. Every bit of truth that comes to
you or me to-day comes by inspiration&ndash;&ndash;the breathing in&ndash;&ndash;of
the infinite mind that is truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we have those reflections of the
communal mortal mind which we call the Israelites recording
their thoughts and ideas. Sometimes they recorded plain fact;
sometimes they wrapped their moral teachings in allegories and
fables. Josephus says of Moses that he wrote some things
enigmatically, some allegorically, and the rest in plain words,
since in his account of the first chapter of Genesis and the
first three verses of the second he gives no hint of any mystery
at all. But when he comes to the fourth verse of the second
chapter he says Moses, after the seventh day was over, began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_101' name='book4_page_101'></a>101</span>
to talk philosophically, and so he understood the rest of the
second and third chapters in some enigmatical and allegorical
sense. Quite so, it appears to me, for the writer, whoever he
was, was then attempting the impossible task of explaining the
enigma of evil, the origin of which is associated always with
the dust-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deny the truth of the account of the creation as given
in the second chapter of Genesis, do you?&rdquo; asked Reverend
Moore. &ldquo;You deny that man was tempted and fell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Hitt, smiling, &ldquo;of course there is no special
reason for denying that serpents may have talked, millions and
millions of years ago. In fact, they still have rudimentary
organs of speech&ndash;&ndash;as do most animals. Perhaps they all talked
at one time. Snakes developed in the Silurian Era, some twenty
million years ago. In the vast intervening stretch of time
they may have lost their power to talk. But, as for the second
chapter of Genesis, Moses may or may not have written it. Indeed,
he may not have written the first. We do not know. The
book of Genesis shows plainly that it is a composite of several
books by various authors. I incline to the belief that some
more materialistic hand and mind than Moses&rsquo;s composed that
second chapter. However that may be, it is a splendid example
of the human mind&rsquo;s crude attempt to interpret the spiritual
creation in its own material terms. It in a way represents the
dawning upon the human mind of the idea of the spiritual
creation. For when finite sense approaches the infinite it must
inevitably run into difficulties with which it can not cope; it
must meet problems which it can not solve, owing to its lack
of a knowledge of the infinite principle involved. That&rsquo;s why
the world rejected the first account of the creation and accepted
the second, snake-story, dust-man, apple tree, and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitt!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd, his eyes wide agape. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
like a story-book! Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; interrupted Miss Wall. &ldquo;We know that man appeared
on this earth in comparatively recent times. For millions
and millions of years before he was evolved animals and
vegetables had been dying. Now was their death due to sin?
If so, whose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; returned Hitt. &ldquo;Your difficulty arises from
the fact that we are accustomed to associate sin with human
personality. But remember, the physical universe has been
evolved from the communal mortal mind. It represents &lsquo;negative
truth.&rsquo; It has been dying from the very beginning of its
seeming existence, for its seeming existence alone is sin. The
vegetables, the animals, and now the men, that have been
evolved from it, and that express it and reflect and manifest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_102' name='book4_page_102'></a>102</span>
it, must die, necessarily, because the so-called mind from which
they evolve is not based upon the eternal, immortal principle,
God. And so it and they miss the mark, and always have done
so. You must cease to say, Whose sin? Remember that the
sin is inherent in the so-called mind that is expressed by things
material. The absence of the principle which is God is sin, according
to the Aramaic word, translated &lsquo;<i>hamartio</i>,&rsquo; which
Jesus used. The most lowly cell that swam in the primeval
seas manifested the communal mortal mind&rsquo;s sin, and died as a
consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, it manifested a supposition, as opposed to
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its existence was quite suppositional,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;It
did not manifest life, but a material sense of existence. The
subjective always determines the objective. And so the communal
mortal mind, so-called, determined these first lowly material
and objective forms of existence. They were its phenomena,
and they manifested it. Different types now manifest
it, after long ages. But all are equally without basis of principle,
all are subject to the mortal law that everything material
contains within itself the elements for its own destruction, and
all must pass away. In our day we are dealing with the highest
type of mortal mind so far evolved, the human man. He, too,
knows but one life, human life, the mortal-mind sense of existence.
His human life is demonstrably only a series of states of
material consciousness, states of thought-activity. The classification
and placing of these states of consciousness give him
his sense of time. The positing of his mental concepts give
him his sense of space. His consciousness is a thought-activity,
externalizing human opinions, ideas, and beliefs, not based on
truth. This consciousness&ndash;&ndash;or supposititious human mind&ndash;&ndash;is
very finite in nature, and so is essentially self-centered. It
attributes its fleshly existence to material things. It believes
that its life depends upon its fleshly body; and so it thinks
itself in constant peril of losing it. It goes further, and believes
that there are multitudes of other human minds, each having
its own human, fleshly existence, or life, and each capable of
doing it and one another mortal injury. It believes that it can
be deprived by its neighboring mortal minds of all that it
needs for its sustenance, and that it can improve its own status
at their expense, and vice versa. It is filled with fears&ndash;&ndash;not
knowing that God is infinite good&ndash;&ndash;and its fears become externalized
as disaster, loss, calamity, disease, and death at
last. Perhaps its chief characteristic is mutability. It has no
basis of principle to rest upon, and so it constantly shifts and
changes to accord with its own shifting thought. There is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_103' name='book4_page_103'></a>103</span>
nothing certain about it. It is here to-day, and gone to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty dismal state of affairs!&rdquo; Haynerd was heard to
mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ned,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;there is this hope: human consciousness
always refers its states to something. And that
&lsquo;something&rsquo; is real. It is infinite mind, God, and its infinite
manifestation. The human mind still translates or interprets
God&rsquo;s greatest idea, Man, as &lsquo;a suffering, sinning, troubled
creature,&rsquo; forgetting that this creature is only a mental concept,
and that the human mind is looking only at its own thoughts,
and that these thoughts are counterfeits of God&rsquo;s real thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, though the human mind is finite, and can not
even begin to grasp the infinite, the divine mind has penetrated
the mist of error. There is a spark of real reflection in
every mortal. That spark can be made to grow into a flame
that will consume all error and leave the real man revealed, a
consciousness that knows no evil. There is now enough of a
spark of intelligence in the human, so-called mind to enable it
to lay hold on truth and grow out of itself. And there is no
excuse for not doing so, as Jesus said. If he had not come we
wouldn&rsquo;t have known that we were missing the mark so terribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Haynerd, &ldquo;after that classification I don&rsquo;t
see that we mortals have much to be puffed up about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All human beings, or mortals, Ned,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;are interpretations
by the mortal mind of infinite mind&rsquo;s idea of itself,
Man. These interpretations are made in the human mind, and
they remain posited there. They differ from one another only
in degree. All are false, and doomed to decay. How, then,
can one mortal look down with superciliousness upon another,
when all are in the same identical class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s thoughts rested for a moment upon the meaningless
existence of Mrs. Hawley-Crowles, who had anchored her
life in the shifting sands of the flesh and its ephemeral joys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed Hitt, &ldquo;we will come back to the question of
progress. What is progress but the growing of the human
mind out of itself under the influence of the divine stimulus of
demonstrable truth? And that is made possible when we
grasp the stupendous fact that the human, mortal mind, including
its man, is absolutely unreal and non-existent! The
human man changes rapidly in mind, and, consequently, in its
lower stratum, or expression, the body. For that reason he need
not carry over into to-day the old, false beliefs which were
manifested by him yesterday. If he leaves them in the past,
they cease to be manifested in his present or future. Thus he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_104' name='book4_page_104'></a>104</span>
outgrows himself. Then, opening himself to truth, he lays off
the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; and puts on the &lsquo;new.&rsquo; He denies himself&ndash;&ndash;denies
that there is any truth in the seeming reality of the mortal,
material self&ndash;&ndash;as Jesus bade us do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must make new thoughts, then?&rdquo; said Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;Thought is not manufactured. God is
eternal mind. His ideas and the thoughts regarding them must
always have existed. His thoughts are infinite in number. He,
as mind, is an inexhaustible reservoir of thought. Now the
human, mortal mind interprets His thoughts, and so <i>seems</i> to
manufacture new thought. It makes new interpretations, but
not new thoughts. When you hear people chatting, do you
think they are manufacturing new thought? Not a bit of it!
They are but reflecting, or voicing, the communal so-called
mortal mind&rsquo;s interpretations of God&rsquo;s innumerable and real
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; suggested Father Waite, &ldquo;the more nearly correct
our interpretations of His thoughts are, the nearer we
approach to righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; returned Hitt. &ldquo;There exist all sorts of real
thoughts about God&rsquo;s ideas. And these are good and eternal.
But the human mind makes likewise all sorts of erroneous
translations of them. We shall solve our problem of existence
when we correctly interpret His thoughts, and use them only.
When the human mentality becomes attuned or accustomed to
certain thoughts, that kind flow into it readily from the communal
mortal mind. Some people think for years along certain
erroneous or criminal lines. Their minds are set in that
direction, and invite such a flow of thought. But were they to
reverse the &lsquo;set,&rsquo; there would be a very different and better resulting
externalization in health, prosperity, and morals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see,&rdquo; said Miss Wall. &ldquo;And I begin to glimpse the
true mission of Jesus, and why he was ready to give up everything
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And now a word further about the so-called mortal
mind. For, when we have collected and arranged all our
data regarding it, we will find ourselves in a position to begin
to work out of it, and thereby truly work out our salvation, even
if with fear and trembling. I have said in a previous talk that,
judging by the deductions of the physical scientists, everything
seems about to leave the material basis and turn into vibrations,
and &lsquo;man changes with velocity&rsquo; of these. They tell us that all
life depends upon water; that life began, eons ago, in the
primeval sea. True, the human sense of existence, as I have
said, began in the dark, primeval sea of mist, the deep and
fluid mortal mind, so-called. And that sense of existence most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_105' name='book4_page_105'></a>105</span>
certainly is dependent upon the fluid of mortal mind. Bich&acirc;t
has said that &lsquo;life is the sum of the forces that resist death.&rsquo;
Spencer has defined life as the &lsquo;continuous adjustment of internal
to external relations.&rsquo; Very good, as applied to the
human sense of life. The human mind makes multitudes of
mental concepts, and then struggles incessantly to adjust
itself to them, and at length gives up the struggle, hopelessly
beaten. Scientists tell us that life is due to a continuous series
of bodily ferments. The body is in a constant state of ferment,
and that gives rise to life. Good! We know that the human
mind is in a state of incessant ferment. The human mind is a
self-centered mass of writhing, seething, fermenting material
thought. And that fermentation is outwardly manifested in
its concept of body, and its material environment. The scientists
themselves are rapidly pushing matter back into the realm
of the human mind. Bodily states are becoming recognized as
manifestations of mental states&ndash;&ndash;not vice versa, as has been
ignorantly believed for ages. A prominent physician told me
the other day that many a condition of nervous prostration
now could be directly traced to selfishness. We know that
hatred and anger produce fatal poisons. The rattlesnake is a
splendid example of that. I am told that its poison and the
white of an egg are formed of <i>exactly the same amounts of the
same elements</i>. The difference in effect is the thought lying
back of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Doctor Siler. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pretend that
the snake thinks and hates&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Hitt, &ldquo;for thousands upon thousands of years
the human race has been directing hatred and fear-thoughts
toward the snake. Is it any wonder that the snake is now
poisonous? That it now reflects back that poisonous thought
to mankind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some are not poisonous, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we say how long they have not been so, or how soon
our hatred will make them all poisonous? Do you know,
moreover, that sorrow, remorse, all emotions, in fact, affect
the perspiration that exudes from the human body? Do you
know that hatred will render human perspiration the deadliest
poison known to science? I am told that in a few minutes of
murderous hatred enough of this poisonous perspiration is
exuded from the human body to kill a man. And do you know
that the thought which manifests upon the body in such deadly
poison is just as deadly when sent into the mentality of a
human being? Think what the Church&rsquo;s deadly hatred of so-called
heretics has done in the last nineteen hundred years!
Why, millions have been killed by it alone! And in the name
of Christ!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_106' name='book4_page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he said, consulting his watch, &ldquo;I must go. Even
a newspaper man requires a little sleep. And I must make my
apology for occupying the floor to-night to the exclusion of you
all. I have gradually been filling up with these thoughts for
some weeks, and I had to let them out. Besides&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; interrupted Father Waite, &ldquo;I shall soon be ready
to report on those questions of Bible research which you assigned
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; replied Hitt. &ldquo;Well, have you found that Jesus
really was an historical character, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;that he has found that it really
matters little whether there ever was such a person as the
human man Jesus. The Christ has always lived; and the
Christ-principle which the man Jesus is reported to have revealed
to the world is with us, here, now, and always. It is
the principle, rather than the man Jesus, that concerns us, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; interposed Reverend Moore, &ldquo;Jesus was the
incarnate Son of God, and your remarks concerning him are&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up, Pat!&rdquo; interrupted Doctor Morton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight that
out with you on the way home. Come, the meeting&rsquo;s adjourned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take up that question in our next discussion,&rdquo; said
Hitt. &ldquo;But, wait; Carmen must give us just a short song before
we part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl went immediately to the piano. As she passed
Hitt, she squeezed his hand. A few minutes later the little
group dispersed, with the melody of the girl&rsquo;s voice trembling
in their souls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>
</div>
<p>For several days Ames reflected, and waited. Judging by
the data which he was able to secure, the Express was
eating up money at a fearful pace. To continue at that
rate meant certain financial disaster in the near future. And
yet the publishers of the rejuvenated sheet seemed never to
count the cost of their experiment. Already they had begun
the introduction of innovations that were startling and even
mirth-provoking to staid, conservative publishers in the journalistic
field. To survive the long period necessary for the
education of the public taste to such things as the Express
stood for demanded a source of income no less permanent than
La Libertad itself. But at this thought Ames chuckled aloud.</p>
<p>Then an idea occurred to him. The Beaubien, of course, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_107' name='book4_page_107'></a>107</span>
her crippled financial condition was affording the Express no
monetary assistance. Carmen had nothing. Haynerd&rsquo;s few
thousands were long since dissipated. Hitt&rsquo;s income was measured.
But&ndash;&ndash;ah, Miss Wall! And her estate was handled by
Ames and Company! And handled, we may add, in such a
manner that Miss Wall knew naught regarding it, except that
she might draw upon it as one dips water from a hillside
spring.</p>
<p>Thus Ames reflected. And as he meditated upon the new
paper and its promoters, there gradually formed within him a
consuming desire to see again the fair young girl who had
drawn him so strongly, despite his mountainous wrath and
his flaming desire to crush her when she boldly faced him in
his own house on the night of his grand reception. Why had he
let her escape him then? He had been a fool! True, women
had meant little to him, at least in the last few years. But
this girl had seemed to stir within him new emotions, or those
long slumbering. He knew not, coarsely materialistic as was
his current thought, that in him, as in all who came within the
radius of her pure affection, she had swept chords whose music
he had never heard before.</p>
<p>Days passed, while Ames still mused. And then one morning
he took down the receiver and called up the office of the
Express.</p>
<p>No, Mr. Hitt was not there&ndash;&ndash;but this was his assistant.
And:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want to see Mr. Hitt, did you? You wanted to
see me. Well, you may come over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames nearly dropped the receiver in his astonishment. In
the first place, the girl had read his thought; and in the second,
he was not accustomed to being told that he might go to see
people&ndash;&ndash;they came cringing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come at twelve-fifteen,&rdquo; continued the clear, firm
voice. &ldquo;And remain a half hour; I&rsquo;m very busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames put down the instrument and looked about, thankful
that no one was there to comment on his embarrassment. Then
he leaned back in his chair and went slowly over in thought
the experiences of that eventful night in his house. Why, this
slip of a girl&ndash;&ndash;a half-breed Indian at best&ndash;&ndash;this mere baby&ndash;&ndash;!
But he glanced up at the great electric wall clock, and wished
it were then twelve-fifteen.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick,
strolled casually into the office of the Express. His air was one
of supreme confidence in his own powers. He was superhuman,
and he knew it. And the knowledge rendered him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_108' name='book4_page_108'></a>108</span>
unafraid of God, man, or beast. He had met and conquered
everything mundane, excepting this young girl. But that
thought was now delightful to him. In her he had unearthed
a real novelty, a ceaseless interest. She reminded him of a
beautiful kitten. She scratched and nettled him; but she was
as nothing in his grasp.</p>
<p>The first thing that impressed him on entering the office
was the air of prosperity which hung over the place. The environment,
he mentally commented, was somewhat unusual for
a newspaper plant. Order, quiet, and cleanliness were dominant
notes in the prevailing harmony. He first walked back
into the pressroom to see if the same conditions prevailed there.
Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a halt before
a door bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Miss Ariza,&rdquo; on the glass.
Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.</p>
<p>The room was small, but light and airy. Its furnishings
were new, and its walls had been freshly tinted. A few pictures
of good quality hung about them. A handsome rug lay upon
the floor. At the desk, bending over a new typewriter, sat
Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Ames, hesitating in the doorway.</p>
<p>The girl glanced up quickly. &ldquo;Oh, come in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
was expecting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered and took the chair indicated. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind
if I finish this article, do you?&rdquo; she said, bending again to her
work. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to go to the compositors right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; replied Ames easily. &ldquo;When we
talk I want your undivided attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re sure to get it,&rdquo; she returned, laughing. And
Ames wondered just what she meant.</p>
<p>He sat back in his chair and watched her closely. How
wondrous fair she was! Yet, there was just a slight tint in her
skin, he thought. Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto
was not wholly unfounded, although the strain must have been
greatly mixed. How simply she was dressed. He remembered
her in her beautiful ball gown. He thought he preferred this.
How rapidly her fingers sped over the keys. And what fingers!
What a hand! He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.
Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once
told him&ndash;&ndash;that she always seemed to be a better woman in this
girl&rsquo;s presence. But&ndash;&ndash;what changes had come since then!
Could he go on persecuting the harassed woman? But he
wouldn&rsquo;t, if&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh
of relief. She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten
sheets to the boy who responded. Then, turning to Ames:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_109' name='book4_page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to apologize, haven&rsquo;t you? But you needn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;m not a bit offended. I couldn&rsquo;t be, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apologize! Well, he certainly had not had any such intention
when he came in. In fact, he knew not just why he was
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Congressman Wales didn&rsquo;t vote for the unaltered
schedule. And so everything&rsquo;s all right, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she went on
lightly.</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;No vote has been taken,&rdquo; he said,
a dull anger rising within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are mistaken,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;The bill was
voted out of committee an hour ago. That&rsquo;s what I was writing
up. Here&rsquo;s the wire, showing the alterations made. Mr. Wales
voted for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames read the message, and handed it back. Beyond the
clouding of his features he gave no indication of his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;that incident is closed&ndash;&ndash;for
all time, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not reply for some moments. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he commented, turning quite away
from that subject, and glancing about, &ldquo;that one with the high
ideals you profess should be doing newspaper work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the contrary,&rdquo; she quickly returned. &ldquo;There is nothing
so practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?&rdquo; he
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run a newspaper on a basis of <i>practical</i> Christianity,&rdquo; she
answered, her eyes dancing. &ldquo;Just as all business will have to
be conducted some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned back and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to the carnal mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.
But there was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily
returned the look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it paid yet?&rdquo; he asked in a bantering tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendidly!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, I&rsquo;ll wager you won&rsquo;t get a dollar back on your
investment for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dollar! No, nor perhaps a penny! We are not measuring
our profits in money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your investment&ndash;&ndash;let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; he mused, trying to draw
her out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put into this thing a couple of hundred
thousand, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because money is the
only measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.
Mr. Hitt has put more than that amount already into the Express.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_110' name='book4_page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well! well! Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.
Ames,&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;We talk only prosperity in this
office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosperity! In the face of overwhelming debts! That&rsquo;s
good!&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>She looked at him closely for a moment. &ldquo;Debts?&rdquo; she said
in a low voice. &ldquo;<i>You</i> speak of debts? You who owe your fellow-men
what you can never, never repay? Why, Mr. Ames,
there is no man in this whole wide world, I think, who is so
terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? My dear girl! Why, I don&rsquo;t owe a dollar to any man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; she queried, bending a little closer to him. &ldquo;You do
not owe Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from
her? You do not owe poor Mr. Gannette the money and freedom
of which you robbed him? You do not owe anything to
the thousands of miners and mill hands who have given, and
still give, their lives for you? You do not owe for the life which
you took from Mrs. Hawley-Crowles? You do not owe for the
souls which you have debauched in your black career? For
the human wreckage which lies strewn in your wake? You
do not owe Mr. Haynerd for the Social Era which you stole
from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke. And
when she had finished, and they sat looking squarely into each
other&rsquo;s eyes, the silence was like that which comes between the
sharp click of lightning and the crash of thunder which follows.
If it had been a man who thus addressed him, Ames
would have hurled him to the floor and trampled him. As it
was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting above
the horizon, and stood over the girl.</p>
<p>She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled. &ldquo;Sit
down,&rdquo; she quietly said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only begun. Don&rsquo;t threaten,
please,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good, for I am
not a bit afraid of you. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint smile began to play about Ames&rsquo;s mouth. Then he
twitched his shoulders slightly. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I got up,&rdquo; he said, with an
assumption of nonchalance, &ldquo;to&ndash;&ndash;to read that&ndash;&ndash;ah, that motto
over there on the wall.&rdquo; He went slowly to it and, stooping,
read aloud:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,<br />
Defend the truth, combat the wrong!<br />
You&rsquo;ll find no scepter like the pen<br />
To hold and sway the hearts of men.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;That was written by your Eugene Field,&rdquo; offered the girl.
&ldquo;Now read the one on the opposite side. It is your <i>Tekel Upharsin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_111' name='book4_page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Leave the vain, low strife<br />
That makes men mad&ndash;&ndash;the tug for wealth and power&ndash;&ndash;<br />
The passions and the cares that wither life,<br />
And waste its little hour.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued the girl, &ldquo;that is only a suggestion to
you of the real handwriting on the wall. I put it there purposely,
knowing that some day you would come in here and
read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she
were some uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers. Then
the significance of her words trickled through the portals of
his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if I am not persuaded
by the second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways
you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she replied steadily, &ldquo;that the world
is entering upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal
views and methods belong to a day that is past. This century
has no place for them; it wearies of the things you represent;
you are the epitome of that evil which must have its little hour
of night before the reality dawns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regarded her intently for some moments. &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo;
he asked, &ldquo;that the Express, under its new management,
is about to turn muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men
of wealth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not considering the Express now, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;It is I alone who am warning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which
you voiced a moment ago? And do you intend to make the
columns of your paper spicy with your comments on my character
and methods? I verily believe you are declaring war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she
said gently. &ldquo;The Express serves all people. It will not shield
you when you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone
your methods at any price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;War, eh? Very well,&rdquo; he replied with a bantering smile.
&ldquo;I came over here this noon to get the policy of your paper. I
accept your challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our challenge, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;is the challenge
which evil always finds in good. It is perpetual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I like a good enemy, and an honest
one. All right, marshal your forces. Who&rsquo;s your general,
Hitt or Haynerd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; she answered simply.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_112' name='book4_page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>For an instant the man was taken back. Then he recovered
himself, and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, bending close to her, &ldquo;I admire
you <i>very</i> much. You are a splendid little fighter. Now let&rsquo;s
see if we can&rsquo;t get together on terms of peace. The world
hasn&rsquo;t used you right, and I don&rsquo;t blame you for being at odds
with it. I&rsquo;ve wanted to talk with you about this for some time.
The pin-headed society hens got jealous and tried to kill you.
But, if you&rsquo;ll just say the word, I&rsquo;ll set you right up on the
very pinnacle of social prestige here. I&rsquo;ll take you by the hand
and lead you down through the whole crowd of &rsquo;em, and
knock &rsquo;em over right and left! I&rsquo;ll make you the leading woman
of the city; I&rsquo;ll back the Express; we&rsquo;ll make it the biggest
newspaper in the country; I&rsquo;ll make you and your friends rich
and powerful; I&rsquo;ll put you in the place that is rightfully yours,
eh? Will you let me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers
when he concluded. His eyes were looking eagerly into her
face, and a smile, winning, enticing, full of meaning, played
about his lips. His voice had dropped to a whisper.</p>
<p>Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
join you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it!&rdquo; he eagerly cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you obey me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;and what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor. Then come,
take up the cross, and follow&ndash;&ndash;my leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo;
he coarsely insinuated, &ldquo;that you think you now have
material for an illuminating essay on my conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;It is too dark to be illuminating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting,
but he retained his outward composure. &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it probably has not occurred to you that the world regards
the Express as utterly without excuse for existence. It
says, and truly, that a wishy-washy sheet such as it, with its
devitalized, strained, and bolted reports of the world&rsquo;s vivid
happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack of interest.
The experiment has been tried before, and has signally failed.
Money alone can keep your paper alive. But, say the word,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be
ours?&rdquo; she concluded for him.</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have no ideals. No man who
amasses millions by taking advantage of the world&rsquo;s inhuman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_113' name='book4_page_113'></a>113</span>
and pernicious social system can have ideals worthy of the
name. To apply your methods, your thought, to the Express
would result in sinking its moral tone into the dust. As for
your money&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commit suicide, then!&rdquo; cried the man, yielding to his rising
anger. &ldquo;Let the Express go down, carrying you and your
spineless associates with it! But, remember, you will be the
sole cause of its ruin, and theirs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door. &ldquo;Your half
hour is up, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she said, glancing at the little clock on
her desk; &ldquo;and I must return to my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling
upon the girl. He would have given his soul if he could have
clasped that slender form in his arms! A sudden impulse
assailed him, and bade him fall upon his knees before her, and
ask her forgiveness and guidance. She stood waiting&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
just for that, and always with that same smile into which no
one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang sharply. Carmen hastened to
answer the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Hitt. Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;the cotton schedule was reported
out quite changed&ndash;&ndash;yes, an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she looked up, she was alone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated
herself in that woman&rsquo;s lap and wound her arms about her
neck, &ldquo;I am afraid for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mother dearest,&rdquo; replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, &ldquo;that is a sheer waste of time. If you haven&rsquo;t anything
more to occupy you than fear, you&rsquo;d better come down to the
office, and I&rsquo;ll set you to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you have defied him&ndash;&ndash;as he says, declared war&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearest, not that. It is the carnal mind, using him as
a channel, that has declared war against good. But evil is
not power; nor has it been given power by God. My one
thought is this: Am I doing that which will result in the greatest
good to the greatest number? Am I loving my neighbor
as myself? Serving as I would be served? Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good. If my mental attitude is right,
then God&rsquo;s law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am
protected. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dearie, but&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s the telephone! Oh, I do hope
they don&rsquo;t want you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement
that Haynerd was in distress. &ldquo;Sidney Ames is&ndash;&ndash;not
there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was to report a meeting. Mr. Haynerd
wanted Lewis. Now don&rsquo;t worry, dearest; I&ndash;&ndash;I won&rsquo;t go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_114' name='book4_page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>The girl had taken her coat and hat. A moment later she
gave the Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night. In
half an hour she stood at Haynerd&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; moaned that perturbed individual.
&ldquo;Here I am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he&rsquo;s
drunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here. What&rsquo;s the assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated. &ldquo;Mass meeting,
over on the East Side. Here&rsquo;s the address,&rdquo; taking up a slip
of paper. &ldquo;Open meeting, I&rsquo;m told; but I suspect it&rsquo;s an
I. W. W. affair. Hello!&rdquo; he said, replying to a telephone call.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? The Ames mills at Avon closed down this
afternoon? What&rsquo;s reason? Oh, all right. Call me in an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what this meeting is about,&rdquo; he said significantly. &ldquo;Four thousand
hands suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills. Dead of
winter, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney Ames slouched into the editor&rsquo;s office and sank
heavily into a chair. Haynerd gave a despairing gesture.
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, in sudden desperation, &ldquo;that fellow&rsquo;s got
to be sobered up, now! Or else&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another call came, this time from the Beaubien. Father
Waite had just come in. Could he take the assignment? Haynerd
eagerly gave the address over the &rsquo;phone, and bade him
start at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb
over his shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose at once and went to the lad. &ldquo;Come, Sidney,&rdquo;
she said, taking his hand.</p>
<p>The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl
into her own little office.</p>
<p>Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door. Then
she went to the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair,
and sat down beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand, &ldquo;there is but one habit&ndash;&ndash;the
habit of righteousness. That is the habit that you are
going to wear now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled,
and the linotypes snapped. There were quick orders; men
came and went hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.
Haynerd toiled like a beaver; but his whole heart was in his
work. He had found his niche. Carmen&rsquo;s little room voiced
the sole discordant note that night. And as the girl sat there,
holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she thanked her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_115' name='book4_page_115'></a>115</span>
God that the lad&rsquo;s true individuality was His pure thought of
him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At dawn Sidney Ames awoke. A rosy-tinted glow lay over
the little room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an
ethereal presence. A gentle pressure from the hand that still
clasped his brought a return of his earthly sense, and he
roused up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen! You&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sidney.&rdquo; The gentle voice sounded to him like distant
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you brought me in here last night&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His
hands closed about the little one that lay in his grasp. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;haven&rsquo;t
sat here&ndash;&ndash;with me&ndash;&ndash;all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sidney, all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and
burst into a flood of bitter tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t real, Sidney,&rdquo; she whispered, twining an arm about
his neck. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and
misery. Carmen stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to
her, while tears of love and pity coursed down her own cheeks.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the boy started up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; he
cried, struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild
light.</p>
<p>He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and
stood with her back against it, facing him. &ldquo;Stop, Sidney!&rdquo;
she cried, holding her hands against him. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t drive you!
It is powerless! <i>God reigns here!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and
led him, trembling and shivering, back to his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I,&rdquo; she whispered,
bending over the shaking form.</p>
<p>The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his
hands. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he moaned; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m <i>gone!</i>&rdquo; His
voice died into a tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.</p>
<p>Carmen bit her lip. She had faced many trying situations
in her brief life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless
courage and knew its source, the insidious suggestion now
persisted that the eyes of her people were upon her, and that
by this would stand or fall their faith. Aye, the world was
watching her now, keen-eyed and critical. Would she give it
cause to say she could not prove her faith by her works?</p>
<p>And then came the divine message that bade her &ldquo;Know
that I am God!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;that bade her know that responsibility lay
not upon her shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_116' name='book4_page_116'></a>116</span>
now called to witness. To see, or permit the world to see, this
mountainous error, this heaped-up evil, as real and having
power, meant a denial of the Christ and utter defeat. It meant
a weary retracing of her own steps, and a long night of spiritual
darkness to those whose eyes had been upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side,
&ldquo;you are right, the old man <i>is</i> gone. And now we are going
to create &lsquo;new heavens and a new earth, and the former shall
not be remembered nor come into mind&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;as thought. Underneath
are the everlasting arms, and you have sunk down, down,
down, until at last you rest upon them, and you find that you
haven&rsquo;t sunk at all, and that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly get away
from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward
her. &ldquo;Listen, Sidney dear, I am standing with you&ndash;&ndash;and with
me is omnipotent God! His arm is not shortened, that it can
not save you from the pit of spiritual oblivion into which
human thought would seem to make you think you had fallen,
engulfed by the senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy raised his head and looked at her through his
bloodshot eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely;
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just because I <i>do</i> understand, Sidney, that I am able
to help you,&rdquo; she interrupted quickly. &ldquo;I understand it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t only whiskey&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; his head sank again&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;morphine!
And&ndash;&ndash;God! it&rsquo;s got me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got the false thought that seems to call itself &lsquo;you,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Well, let it have it! They belong together. Let
them go. We&rsquo;ll cling to them no longer, but shake them off
for good. For good, I said, Sidney&ndash;&ndash;and that means, for <i>God</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God?&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;I know no God! If there were a God,
I shouldn&rsquo;t be where I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will know it for you,&rdquo; she softly answered. &ldquo;And
you are now right where you belong, in Him. And His love
is about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; He laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Love! I never knew what
it meant. My parents didn&rsquo;t teach it to their children. And
when I tried to learn, my father kicked me into the street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Sidney, I&rsquo;ll teach you. For I am in the world just
to show what love will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s his fault&ndash;&ndash;all his fault!&rdquo; cried the boy,
flaring up and struggling to rise. &ldquo;God! I hate him&ndash;&ndash;hate him!
It&rsquo;s his fault that I&rsquo;m a sot and a drug fiend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden
brains, and shaking nerves. You don&rsquo;t hate your father; the
hate is against your thought of him; and that thought is all
wrong. We&rsquo;re going to correct it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_117' name='book4_page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I used to drink&ndash;&ndash;some, when I lived at home,&rdquo; the boy
went on, still dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained.
&ldquo;But he could have saved me. And then I fell in love&ndash;&ndash;I
thought it was love, but it wasn&rsquo;t. The woman was&ndash;&ndash;she was
years older than I. When she left the city, I followed her.
And when I found out what she was, and came back home, my
father threw me out&ndash;&ndash;cut me off&ndash;&ndash;God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Sidney,&rdquo; the girl whispered. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true
anyway.&rdquo; But she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts
that were tearing his very soul, and she suffered him, for it
uncovered to her the hidden sources of his awful malady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I drank, drank, drank!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;And I
lay in the gutters, and in brothels, and&ndash;&ndash;then, one day, Carlson
told me to come and work for him. He thought I could
straighten up. And so I went to a doctor, and he&ndash;&ndash;God curse
him!&ndash;&ndash;he injected morphine into my arm to sober me. And
that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and sober up
on morphine. But then I learned&ndash;&ndash;I found&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets. His eyes
became wilder as he searched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; he cried, turning fiercely upon the girl. &ldquo;Did
you take it from me? Give it to me&ndash;&ndash;<i>quick</i>!&rdquo; He caught her
wrist and twisted it painfully. His voice became a scream.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;God is everywhere!&rdquo;</i> flashed through the girl&rsquo;s thought.
&ldquo;I am not afraid to see evil seem to have power!&rdquo; Then aloud:
&ldquo;I know what you are searching for, Sidney. Yes, I have it.
Listen, and I will give it to you. You are searching for help.
No, it isn&rsquo;t in morphine tablets. It is in love&ndash;&ndash;right here&ndash;&ndash;the
Christ-principle, that is bigger far than the demons that seem
to tear you! I have <i>all</i> power from God, and you, evil, <i>can not
touch me</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.
Then he sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney!&rdquo; she cried, seizing his hand. &ldquo;Rise, and stand
with me! We don&rsquo;t have to struggle&ndash;&ndash;we don&rsquo;t have to fight&ndash;&ndash;we
only have to <i>know</i>. All that you are wrestling with is
the world-wide belief that there is a power apart from God!
<i>There is none!</i> Any claim that there is such a power is a lie!
I have proved it! You and I will prove it again! There is no
power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine! I have been
sent to help you! The Christ-principle will save you! There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a problem, that&rsquo;s all, Sidney,&rdquo; she went on, as he
became calmer. &ldquo;And I have the solution. Will you put yourself
in my charge, in my care, and let me meet it for you?&rdquo;
She bent over him and looked eagerly into his drawn face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_118' name='book4_page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to fight,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;We are not
going to resist evil as the world does, and so make it real. I
know, dear, just how pressing your need is. I know, and I
understand. I know how awfully real it seems to you. But
trust me, as I trust the Christ. For <i>victory is inevitable</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand. The
boy seemed to have been stunned. Then Carmen rose. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I am going to take you home with me. I am going
to keep you right with me, right under my thought. I&rsquo;m going
to be the mirror, constantly with you, that reflects infinite love
to you every moment. Come; your problem is mine now. The
burden of proof rests upon me. Don&rsquo;t think of anything else
now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending,
to the door. As she opened it, she looked up into his
face and smiled. The boy choked, and turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand. &ldquo;No; you
are mine now! And I shall not turn you over to yourself again
until the problem is solved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt met them as they came out of the room. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could.
But she&rsquo;s been worried. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back at three&ndash;&ndash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt
that Carmen would not be down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not leave the boy,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;She holds
him&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know how. And I know he is trying desperately
to help her. But&ndash;&ndash;I never saw any one stand as she does!
Lewis is here, but he doesn&rsquo;t interfere. We&rsquo;re going to put a
bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep there. Yes, I&rsquo;ll keep
you informed. Tell Ned, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface.
&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he said, in reply to Hitt&rsquo;s explanation. &ldquo;That
boy&rsquo;s life is more to her than a million newspapers, or anything
else in the universe just at present. She&rsquo;ll win! The devil
can&rsquo;t look her in the face! I&ndash;&ndash;I wish I were&ndash;&ndash;What are you
standing there for? Go &rsquo;long and get to work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry
waves of human fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and
utter misery mounted heaven-high, and fell again. Upon them
walked the Christ. As the night-shadows gathered, Sidney
Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a deep sleep. Then
Carmen left his bedside and went into the little parlor, where
sat the Beaubien and Father Waite.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_119' name='book4_page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial
of tablets to the latter. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t use them. And now,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;you must work with me, and stand&ndash;&ndash;firm! Sidney&rsquo;s
enemies are those of his own mental household. It is
our task to drive them out. We have got to uproot from his
consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a power.
Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in
a sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be
driven out, too. There is absolutely <i>no</i> human help! It is all
mental, every bit of it! You have got to know that, and stand
with me. We are going to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent
with respect to these seeming things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;you must not
watch this error so closely that it can&rsquo;t get away. Don&rsquo;t watch
it at all! For if you do, you make a reality of it&ndash;&ndash;and then,
well&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case is in your hands, Carmen,&rdquo; said Father Waite
gently. &ldquo;We know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly,
if he were here&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;the Christ <i>is</i> here!&rdquo; cried the girl, turning upon
him. &ldquo;Put away your &lsquo;ifs&rsquo; and &lsquo;buts.&rsquo; Stand, and <i>know</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bowed before the rebuke. &ldquo;And these,&rdquo; he said,
holding out the needle and vial, &ldquo;shall we have further use
for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be given us what we are to do and say,&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;The case rests now with God.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>
</div>
<p>Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the
bewildered, stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat
out upon the little porch of the cottage, drinking in the
glories of the winter sun. January was but half spent, and the
lad and girl were making the most of the sudden thaw before
the colder weather which had been predicted might be upon
them.</p>
<p>What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none
might have guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering
in streamlets of gold through her brown hair. But their meaning
to the boy might have been read with ease in the thin,
white face, turned so constantly toward his fair companion.
They were deeply, legibly written there, those black nights,
when he would dash out into the hall, determined to break
through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_120' name='book4_page_120'></a>120</span>
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his
mouth, his nostrils! Those ghastly nights, when Carmen
would stand before him, her arms outspread across the door,
and beat back the roaring devils within him! Those long
days of agonized desire for the vicious drug which had sapped
his manhood! Those fell hours, when low curses poured from
his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind! Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever! Those hours
when, with Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after
mile through drifts and ice, until he dropped at length from
sheer exhaustion, only to awake, hours later, to find that the
girl had brought him home, safe, unharmed!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And then, oh, the &ldquo;Peace, be still!&rdquo; which he began to hear,
faint at first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became
a mighty, thunderous command, before which the demons
paled and slunk away, never to return! Oh, the tears of agony
that had given way to tears of joy, of thanksgiving! Oh, the
weakness that had been his strength! And, oh, the devotion
of this fair girl&ndash;&ndash;aye, and of her associates, too&ndash;&ndash;but all through
her! Had she proved her God before the eyes of the world?
That she had! Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad&rsquo;s side, meeting
the arrows of death with her shield of truth! Night after night
she had sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate
grasp, flouting the terror that stalked before his delirious
gaze! What work she had done in those long weeks, none
would ever know; but the boy himself knew that he had
emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a new
mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.</p>
<p>As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their
thought was busy with the boy&rsquo;s future. Old plans, old ambitions,
had seemed to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse
which had rested upon him, and upward through the ashes
of the past a tender flower of hope was pushing its way. He
was now in a new world. The last tie which bound him to his
family had been severed by his own father two weeks before,
when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother&rsquo;s brilliant
path. Mrs. J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled
from abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly
social warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her
husband&rsquo;s consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition
which seized her on the night of the grand Ames
reception. For days she slowly faded, and then went quickly
down under a sharp, withering attack of pneumonia. A few
brief weeks after the formal opening of the Ames palace its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_121' name='book4_page_121'></a>121</span>
mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain desires,
her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had
gone to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal
thought. It was rumored by the servants that, in her last
hours, when she heard the rustle of the death angel&rsquo;s wings
beside her, a great terror had stricken her, and she had called
wildly for that son whom she had never cared to know. It was
whispered that she had begged of her husband to seek the lad
and lead him home; that she had pleaded with him to strive,
with the boy, to find the better things of life; that she had
begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings,
as she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in
heart, in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed
with the ashes of this life&rsquo;s mocking spoils. How true these
rumors, none might say. What truth lay hidden in her mad
ravings about the parentage of Carmen, and her confused, muttered
references to Monsignor Lafelle, no one knew. But of
those who stood about her bedside there was none who could
gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city&rsquo;s aristocracy had passed from this life
into the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.</p>
<p>The news of his mother&rsquo;s death had come at a time when
the boy was wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and
Hitt, and Carmen stood with him in his room and strove to
close their ears against the shrieking of the demon that was
tearing him. Hitt at once called up Willett, and asked for
instructions. A few minutes later came the message that the
Ames house was forever barred against the wayward son.
And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had
gently broken the news to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew her,&rdquo; the boy had said at length, rousing
from his meditations. &ldquo;Few of the rich people&rsquo;s children know
their parents. I was brought up by nurses and tutors. I never
knew what it was to put my arms around my mother, and kiss
her. I used to long to, at times. And often I would plan to
surprise her by suddenly running into her arms and embracing
her. But then, when I would see her, she was always so
far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed. And she seldom
spoke to me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up. And by
that time I was running wild. And then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking
his hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in our little private cemetery, you know.
The old error is dead, and we are not going to dig it up and
rehearse it, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled wanly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like a little baby,&rdquo; he said sadly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_122' name='book4_page_122'></a>122</span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just beginning to live. And you are my mother, the only
one I&rsquo;ve ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen laughed merrily. &ldquo;Let me be your sister,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We are so near of an age, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised her hand to his lips. &ldquo;You are my angel,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;My bright, beautiful angel. What would I have
been without you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sidney!&rdquo; she warned, holding up a finger. &ldquo;What
have I told you so often that Jesus said? &lsquo;Of mine own self
I can do nothing.&rsquo; Nor can I, Sidney dear. It was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her
voice sank to a whisper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it was the Christ-principle. It
worked through him as a channel; and it worked through me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to teach me all about that,&rdquo; he said, again
pressing her hand to his lips. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t cast me adrift yet,
will you, little sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast you adrift! Never, Sidney dear! Why, you&rsquo;re still
mine, you know! I haven&rsquo;t given you back to yourself yet,
have I? But now let&rsquo;s talk about your work. If you want to
write, you are going to, and you are going to write <i>right</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Carmen?&rdquo; he asked, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the Express,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t written
a word for it now for a month. And how dear, funny old Ned
has scolded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you dropped everything&ndash;&ndash;your work&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;for a
poor, worthless hulk like me,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t understand
it. You didn&rsquo;t know me, hardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney dear,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t for you. It was
for God. Everything I do is &lsquo;<i>as unto Him</i>.&rsquo; I would have done
the same for anybody, whether I knew the person or not. I
saw, not you, but the human need&ndash;&ndash;oh, such a need! And
the Christ-principle made me a human channel for meeting it,
that is all. Drop my work, and my own interests! Why, Sidney,
what is anything compared with meeting human needs?
Didn&rsquo;t Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick
and the suffering? Was money-making, or society, or personal
desire, or worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw
a need? You don&rsquo;t seem to understand that this is what I am
here for&ndash;&ndash;to show what love will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess I know only the world&rsquo;s
idea of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is love&rsquo;s counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;But now, back to
your work again. You&rsquo;re going to write, write, write! My,
but the world is hungry for <i>real</i> literature! Your yearning
to meet that need is a sign of your ability to do it. But, remember,
everything that comes to you comes from within.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_123' name='book4_page_123'></a>123</span>
You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is your mind; and
that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite and omnipresent.
Now you are going to mine that mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she went on hurriedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to be
afraid. We never fear a real thing; we fear only our false
thoughts of things. Always those thoughts are absolutely
wrong, and we wake up and find that we were fearing only
fear-thoughts themselves. Haven&rsquo;t you ever noticed it? Now
destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought, and God
will issue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; without waiting for his reply, &ldquo;now you have
reached that plane of thought where you don&rsquo;t really care for
what the world has to offer you. You have ceased to want to be
rich, or famous. You are not afraid to be obscure and poor.
You have learned, at least in part, that the real business of this
life lies in seeking good, in manifesting and expressing it in
every walk, and in reflecting it constantly to your fellow-men.
Having learned that, you are ready to live. Remember, there
is no luck, no such thing as chance. The cause of everything
that can possibly come to you lies within yourself. It is a function
of your thought. The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.
Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and
the basis upon which it rests! For, in your writing, you have
no right to inflict false thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we are told that in literature we must
deal with human realities, and with things as they are. The
human mind exists, and has to be dealt with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.
There are no human realities. The world still awaits
the one who will show it things as they <i>really</i> are. Human
realities, so-called, are the horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal
thought, without any basis of the divine Christ-principle.
I know, we are told that the great books of the world are those
which preserve and interpret its life. Alas! is it true greatness
to detail, over and over again in endless recital, the carnal
motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its awful
mesmerism, its final doom? Yes, perhaps, on one condition:
that, like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to
show their unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they
may be overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But most books&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited
human mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a
moment its troubles. They are literary narcotics; they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_124' name='book4_page_124'></a>124</span>
sops to jaded appetites, that&rsquo;s all. A book, for example, that
pictures an injured man discovering a great treasure, and
then using it to carry out his schemes of revenge&ndash;&ndash;well, what
influence for good has such a work? It is only a stimulus to
evil, Sidney. But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism
to real life and good&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such things don&rsquo;t happen in this world, Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they could, and should, Sidney dear. And they will,
some day. Then will come the new literature, the literature of
<i>good</i>! And it will make people think, rather than relieve them
from the ennui of solid thought, as our present novels do. The
intellectual palate then will find only insipidity in such books
as pour from our presses now. The ability to converse glibly
about authors who wallow in human unrealities will then no
longer be considered the hall-mark of culture. Culture in that
day will be conformity to truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad smiled at the enthusiastic girl. &ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you are a beautiful idealist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; came her quick reply, &ldquo;are you not a living illustration
of the practicability of my idealism, Sidney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes. Carmen stole an
arm about him. &ldquo;The most practical man who ever lived,
Sidney dear, was Jesus. And he was the greatest idealist. He
had ideas that differed very radically from other people&rsquo;s, but
he did not hide them for fear of giving offense. He was not
afraid to shock people with the truth about themselves. He
tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a foundation
of demonstrable truth. He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up. He did not bow abjectly
before the mandarins and pedagogues. Had he done
so, and given the people what they wanted and were accustomed
to, they would have made him a king&ndash;&ndash;and his mission
would have been a dead failure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for that they slew him,&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps
people from coming out and standing for what they know to
be right to-day. You are not one of those cravens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues
and muck-rakers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a
sorry mess, haven&rsquo;t they? They destroy without ruth, but
seldom, if ever, put forth a sane suggestion for the betterment
of conditions. They traffic in sensationalism, carping criticism,
and abuse. &lsquo;To find fault,&rsquo; said Demosthenes, &lsquo;is easy, and in
every man&rsquo;s power; but to point out the proper remedy is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_125' name='book4_page_125'></a>125</span>
proof of a wise counselor.&rsquo; The remedy which I point out,
Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that mankind
seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do. He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.
And why? Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty&ndash;&ndash;because
he voiced truth without fear&ndash;&ndash;because he made his
business the service of humanity. He took his work seriously,
not for money, not for human preferment, but for mankind.
And his work bears the stamp of eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> afraid, Sidney!&rdquo; the girl quickly interrupted.
&ldquo;Oh, why does the human mind always look for and expect
that which it does not want to see come or happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let me finish,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I was going to say that I&rsquo;m afraid if I write and speak only
of spiritual things I shall not be understood by the world, nor
even given a hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t use that word &lsquo;afraid.&rsquo; My! how the human
mind clings to everything, even words, that express its chief
bogy, fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I accept the rebuke. But, my question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the case with Jesus. And yet, has anything,
written or spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?
The present-day novel or work of fiction is as fleeting as the
human thought it attempts to crystallize. Of the millions of
books published, a handful endure. Those are they which
illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human thought. And
the greatest of such books is the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hunting for a subject now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hunt. Wait&ndash;&ndash;and <i>know</i>! The subject will then
choose you. It will pelt you. It will drive you to the task of
transcribing it. Just as one is now driving me. Sidney&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
I can give you the subject! Perhaps I am the channel
for this, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her inquisitively. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; bending over closer
to her, &ldquo;what is it, little sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft
snow. But her thought was not there. She saw a man, a
priest, she knew not where, but delving, plodding, digging for
the truth which the human mind has buried under centuries
and centuries of material <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. She saw him, patiently bearing
his man-made burden, striving to shield a tender, abandoned
girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly knowledge,
but without its dross. She saw the mighty sacrifice,
when the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_126' name='book4_page_126'></a>126</span>
the awful danger in which he dwelt. She understood
now. The years had taught her much. It was love&ndash;&ndash;aye, the
love that alone makes men great, the love that lays down human
life in self-immolating service.</p>
<p>She turned to the waiting lad. &ldquo;You will write it, Sidney?
I will tell you the whole beautiful story. It is an illustration
of the way love works through human channels. And perhaps&ndash;&ndash;perhaps,
some day, the book may reach him&ndash;&ndash;yes, some
day. And it will tell him&ndash;&ndash;oh, Sidney, it will tell him that I
know, and that I love him, love him, love him!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the office of the manager of the Express three heads
were close together that morning, and three faces bore outward
evidence of the serious thought within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Wall tells me, Ned,&rdquo; Hitt was saying, &ldquo;that her father
used to be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he
left his estate, badly entangled, for Ames to settle. Now it
transpires that Ames has been cunning enough to permit Miss
Wall to draw upon his bank almost without limit, he making
up any deficit with his own personal notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; commented Haynerd. &ldquo;I think I see the shadow of
his fine hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; resumed Hitt, &ldquo;she is given to understand that
Ames has been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his
personal notes as security for her deficits, and that the revenue
from her estate must be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the
Ames bank until such time as all obligations are met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; ejaculated Haynerd. &ldquo;In other words, Elizabeth
is simply cut off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien&rsquo;s
lawyer called on her to-day, and informed her that Hood had
gone into court and secured an injunction, tying up all revenue
from her estate until it can be unraveled. That cuts off her
income, likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd whistled. &ldquo;The hound!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Ames
is out to do up the Express, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of it, Ned,&rdquo; returned Hitt seriously.
&ldquo;And to utterly ruin all connected with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by God, we&rsquo;ll fight him to the last ditch!&rdquo; cried the
excited Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us,&rdquo;
nodding toward Miss Wall, &ldquo;and that you are seriously trying
to reform, for Carmen&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Haynerd meekly. &ldquo;I
really am trying to be decent, you know. But when I think of
Ames it&rsquo;s like a red rag to a bull!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_127' name='book4_page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>Miss Wall laughed. &ldquo;Never mind, Ned. I admire your
fighting spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Hitt continued, &ldquo;oil still flows from our paternal
wells. But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged
either to sell my oil holdings or mortgage them. They have
got to take care of us all now, including Madam Beaubien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Carmen?&rdquo; asked Haynerd suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, with Sidney. There&rsquo;s another anomaly: while Ames
is trying to ruin us, that girl is saving his son. Great world,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hell of a world!&rdquo; cried Haynerd. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your
pardon, Elizabeth. The fact is, either you or I will have to
retire from this meeting, for I&rsquo;m getting mad. I&ndash;&ndash;I may say
things yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say anything you want to, Ned. I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day. It helps to express my own feelings,&rdquo;
replied the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circulation of the Express,&rdquo; Hitt went on, &ldquo;is entirely
artificial. Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.
And still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into
practical form her big ideas. Limitation is a word that is not
in her vocabulary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitt, can&rsquo;t we fight Ames with his own fire? What about
that Wales affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ames is very cunning,&rdquo; answered Hitt. &ldquo;When he learned
that the cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and
Means Committee, he promptly closed down his Avon mills.
That was to scare Congress. Then he resumed, but on half
time. That was a plea of distress. I presume he will later
return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages. He&rsquo;s
trying to coerce Congress. Now how does he intend to do it?
This way: he will force a strike at Avon&ndash;&ndash;a February strike&ndash;&ndash;four
thousand hands out in the cold. Meantime, he&rsquo;ll influence
every other spinner in the country to do likewise. They&rsquo;ll all
follow his lead. Now, can Congress stand up against that sort
of argument? And, besides, he will grease the palms of a large
number of our dignified statesmen, you may be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; said Miss Wall, &ldquo;I suggest that you send Carmen
to Avon at once. I know of no one who can get to the bottom
of things as she can. Let her collect the facts regarding the
situation down there, and then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her first to Washington!&rdquo; interrupted Haynerd.
&ldquo;Have her hang around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while,
and meet a lot of those old sap-heads. What information
she won&rsquo;t succeed in worming out of them isn&rsquo;t in &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s
all!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_128' name='book4_page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Hitt, &ldquo;if she knew that we would use her
information for a personal attack upon Ames, she&rsquo;d leave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is
there?&rdquo; demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;no, I suppose not. But that will take additional
money. Very well, I&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;ll put a mortgage on my Ohio
holdings at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would be afraid,&rdquo; suggested Miss Wall.
&ldquo;We might not use the information Carmen may collect in
Avon or Washington, but something, I am sure, is bound to
come out of it. Something always comes out of what she does.
She&rsquo;s the greatest asset the Express has. We must use her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well and good,&rdquo; put in Haynerd. &ldquo;And yet, if she
finds anybody down there who needs help, even the President
himself, she&rsquo;ll throw the Express to the winds, just as she did
in Sidney&rsquo;s case. You can&rsquo;t bank on her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true, Ned, for while we preach she&rsquo;s off somewhere
practicing. We evolve great truths, and she applies and
demonstrates them. But she has saved Sidney&ndash;&ndash;her Christ
did it through her. And she has given the lad to us, a future
valuable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&ndash;&ndash;if we are to <i>have</i> any future,&rdquo; growled Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; retorted Hitt, brindling, &ldquo;have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien&rsquo;s spoken truth or nonsense?
If you believe our report, then accept and apply it.
Now who&rsquo;s to go to Avon with Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; suggested Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sid?&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd. &ldquo;Huh! Why, if those Magyars
down there discovered he was Ames&rsquo;s son, they&rsquo;d eat him
alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Hitt answered the call. Then, turning
to his companions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waite says he wants a meeting to-night. He&rsquo;d like to report
on his research work. Guess we&rsquo;d better call it. I&rsquo;ll inform
Morton. No telling when we may get together again, if
the girl&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He became suddenly silent, and sat some time
looking vacantly out through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She goes to Avon to-morrow,&rdquo; he abruptly announced,
&ldquo;alone.&rdquo; His thought had been dwelling on that &lsquo;something
not ourselves&rsquo; which he knew was shielding and sustaining
the girl.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and
significance for us are incalculable,&rdquo; said Father
Waite, standing before the little group which had
assembled in their usual meeting place in the first hours of
the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express. &ldquo;We have met to discuss briefly the meaning
of that marvelous record of a whole nation&rsquo;s search for
God, the Bible. As have been men&rsquo;s changing concepts of that
&lsquo;something not ourselves that makes for righteousness,&rsquo; so
have been individuals, tribes, and nations. The Bible records
the development of these concepts in Israel&rsquo;s thought; it records
the unquenchable longings of that people for truth; it
records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs, their philosophy,
their dreams, and their aspirations. To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable. And largely, I now believe, because we were
wont to approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of
literal, even verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read
into it the record of Israel&rsquo;s changing idea of God, from a
wrathful, consuming Lord of human caprice and passions, to
the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus revealed as the Christ-principle,
which worked through him and through all who are
gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who sits here
on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.
But he quickly stifled his emotion, and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our last meeting Mr. Hitt clearly showed us how the
so-called human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional
opposite of the mind that is God; and how through
countless ages of human reckoning that pseudo-mind has been
revealing its various types, until at length, rising ever higher
in the scale of being, it revealed its human man as a mentality
whose consciousness is the suppositional activity of false
thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental concepts out of
this kind of thought and posits them within itself as material
objects, as its own body, its universe, its all. And he showed
us how, little by little, that human mind&rsquo;s interpretations of
the infinite mind&rsquo;s true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now
known to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer
glimpse of truth, and became conscious of that &lsquo;something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_130' name='book4_page_130'></a>130</span>
not ourselves&rsquo; which makes for right-thinking, and consequent
correct mental concepts and externalizations. This, then, was
the starting point of our religion. These first glimpses of
truth, and their interpretations, as set forth in the writings of
the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of our Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But were these records exact statements of truth? Not
always. The primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful
glimpses of truth in legend and myth. And so in fable
and allegory the early Israelites sought to show the power of
good over evil, and thereby stimulate a desire for right conduct,
based, of course, on right-thinking. And thus it is that the
most significant thing in their sacred records is their many,
many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time passed. The Hebrew nation waxed prosperous.
Their right-thinking became externalized outwardly in material
abundance and physical comfort. But the people&rsquo;s understanding
was not sufficiently great to shield them from the
temptation which material wealth and power always constitute.
Their vision gradually became obscured. The mist of materialism
spread over it. Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased
to dart across their mental horizon. Their god became a magnified
concept of the human man, who dickered with them over
the construction of his temples, and who, by covenants, bribes,
and promises, induced them to behave themselves. Prophecy
died. And at length the beautiful vision faded quite away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then followed four hundred human years, during which
the vicissitudes of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.
But during those long centuries there developed that world
wonder, a whole nation&rsquo;s united longing for a deliverer! The
prophets promised a great change in their fallen fortunes.
Expectation grew keen. Desire expanded into yearning. Their
God would not forsake them. Was not His grace sufficient?
Though their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the
deliverer would come, he <i>must</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he did. In the depths of their night&ndash;&ndash;in the midst of
the heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world&ndash;&ndash;there arose
a great light. Through the densest ignorance of the human
mind filtered the Christ-principle, and was set forth by the
channel through which it came, the man Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had happened? Had there been a conference among
God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of
salvation to mankind, as recorded by the poet Milton? Alas!
what a crude, materialistic conception. Had God so loved the
world that He gave His only begotten Son? But God <i>is</i> Love,
infinite, unchanging. And His unique Son, the Christ-principle,
available to all mankind, was &lsquo;before Abraham.&rsquo; Had a great,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_131' name='book4_page_131'></a>131</span>
dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that, if
we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes? Had the
Jewish nation &lsquo;demonstrated&rsquo; the Christ? Had their centuries
of looking and expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested
to them? It was a period in the unfolding of human thought
when civilization had reached its lowest depths. Morality had
evaporated to the dregs. Rome was become the world&rsquo;s harlot.
A few years more, and Nero would drag his vulpine immorality
across the stage. Paganism was virtue in comparison with the
lust of men in that dark hour. And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all
history, bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Always our being is descending into us,&rsquo; said Emerson.
But our true being can be none other than infinite mind&rsquo;s idea
of itself. Our true individuality must be the way that mind
regards us. And thus it was that Israel&rsquo;s true being descended,
filtering in through the thick mists of error. That true being
was the deliverer, <i>par excellence</i>, for it was the message of
truth that bade men deny themselves, their carnal selves, and
know but the one God, infinite mind. That was the grace
sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; and his woes
and afflictions, and put on the &lsquo;new man,&rsquo; divine mind&rsquo;s image.
But the carnal mind sought a material kingdom. It wanted,
not spirit, but matter. It cruelly rejected the message-bearer,
and sought to kill his message by slaying him on the cross.
And thereby the Jewish nation rent itself asunder, and sank
into carnal oblivion. Ah, how they have been cursed by the
crucifixion of Jesus!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live? Or is he a mythical
character, like the gods of pagan Rome? Let us ask, in
making our reply, how truth comes to mankind? Is it not
always through some human channel? Then the great sayings
attributed to Jesus at least came from a human being.
Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.
Not conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a
preparation forced by events. The truth of a mathematical
principle can not come to me unless I am prepared to receive
it. And the greatest good comes to men only after they have
learned the nothingness of the material ambitions and aims
which they have been pursuing. By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth. The awfulness of its
own exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as
never before the human mind&rsquo;s absolute nothingness&ndash;&ndash;its nothingness
as regards real value, permanence, and genuine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_132' name='book4_page_132'></a>132</span>
good&ndash;&ndash;in that first century of our so-called Christian era. And
when the nothingness of the carnal mind was made plain, men
saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the Christ, back of
it all. The divine message was whispered to a human mentality.
And that mentality expanded under the God-influence,
until at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle
of salvation. Let us call that human mentality, for convenience,
the man Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, was he born of a virgin? Impossible! And yet&ndash;&ndash;let
us see. It was common enough in his day for virgins to
pretend to be with child by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not
criticise those who refuse to accept the dogma of the virgin
birth. But a little reflection in the light of what we have been
discussing throws a wonderful illumination upon the question.
If matter and material modes are real, then we must at once
relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the resurrection,
and the ascension to the realm of myth. If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently,
pass by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.
But, regarding matter as a human, mortal concept,
entirely mental, and wholly subject to the impress and influence
of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that <i>mental concepts
change with changed thought</i>, we are forced to look with more
favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows&rsquo; blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings
are interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite
mind, God, and its ideas. The most perfect human interpretation
of God&rsquo;s greatest idea, Man, was Christ Jesus. The <i>real</i>
selfhood of every one of us is God&rsquo;s idea of us. It is spiritual,
mental. The world calls it the &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; the &lsquo;divine essence,&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;immortal spark.&rsquo; The Christ was the real, spiritual selfhood
of the man Jesus. So the Christ is the real selfhood of
each of us. It is not born of the flesh. It is not conceived and
brought forth in conformity with human modes. Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and
birth? It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.
It is the &lsquo;unique&rsquo; Son of God which is back of each one of us.
But the world has seen it only once in its fullness, and then
through the man Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something happened in that first century of the so-called
Christian era&ndash;&ndash;something of tremendous significance. What
was it? It was the birth of the Christ-idea into the human
consciousness. Was the Christ-idea virgin-born? Aye, that
it was, for God, infinite Mind, alone was its origin and parent.
The speculation which has turned about that wonderful first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_133' name='book4_page_133'></a>133</span>
century event has dealt with the human channel through which
the Christ-idea flowed to mankind. But let us see what light
our deductions throw even upon that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we
now know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that
Israel&rsquo;s idea of God and man did fall, woefully. We see that
the Christ-principle appeared among men; we see that to-day
it works marvels; we must admit that throughout the ages
before Jesus it had done so; we know now that the great things
which Israel is recorded to have done were accomplished by
the Christ-principle working through men, and that when their
vision became obscured they lost the knowledge of that principle
and how to use it. History records the working of great
deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was re-born in our
first century; and we also can see how the obscuring of the
spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine&rsquo;s time
caused the loss of the Church&rsquo;s power to do great works. We
are forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality
of the Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.
Moses, Elisha, Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive
perceptions of truth, and all became channels for the passing
of the Christ-principle to mankind in some degree. But none
of these men ever illustrated that principle as did the man
Jesus. He is the most marvelous manifestation of God that
has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was the
manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father. It is quite true that
many of his great sayings were not original with him. Great
truths have been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest
times. But he demonstrated and made practical the truth in
these sayings. And he exposed the nothingness of the human
mental concept of matter by healing disease, walking the waves,
and in other wonderful ways. It is true that long before his
time Greek philosophers had hit upon the theory of the nothingness
of matter. Plato had said that only ideas were real.
But Jesus&ndash;&ndash;or the one who brought the Christ-message&ndash;&ndash;was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to
quote Carmen, that ever existed. Through him the divine
mind showed with almost unobscured fullness. God&rsquo;s existence
had been discerned and His goodness proved from time to time
by prophets and patriarchs, but by no means to the extent that
Jesus proved it. There were those before him who had asserted
that there was but one reality, and that human consciousness
was not the real self. There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as
in our own day. <i>But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_134' name='book4_page_134'></a>134</span>
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of
his whole material concept of the universe and man.</i> And it
remained for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie
about God. It was his mission to show that the devil was &lsquo;a
man-killer from the beginning,&rsquo; because it is the supposition
that there is power apart from God. It was his life purpose to
show mankind that there is nothing in this lie to cause fear,
and that it can be overcome by overcoming the false thought
which produces it. By overcoming that thought he showed
men the evanescent nature of sickness and death. And sin
he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of understanding
of what constitutes real good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a
whole people&rsquo;s search for God and their changing concept of
Him. Note that, wherever in its records evil seems to be made
real, it is for the purpose of uncovering and destroying it by
the vigorous statements of truth which you will almost invariably
find standing near the exposition of error. So evil seemed
very real in the first century of our era; but it was uncovered
by the coming of Jesus. The exposure of evil revealed the
Christ, right at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Haynerd, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get back to the question of
the virgin birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;But let us first consider
what human birth is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there!&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd. &ldquo;Now you are touching
my lifelong question. If I am immortal, where was I before I
was born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of which &lsquo;I&rsquo; are you speaking, Ned?&rdquo; asked Father Waite.
&ldquo;The real &lsquo;I&rsquo; is God&rsquo;s image and likeness, His reflection. It was
never born, and never dies. The human &lsquo;I&rsquo; had a beginning.
And therefore it will cease to be. The human mind makes its
own laws, and calls them laws of nature, or even God&rsquo;s laws.
And it obeys them like a slave. Because God is both Father and
Mother to His children, His ideas, the human mind has decreed
in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both male and
female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind. Do you see how it imitates
the divine in an apish sort of way? And so elements of
each sex-type of the human mind are employed in the formation
of another, their offspring. The process is wholly mental,
and is one of human belief, quite apart from the usage of the
divine Mind, who &lsquo;spake and it was done,&rsquo; mentally unfolding
a spiritual creation. The real &lsquo;you,&rsquo; Ned, has always existed
as God&rsquo;s idea of Himself. It is spiritual, not material. It will
come to light as the material &lsquo;you&rsquo; is put off. The material
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_135' name='book4_page_135'></a>135</span>
&lsquo;you&rsquo; did not exist before it was humanly born. It was produced
in supposition by the union of the parent human minds,
which themselves were reflections of the male and female
characteristics of the communal mortal mind. It thus had a
definite, supposititious beginning. It will therefore have a
definite end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I&rsquo;m doomed to annihilation, eh? That&rsquo;s a comforting
thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed
to extinction. That which is supposition must go out. Oh,
it doubtless will not all be destroyed when you pass through
that change which we call death. It may linger until you have
passed through many such experiences. And so it behooves
you to set about getting rid of it as soon as possible, and thus
avoid the unpleasant experience of countless death-throes.
You see, Ned, an error in the premise will appear in the conclusion.
Now you are starting with the premise that the
human &lsquo;you&rsquo; is real. That premise is not based upon fact.
Its basis is rank error. All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away. Human beings know nothing
of their origin, nor of their existence. Why? <i>Because there
is nothing to know about them; they are entirely supposititious!</i>
Paul says, in his letter to the Romans: &lsquo;They which
are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God.&rsquo;
The birth of the children of the flesh is wholly a human-mind
process. The infant mentality thus produced knows nothing
whatsoever of itself. It has no knowledge; is not founded on
truth. It will later manifest hereditary beliefs, showing the
results of prenatal mesmerism. Then it will receive the general
assortment of human thought and opinion&ndash;&ndash;very little of
it based on actual truth&ndash;&ndash;which the world calls education.
Then it learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.
And soon it attributes its origin to God. But the prenatal
error will appear in the result. The being manifests
every gradation of human thought; it grows; it suffers and
enjoys materially; it bases its very existence upon matter; it
manifests the false activity of human thought in material consciousness;
and then it externalizes its beliefs, the consentaneous
human beliefs, upon its body and in its environment; and
finally, the activity of the false thought which constitutes its
consciousness ceases&ndash;&ndash;and the being dies. Yes, its death will
be due to sin, to &lsquo;<i>hamartio</i>,&rsquo; missing the mark. It never knew
God. And that, Ned, is human life, so-called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death is not in any sense a cessation of life. The being
who dies never knew what it was to live. Death is the externalization
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_136' name='book4_page_136'></a>136</span>
of human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon
real knowledge, truth. And so, human birth is itself death.
Paul said: &lsquo;They that are after the flesh do mind the things
of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the
spirit.&rsquo; In other words, mankind are striving terribly, desperately,
to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly existence. But
they can&rsquo;t do it. They are foredoomed to failure, despite the
discovery of antitoxins. In the book of Job we read: &lsquo;The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
hath given me life.&rsquo; Where, then, is the reality in prenatal
mesmerism and the drag of heredity? It is all supposition,
all a part of the one lie, the &lsquo;man-killer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change called death comes to all mortals. It is the
culmination of the human mind&rsquo;s sense of limitation. It does
not usher them into immortal, illimitable bliss. It but leaves
them upon another seeming plane of mortal thought, there to
drag out another sense of existence, unless they have so learned
the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable them to overcome
death. It will not be overcome for us. That is our work. We
have been shown how to do it. Why, then, do we waste our
time in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in
the vain strife for sensual pleasures? The mortal will live and
die, and live and die, until at last he is beaten into line and
forced to demonstrate the Christ-principle. Hadn&rsquo;t we better
begin that right here and now? Wishing to die doesn&rsquo;t solve
our problems. Suicide only makes us start again, worse off
than before. We shall overcome death when we have overcome
sin, for the physical manifestation called death is but the
externalization in conscious experience of spiritual death&ndash;&ndash;lack
of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies,
their Masses, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have woefully missed the mark, Ned. They are all
but spiritually dead. But I see protest rising in our good
friends, Doctor Siler and Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on,
for we have much ground still to cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is
it possible that the man Jesus was &lsquo;born of a virgin&rsquo;? Quite
so; but, more, <i>no man ever conceived and born in the way
human beings are generated has ever begun to approach Jesus
in degree of spirituality</i>. If he had been born in human ways,
is it likely that he would ever have developed such intense
spirituality? Well, not in a brief thirty-three years or so!
And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in some
way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_137' name='book4_page_137'></a>137</span>
understandable at all to the human mind? I think not. He
would have been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above
human perception. If he had been conceived by the union of
the two sexes, as is the mortal-mind mode of generation, would
he not have been too material to have so quickly developed
that spirituality which made him the light of the world at the
age of thirty-three? I think it is a fair question. The theory
of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the need of a sort
of middle course, whereby the man should not be too human
to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be
appreciable to other human minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must
have regarded matter as unreal, as nothingness. His works
plainly show that. And they as plainly show that he came
from the Father. His whole life was such as to render the
virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it. How otherwise can
we explain him? And from a study of the Gospels I simply
can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame
all material laws, overcame the world of matter, and
even at the last dematerialized his material body. It&rsquo;s an
astonishing thought&ndash;&ndash;and yet, who can show that it is not true?
There are some things that reason insists on our accepting,
despite the paucity of human records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, Mr. Waite,&rdquo; said Doctor Morton, &ldquo;that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the
virgin birth. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;And I will go further:
Biblical research during the past few years seems to have established
the conclusion that Mark&rsquo;s Gospel antedates the others,
but that prior to it there existed a collection of sayings by
Jesus, called the <i>Logia</i>. This collection of sayings seems to
have been originally written in Aramaic, the language Jesus
spoke. Now Matthew Arnold tells us that the Gospel narratives
passed through at least fifty years of oral tradition before
they became fixed in the form in which we now have them.
Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin birth
arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed! Matthew and Luke alone speak
of the virgin birth. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel we believe to have been
written by Mark himself. And we believe that Papias, who
wrote about the middle of the second century, spoke truly
when he said: &lsquo;Mark having become (or having been) Peter&rsquo;s
interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all that Peter
related) though he did not (record) in order that which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_138' name='book4_page_138'></a>138</span>
said or done by Christ.&rsquo; In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his. Now
Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and
the Collection of sayings. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel does not mention the
virgin birth; the Collection probably did. Also, Matthew probably
did not write the Gospel attributed to him; but he almost
certainly did write the Collection of sayings, from which in
part the present Gospel according to Matthew was compiled.
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel was undoubtedly written by the physician Luke,
Paul&rsquo;s companion, and depended largely for its data upon
Mark&rsquo;s Gospel and the Collection of Matthew. Yet we can not
say that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to
Mark and John of the virgin birth renders the story a legend,
in view of our own present great knowledge of the constitution
of matter, of material laws, and of the fact that the virgin
birth is at least rendered credible by the subsequent very
extraordinary career of Jesus. Moreover, remember that our
New Testament is a small book, and that it is quite probable
that a great mass of literature existed on the subject of Jesus
and his work, and that it is possible that other of the disciples
wrote treatises, perhaps many of them. How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.
Perhaps none; perhaps all. But this conclusion at least we
must accept: the validity of the story of the virgin birth does
<i>not</i> rest with the four Gospels which have come down to us
out of the great mass of literature which probably once existed.
Rather is the probability of the immaculate conception
a function of our present knowledge of matter, its pseudo-laws,
and the great fact that the entire life of Jesus as reported
in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that his birth was
not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept that,&rdquo; said Hitt. &ldquo;I believe you are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Carmen, &ldquo;can not see that the origin of the
human channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to
mankind is of any consequence. The principle has always
existed. Jesus said that it existed before Abraham. It alone
is the important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; replied Father Waite. &ldquo;It has been said that
the immaculate conception was the result of Mary&rsquo;s realization
that real man is the son of God. This is a beautiful thought.
Certainly Jesus did seem to manifest some such metaphysical
idea. Perhaps Mary was a woman of tremendous force of
character. Perhaps it did come to her that her son should be
the Messiah of his race. Jesus certainly did acquire the messianic
consciousness&ndash;&ndash;and thereby upheaved the world. But,
whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_139' name='book4_page_139'></a>139</span>
was brought into the world because of the world&rsquo;s tremendous
need. It came as a response. It is only the confusing
of the Christ with the man Jesus that is so largely responsible
for the weakness of orthodox theology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the
Pentateuch is composed of a variety of documents written by
various authors. We have no positive proof that Moses had
aught to do with its authorship, although parts of it may be
based on data which either he originated or sanctioned. The
books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources. The book of
Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two persons,
both men of marvelous spiritual vision. The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem. The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it. It is a ringing protest
against conventional theology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly
concerned, for we believe it to contain the method of salvation
from human ills. None of the original documents are extant,
of course. And yet, the most searching textual criticism goes
to show that the New Testament books as we have them to-day
are genuine reproductions of the original documents, with but
very little adulteration of erroneous addition by later hands.
This means much to us. I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels. The book of Acts certainly was written by the
author of the third Gospel, Luke. First Peter was composed by
the disciple Peter, or was written under his sanction. The
Gospel of John and the book of First John were written by one
and the same author&ndash;&ndash;but whether by the disciple John or
not, I can not say. If this great disciple did not write the
Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems to be felt all through
it. The probability is that he knew what was in it, and approved
of it, although the actual composition may have been by
another, possibly a very learned Greek. To me, the Fourth
Gospel is the most masterly work ever composed by man. It
stands absolutely alone. The criticism that John, being a
Jew, could not have composed it, falls before the greater truth
that, having become a Christian, he was no longer a Jew. He
was a new creature. For how could he have been other, seeing
that he had lived with Jesus?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of
the New Testament. I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably
his. To these we can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity,
Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians. As
to the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, there is still doubt. These
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_140' name='book4_page_140'></a>140</span>
letters were written to the various Churches chronologically,
as I have mentioned them. It has been said that Jesus was
way over the heads of his reporters. That was inevitable.
Even Paul misunderstood him at times. But&ndash;&ndash;and here is the
important fact for us&ndash;&ndash;Paul&rsquo;s letters exhibit a marvelous spiritual
growth in the man, and show him at last to be the grand
master-metaphysician of the Christian era. Has it ever occurred
to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual? The material is all but neglected by their composers.
Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel
narrators seemed to have been but slightly concerned. But
with the delineation of the Christ&ndash;&ndash;ah! that was their theme.
They were not writing a biography. They were painting a
spiritual portrait. In the light of this great truth the apparent
lack of harmony in the Gospel narratives loses significance.
And how little there is in the Gospels of theology, of institution,
of organization! How trifling are creed and doctrine, how little
are Catholicism and Protestantism, compared with the stupendous
fact that God is, and that His truth, the Christ-principle,
is still here to-day and available!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so with Paul, he was expounding the &lsquo;method and
secret&rsquo; of the Christ. And he first had to work up to it himself.
He may have thought, when he wrote his first letter to
the Thessalonians, that the man Jesus would come again in the
skies, with great pomp and surrounded by the Saints. But in
his second letter he states plainly that the Christ will come
when the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; is laid off. Not much occasion for misunderstanding
there, I think. Indeed, after Jesus so clearly
stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on
the subject of the second coming of the Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; interposed Reverend Moore, &ldquo;that the Epistle
to the Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment
after death, in a heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly
consistent with your remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Epistle to the Hebrews,&rdquo; returned Father Waite, &ldquo;was
not written by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.
But, read Paul&rsquo;s wonderful eighth chapter of Romans. Read
his third chapter of First Corinthians. Read all his letters in
the order in which I have mentioned them, which was as they
were written, and you can not fail to grasp his marvelous expanding
perception of the Christ-principle; the nothingness of
the material concept; the impotence of the lie that opposes
God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of right-thinking
if one would work out his salvation from the errors that assail
mankind. Paul shows that he passed through a &lsquo;belief period,&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_141' name='book4_page_141'></a>141</span>
and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable understanding
at last. If men had followed him they never could
have fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination,
infant damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all
the other theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions
which all can verify. The trouble is, <i>mankind have not tried
to verify them</i>! They have relegated all that to the life beyond
the grave. I fear a sorry disappointment awaits them, for,
even as Paul says, they will be after the change called death
only what they were before. It is like recovering from a case
of sickness, for sickness and death are alike manifestations of
mortal thought. We awake from each still human, still with
our problems before us. We must break the mesmerism of
the belief that the practical application of Jesus&rsquo; teachings
must be relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.
We must apply the Christ-principle, and learn to hit
the mark, for sin is always weakness, never strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the
Christ, we are bidden to acknowledge him&ndash;&ndash;that is, to <i>act-our-knowledge</i>.
Many of the world&rsquo;s philosophers have worked
out great truths. But they have rested content with that. Many
scientists, knowing that matter is unreal, nevertheless conduct
themselves <i>as if it constituted the one and only real fact of
existence</i>! Is error like truth? Decidedly no! It is truth&rsquo;s
exact opposite. Is truth real? Certainly it is! Then its opposite
<i>can not</i> be real. The human mentality holds the belief
that there is something apart from God, spirit. That belief
becomes objectified in the human mentality as matter. And
within matter is contained all evil of every sort and name.
Evil is not, as the philosophers would have us believe, a lower
form of good. It is not &lsquo;good in the making.&rsquo; It is always
error, the direct opposite of truth. And if truth is real and
eternal, error can not be. See the grave mistake in which
Emerson became enmeshed. He said: &lsquo;There seems to be a
necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.&rsquo; Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion. If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and
evil, fair and foul, life and death&ndash;&ndash;and which is good, and
which bad? All is alike the reflection of God. No, my friends,
rather accept Jesus&rsquo; statement that evil is the lie, of which no
man need be afraid, and which all must and shall overcome.
And the &lsquo;old man,&rsquo; with all his material concepts of nature and
the universe, must and will be laid off, thus revealing the spiritual
man, the image and likeness of the one divine Mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_142' name='book4_page_142'></a>142</span>
block to the acceptance of the Gospels. Are they, together
with the entire Gospel narrative, legendary? If so, they must
have arisen during those fifty years between Jesus and the
recording of the narratives. But this very period is covered
by Paul&rsquo;s letters, which record his thought. And even the
most relentless of Bible critics admit the genuineness of Paul&rsquo;s
authorship of the Epistles to the Romans, the Corinthians, the
Thessalonians, and the Galatians. If the Gospel narratives are
legends, they grew up and found acceptance in fifty years. A
pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into consideration
the inherent incredulity of the human mind! As Dean Farrar
says: &lsquo;Who would have <i>invented</i>, who would have merely
<i>imagined</i>, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had
seen and known Jesus. And we are forced to admit that Paul
was a very strong, sane man. These legends could not have
grown up in his day and been accepted by him. And as long
as there were men living who had known Jesus&ndash;&ndash;and that must
have been as late as the last quarter of the first century&ndash;&ndash;the
true events of Jesus&rsquo; life could hardly have given way to a set
of childish legends. As a matter of recorded fact, the various
Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion. And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists
were written at a time when the sick were still being healed
and even the dead raised by the practical application of Jesus&rsquo;
teachings. Hence, miracles did not astonish them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own inability to perform the works attributed to
Jesus is hardly sufficient ground for denying the belief that
he really did them. For what is a miracle? Certainly that the
greater portion of the New Testament was written by a few
fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker is one of the most
stupendous miracles on record! And the miracle of miracles
is Jesus Christ himself! Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws&ndash;&ndash;the so-called laws of nature&ndash;&ndash;the
world says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and
that his reporters were hypnotized, deluded! And yet I tell
you that he did not break a single law! He did act in defiance
of the so-called testimony of the physical senses, which has
always been accepted by mankind as law. We now know
what that sense-testimony is&ndash;&ndash;human, mortal thought. He
did rise above human consciousness of evil. And because he
did so, he instantaneously healed the sick. A miracle expresses,
not the beliefs of the human mind, but the law of
God, infinite mind, and makes that law conceivable to the human
mentality. God&rsquo;s laws are <i>never</i> set aside, for by very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_143' name='book4_page_143'></a>143</span>
definition a law is immutable, else it ceases to be law. But
when the human mind grows out of itself sufficiently to perceive
those laws and to express them to its fellow-minds, the
result is called a miracle. Moreover, the ability to perform
miracles is but a function of spirituality. A miracle is a sign
of one&rsquo;s having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws. The consciousness that knows
no evil will perform miracles. The early Christians did great
works. These works were the &lsquo;signs following,&rsquo; and attested
their knowledge of the allness of God. A miracle is simply a
proof of God. Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lewis!&rdquo; protested the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me say it, please. Carmen <i>knew</i> that no power opposed
to God could hold Sidney. And the &lsquo;sign&rsquo; followed. Yes,
she performed a miracle. She broke a human-mind, so-called
law, a limitation. She proved God&rsquo;s law of harmony and holiness&ndash;&ndash;wholeness&ndash;&ndash;to
be omnipresent and omnipotent. And,
mark me, friends, <i>every one of us must learn to do likewise</i>!
Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works which
he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His works were done for a special reason, Mr. Waite,&rdquo;
interposed Reverend Moore. &ldquo;They were to testify to his
messiahship. They are not required of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.
Then he went on gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could
have been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox
theology. Christianity is <i>so</i> simple! Why should even
the preachers themselves condemn the one who seeks to obey
Christ? Mr. Moore, the real man is God&rsquo;s highest idea of
Himself. The human mind makes mental concepts of God&rsquo;s
man. And Jesus was the grandest concept of God&rsquo;s idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means
of its interpretations. He was the image of truth. One of
his grandest characteristics was his implicit obedience to his
vision of the Father. And he demanded just as implicit obedience
from us. But he bade us, again and again, <i>heal the sick
and raise the dead</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heal the sick! We have our physicians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned&ndash;&ndash;with
the result that he &lsquo;slept with his fathers.&rsquo; There is no
more ironical statement in the whole Bible than that. We turn
to our physicians because we have no faith in God. <i>Materia
medica</i> physicians do <i>not</i> heal the sick. They sometimes succeed
in causing the human mind temporarily to substitute a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_144' name='book4_page_144'></a>144</span>
belief of health for a belief of disease that is all. But Jesus
and the early Christians healed by true prayer&ndash;&ndash;the prayer of
affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God. And that was done through an understanding
of God as immutable law, or principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you pray to a principle?&rdquo; demanded Reverend
Moore, with a note of contempt in his voice. &ldquo;I prefer my own
concept of God, as one who hears our petitions, and pities us,
and not as a lifeless principle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is principle, Mr. Moore,&rdquo; replied Father Waite, &ldquo;in that
He is &lsquo;<i>that by which all is</i>.&rsquo; And in order to be such He must
be, as the Bible says, &lsquo;the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.&rsquo;
He must be immovable, regardless of human pleading and
petition. And so true prayer, the prayer that draws an answer,
is not an objective appeal to Him, but is an intelligent
application of the Christ-principle to all our problems and
needs. Such prayer will remove mountains in proportion to
the understanding and motive back of it. And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs
here among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant,
and begging that He will stoop down and remove it. It is the
prayer that manifests man&rsquo;s oneness with the infinite mind
as its image, reflecting a knowledge of the allness of good and
the consequent unreality and powerlessness of evil, the lie
about it. It was healing by such prayer, Mr. Moore, that the
Episcopal Synod rejected only recently. Instead of doing the
healing themselves by means of the principle given them, they
still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to do it
for them, provided the very uncertain science of <i>materia medica</i>
fails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true method of prayer was employed by the early
Christians, until the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured
and finally lost to the Church by its bargaining with
Constantine for a mess of pottage, namely, temporal power.
Then began to rise that great worldly institution, the so-called
Holy Church. In the first half of the sixth century Justinian
closed the schools of philosophy at Athens. For a while
Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.
And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of
faith, which issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition
grafted upon paganism. Theology and ritualism divided the
gospel of healing the sick and saving the sinner into two
radically different systems, neither of which is Christian, and
neither of which can either heal or save. Since then, lip-service
and ceremonial have taken the place of healing the sick and
raising the dead. The world again slipped back steadily from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_145' name='book4_page_145'></a>145</span>
the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics constitutes our
religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat enthroned
the healing Christ-principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would remind you, Mr. Waite, that I have Catholic leanings
myself,&rdquo; said Doctor Siler. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear either my
religion or my profession abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My criticism, Doctor,&rdquo; replied Father Waite, &ldquo;is but an
exposure of the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be
ascertained from its fruits. The Roman Church has been an
age-long instigator of wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions
throughout the world. Its assumption that its creed is
the only religious truth is an insult to the world&rsquo;s expanding
intelligence. Its arrogant claim to speak with the authority
of God is one of the anomalies of this century of enlightenment.
Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a continuous
tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor and ignorant! Are you unmindful of the
Church&rsquo;s schools and hospitals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor. Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success
of Christianity is <i>not</i> measured by hospitals. Rather,
their continuance attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox
misinterpretation. I have been a priest, Doctor. I do not want
to see this splendid country forced into the iron shackles of
priestcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can not happen here!&rdquo; cried Haynerd, pounding the
table with his fist. &ldquo;The time has passed when a man can say,
&lsquo;My church, be she right or wrong, but my church!&rsquo; and insist
that it shall be forced upon us, whether we like it or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; continued Father Waite, &ldquo;the Romanist has always
missed the mark. He prayed to a God of love to give him
power to exterminate heretics&ndash;&ndash;those who differed with him in
belief. But he prayed with iniquity, hatred, murder in his
heart; and God, who is too pure to know evil, heard him not.
Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent <i>good</i>. Is it good to
murder one&rsquo;s fellow-men? The Psalmist wrote: &lsquo;If I regard
iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.&rsquo; That is why
the Church&rsquo;s prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself
is a failing institution to-day. I say this in pity, not in
malice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate,&rdquo; returned the
doctor. &ldquo;Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love&ndash;&ndash;hatred
of all that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word
of God.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_146' name='book4_page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God
is love. You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make
evil real. Indeed, the Church has always emphasized evil as a
great and living reality. How could it ever hope to overcome
it then? Your Church, Doctor, has little of the meekness of
the Christ, and so, little of his strength. It has little of his
spirituality. Its numbers and great material wealth do not
constitute power. Its assumptions remind me of the ancient
Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud. You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it,
and turn to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.
When you have learned to do the works he did, then will you
have justified yourself and your faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen
and taken her place at the piano. When he concluded, she
began to play and sing softly. As the sweet melody flowed out
through the room the little group became silent and thoughtful.
Again it was that same weird lament which the girl had
sung long before in the Elwin school to voice the emotions
which surged up in her during her loneliness in the great city.
In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing sighs of
the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.
Hitt&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast as he listened. Haynerd tried
to speak, but choked. The Beaubien buried her face in her
hands and wept softly. The lines about Doctor Siler&rsquo;s mouth
relaxed, and his lips trembled. He rose quietly and went
around to where Father Waite sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He bent and took Father Waite&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;We are&ndash;&ndash;friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about
the doctor. &ldquo;We are more than that, Doctor,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;We are brothers. And in reality we are both, here and now,
beloved children of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Siler bowed. Then he nodded to the others, and took
his departure. As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Doctor, that we love you, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your love,&rdquo; he murmured, as he bent over her hand, &ldquo;is
from the Christ. Nay, it <i>is</i> the Christ himself among us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have said more, but his voice broke. Then he
went out.</p>
<p>When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left,
Haynerd, who had remained for a moment to speak to Father
Waite, turned to the Beaubien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Hitt is a remarkable man. He is
conducting a remarkable newspaper. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He stopped and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_147' name='book4_page_147'></a>147</span>
looked at Carmen. &ldquo;Well, if I mistake not, his quietness this
evening indicated his belief that this might be our last meeting
for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd shook his head dubiously. Then, abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up
to-morrow in Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl. &ldquo;You are going to
Avon to-morrow? Don&rsquo;t! Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; There was a look
of fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her
cheek. &ldquo;Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien bowed her head. She knew it was so.</p>
<p>And the girl went early the next morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>
</div>
<p>The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along
Avon creek, from which its first manufacturing industries
derived their motive power. Years before, when it was
little more than a barren stretch of sand, some enterprising
soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few primitive
looms. As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously. But shortly after the death of the senior
Ames the company became involved, through mismanagement,
with the result that, to protect itself, the house of Ames and
Company, the largest creditor, was obliged to take over its
mills.</p>
<p>At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of
the defunct company, despite the loss to his bank. But then,
after a visit of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain
ideas which had occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.
The banging of the looms, the whirr of the pickers, the
sharp little shrieks of the spinning machines, fascinated him,
as he stood before them. They seemed to typify the ceaseless
throbbing of his own great brain. They seemed, too, to afford
another outlet for that mighty flood of materialistic thought
and energy which flowed incessantly through it.</p>
<p>And so he set about reorganizing the business. He studied
the process of cloth manufacture. He studied the growth and
handling of cotton. He familiarized himself with every detail
of the cotton market. He was already well versed in the intricacies
of the tariff. And soon the idle machinery was roaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_148' name='book4_page_148'></a>148</span>
again. Soon the capacity of the mills was doubled. And
soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become a
corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of
the century just closed.</p>
<p>When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she
stood for a moment looking uncertainly about her. Everywhere
on one side as far as she could see were low, ramshackle
frame houses; a few brick store buildings stood far up the main
street; and over at her right the enormous brick mills loomed
high above the frozen stream. The dull roar of the machinery
drifted through the cold air to her ears. Up the track, along
which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children were
picking up bits of coal. The sight seemed to fix her decision.
She went directly to them, and asked their names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anton Spivak,&rdquo; answered one of the children dully, when
she laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over dere,&rdquo; pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds.
&ldquo;Me an&rsquo; him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain&rsquo;t no work
fer us now. Dey&rsquo;s on half time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me to your home,&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>
<p>The boy looked his astonishment. &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t nobody to
home,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;De ol&rsquo; man an&rsquo; woman works in de mills
daytimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come-a home wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; spoke up the boy&rsquo;s companion, a
bright-faced little urchin of some ten years who had given his
name as Tony Tolesi. &ldquo;We lives in de tenements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at him for a moment. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance,
then turned and wended their course, through narrow
streets and byways, down toward the mills. In a few minutes
they were in the district where stood the great frame structures
built by the Ames company to house its hands. Block after
block of these they passed, massive, horrible, decrepit things,
and at last stopped at a grease-stained, broken door, which
the little fellow pushed open. The hall beyond was dark and
cold. Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while he
trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home. At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into
a narrow staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have
mounted it. Up four of these broken flights Carmen toiled
after him, and then down a long, desolate corridor, which sent
a chill into the very marrow of her bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis is where we lives, Missy,&rdquo; announced the little fellow.
&ldquo;Miss-a Marcus, she live in dere,&rdquo; pointing to the door directly
opposite. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t got only one arm.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_149' name='book4_page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>He pushed open the door before which they had halted. A
rush of foul air and odors of cooking swept out. They enveloped
the girl and seemed to hurl her back. A black-haired
woman, holding a crying baby in her arms, rose hastily from
an unmade bed at one side of the room. Two little girls, six
or eight years of age, and a boy still younger, ranged about
their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis-a lady, she come to visit,&rdquo; announced Carmen&rsquo;s guide
abruptly, pointing a dirty finger at her.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a
foreign tongue to the little fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She say,&rdquo; the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread
over his face, &ldquo;she say she don&rsquo;t spik <i>Inglese</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I speak your language,&rdquo; said the girl, going quickly to
her and extending a hand. Then, in that soft tongue which is
music celestial to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable
shores, she added, &ldquo;I want to know you; I want to talk
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced quickly about the room. A littered, greasy
cook stove stood in one corner. Close to it at either end were
wooden couches, upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads
and blankets, stained and grimy. A broken table, a decrepit
chest of drawers, and a few rickety chairs completed the complement
of furniture. The walls were unadorned, except for
a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster had fallen away
in many places. There was only one window in the room. Several
of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.</p>
<p>At the sound of her own language the woman&rsquo;s expression
changed. A light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly
took the proffered hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&ndash;&ndash;from Italy?&rdquo; she said in her native tongue.
Then, sweeping the girl&rsquo;s warm attire with a quick glance, &ldquo;You
are rich! Why do you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little boy brought me. And I am glad he did. No, I
am not from Italy. I am rich, yes, but not in money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood
scattering. At another sharp command little Tony set out a
soiled, broken chair for Carmen. But before the girl could take
it the woman&rsquo;s voice again rose sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she commanded, turning fiercely upon Carmen.
&ldquo;You are&ndash;&ndash;what do you say? slumming. You come with your
gay party to look us over and go away laughing! No! You
can not stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen did not smile. But reaching out, she gently lifted
the heavy baby from the woman&rsquo;s arms and sat down with it.
For a moment she patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.
Then she looked up at the bewildered mother.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_150' name='book4_page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have come here,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;because I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s lips parted in astonishment. She turned
dully and sat down on one of the begrimed beds. Her little
ones gathered about her, their soiled fingers in their mouths, or
clutching their tattered gowns, as they gazed at the beautiful
creature who had suddenly come into their midst.</p>
<p>Then the woman found her voice again. &ldquo;Eh! You are
from the mission? You come to talk of heaven? But I am
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not from the mission,&rdquo; replied the girl gently. &ldquo;I
have come to talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and
of Tony,&rdquo; smiling down into the eager face of the little boy as
he stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have Tony!&rdquo; cried the mother, starting up. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t take any of my children! The judge took Pietro Corrello&rsquo;s
boy last week&ndash;&ndash;but you can&rsquo;t have mine! Go away from
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your children,&rdquo; said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother. &ldquo;I want you. I want you to
help me to help all of these people here who need us. The
mills are running only half time, aren&rsquo;t they? The people do
not have enough to eat. But we, you and I, are going to make
things better for them, for everybody here, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; she went on hastily, to further allay the poor
woman&rsquo;s fears and to check additional protest, &ldquo;suppose we
plan our dinner. Let&rsquo;s see, Tony, what would you like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s lips instantly parted. His eyes began to glisten.
He glanced inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from
her. Then he could no longer contain himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spaghetti!&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;Soup! Buns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman.
&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;While we are gone, Tony and the
children will wash the dishes and set the table. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the
girl, then at her children, and then about the miserable room
in which they were huddled. Amazement and confusion sat
upon her heavy features. Then these gave way to another
dark look of suspicion. She opened her mouth&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and
threw an arm about her. Then the girl quickly drew the
startled woman to her and kissed her on the cheek. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
she whispered, &ldquo;get your shawl. We&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s universal language is the language of love. All nations,
all tribes understand it. The flood-gates, long barred,
swiftly opened, and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing
upon the bed. She could not comprehend what it was that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_151' name='book4_page_151'></a>151</span>
had come so unannounced into her dreary existence that cold
winter morning. People were not wont to treat her so. Her
life had been an endless, meaningless struggle against misery,
want, grinding oppression. People did not put their arms
around her and kiss her thus. They scoffed at her, they
abused her, they fought with her! She hated them, and the
world in which she lived!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing
woman&rsquo;s head upon her shoulder. &ldquo;But things will be
better now. Love has found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman suddenly raised up. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you are&ndash;&ndash;from
heaven? An angel?&rdquo; She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious
look came into her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carmen softly, taking the cue, &ldquo;I am an angel,
right from heaven. Now you are no longer afraid of me, are
you? Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.
Carmen gave a few directions to the gaping children. And as
she went out into the bleak hall with the woman she heard one
of them whisper in tones of awe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony, she said she&ndash;&ndash;she was&ndash;&ndash;an angel! Quick! Get
down on your knees and cross yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists
that rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot <i>llanos</i>,
goes the ceaseless cry of humanity. Oh, if the god of the
preachers were real, his heart must have long since broken!
Upward it streams, this soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden,
dull-brained toiler at the crashing loom; up from the wretched
outcast woman, selling herself to low passions to escape the
slavery of human exploitation; up from the muttering, ill-fed
wreck, whose life has been cashed into dividends, whose dry,
worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap; up from the
white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes lie under
little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary textile
burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.</p>
<p>Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering
group of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only
full meal that they could remember. And with them sat the
still bewildered mother, straining her dark eyes at the girl, and
striving to see in her a human being, a woman like herself. At
her right sat the widow Marcus, who lived just across the hall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_152' name='book4_page_152'></a>152</span>
Her husband had been crushed to death in one of the pickers
two years before. The company had paid her a hundred dollars,
but had kept back five for alleged legal fees. She herself
had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago, because
the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tony!&rdquo; said the mother at length, as a sense of the
reality of life suddenly returned to her. &ldquo;The lunch for your
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his
mouth, and went for the battered dinner pail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning,&rdquo; she
explained to Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the
mills with the pail unwontedly full. &ldquo;And he does not leave
until five-thirty. He was a weaver, and he earned sometimes
ten dollars a week. But he didn&rsquo;t last. He wore out. And so
he had to take a job as carder. He earns about eight dollars a
week now. But sometimes only six or seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t live on that, with your children!&rdquo; exclaimed
Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we could,&rdquo; replied the woman, &ldquo;if the work was steady.
But it isn&rsquo;t. You see, if I could work steady, and the children
too, we could live. I am a good spinner. And I am not nearly
so worn out as he is. I have several years left in me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association
with Italian immigrants since childhood, added her
comments from time to time. She was a gray-haired, kindly
soul, bearing no enmity toward the man to whom she had
yielded her husband&rsquo;s life and her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s no good in the mills after he&rsquo;s fifty,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You see, Miss, it&rsquo;s all piece-work, and a man has to be most
terribly spry and active. The strain is something awful, day
after day, in the noise and bad air, and having to keep your
eyes fixed on your work for ten hours at a stretch; and he wears
out fast. Then he has to take a job where he can&rsquo;t make so
much. And when he&rsquo;s about fifty he&rsquo;s no good for the mills
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; asked Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he hasn&rsquo;t any children, he goes to the poor-house.
But, if he has, then they take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then mill workers must have large families?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve got to, Miss. The little ones must work in the
mills, too. These mills here take them on when they are only
twelve, or even younger. Tony has worked there, and he is
only ten. It&rsquo;s against the law; but Mr. Ames gets around the
law some way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_153' name='book4_page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Mrs. Marcus, how do you live?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? Oh, I manage. The company paid me some money
two years ago, and I haven&rsquo;t spent all of it yet. Besides, I work
round a bit. I&rsquo;m pretty spry with one arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you do not pay rent for your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I have only one room. It&rsquo;s small. There&rsquo;s no
window in it. It&rsquo;s an inside room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you pay rent&ndash;&ndash;to Mr. Ames&ndash;&ndash;the man whose machines
killed your husband and took off your arm&ndash;&ndash;you still pay rent
to him, for one little room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. He owns these tenements. Why, his company
gave me almost a hundred dollars, you know! I was lucky,
for when Lizzie Sidel&rsquo;s man lost his hand in the cog wheels he
went to law to sue the company, and three years afterward the
case was thrown out of court and he had to pay the costs himself.
But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little hand stole up along Carmen&rsquo;s arm. She looked down
into the wondering face of the child. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I just wanted to see,
<i>Signorina</i>, if you were real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been wondering that myself, dear,&rdquo; replied the girl,
as her thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go now, Miss,&rdquo; said the widow Marcus, rising. &ldquo;I
promised to drop in and look after Katie Hoolan&rsquo;s children this
afternoon. She&rsquo;s up at the mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will go with you,&rdquo; Carmen announced. &ldquo;But I will
come back here,&rdquo; she added, as some little hands seized hers.
&ldquo;If not to-day, then soon&ndash;&ndash;perhaps to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the cold hall with Mrs. Marcus, and entered the
doorway which led to the little inner room where dwelt the
widow. There were a dozen such rooms in the building, the
latter informed her. This one in particular had been shunned
for many years, for it had a bad reputation as a breeder of
tuberculosis. But the rent was low, and so the widow had
taken it after her man was killed. It contained a broken stove,
a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs. The odor was
fetid. The walls were damp, and the paper which had once
covered them was molding and rotting off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t stay on,&rdquo; the widow explained, as she saw the
girl looking at it. &ldquo;The walls are wet all the time. Comes up
from the cellar. The creek overflows and runs into the basement.
They call this the &lsquo;death-room.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Death! Carmen shuddered when she looked about this
fearful human habitation. Yet, &ldquo;The only death to be feared,&rdquo;
said Paracelsus, &ldquo;is unconsciousness of God.&rdquo; Was this impoverished
woman, then, any less truly alive than the rich
owner of the mills which had robbed her of the means of existence?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_154' name='book4_page_154'></a>154</span>
And can a civilization be alive to the Christ when it
breeds these antipodal types?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, who permits them?&rdquo; Haynerd had once exclaimed.
&ldquo;Ames&rsquo;s methods are the epitome of hell! But he is ours, and
the worthy offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.
We alone are to blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds
executives, and that he buys legislatures! We let him make
the laws, and fatten upon the prey he takes within their limits.
Aye, he is the crafty, vicious, gold-imbruted manifestation of
a whole nation&rsquo;s greed!&rdquo; Nay, more, he is the externalization
of a people&rsquo;s ignorance of God.</p>
<p>Carmen&rsquo;s throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling
about the wretched room and making a feeble attempt at
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the widow went on, happy in the possession of
an auditor, &ldquo;there is no use making apologies for the looks of
my room; I couldn&rsquo;t make it look much better if I tried. There&rsquo;s
no running water. We have to get water from the hydrant
down back of the house. It is pumped there from the creek,
and it&rsquo;s a long climb up these stairs when you&rsquo;ve got only one
arm to hold the bucket. And I have to bring my coal up, too.
The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her. The
woman&rsquo;s lot seemed to have touched the depths of human
wretchedness, and yet there burned within her soul a something
that the oppression of human avarice could not extinguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the children, Miss, that I think about,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the
cloth mills in England. I was only six when I went into the mills
there. I worked from seven in the morning until after six at
night. And the air was so bad and we got so tired that we
children used to fall asleep, and the boss used to carry a stick
to whip us to keep us awake. My parents died when I was
only eight. They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and died
of lead poisoning. People only last four or five years at that
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose. &ldquo;How many children are employed in these
mills here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Miss. But hundreds of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see them,&rdquo; said the girl, and there was a hitch in
her voice as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go down and watch them come out about six this
evening. It&rsquo;s a sight to a stranger. But now I must hurry to
look after the Hoolan babes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she again reached the street Carmen turned and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_155' name='book4_page_155'></a>155</span>
looked up at the hideous structure from which she had
emerged; then she drew a long breath. The foul air of the
&ldquo;death-room&rdquo; seemed to fill her lungs as with leaden weights.
The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel hung like a
veil before her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie lives a block down the street,&rdquo; said the widow, pointing
in the direction. &ldquo;She was burned out last winter. These
tenements don&rsquo;t have fire-escapes, and the one she lived in
burned to the ground in an hour. She lived on the second floor,
and got out. But&ndash;&ndash;six were burned to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the
carnal mind&rsquo;s chamber of horrors was externalized there in the
little town of Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people
too ignorant, too imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values
of life to rise and destroy it.</p>
<p>All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to
door. There was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes,
scowls, and menacing glances. In humble homes and
wretched hovels; to Magyar, Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian,
Irish and Portuguese; and to the angry, the defiant, the
sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her simple banner of love,
the boundless love that discriminates not, the love that sees not
things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart that lie behind
them. And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered hearts
opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew. She knew their languages;
and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to
her. She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they
molded; and that knowledge fell like the sun&rsquo;s bright rays
upon them. She knew God, their God and hers; and that
knowledge began, even on that dull, gray afternoon, to cut into
the chains of human rapacity which enslaved them.</p>
<p>At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill
yard. Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand. A
single electric lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow
light upon the snow. The great, roaring mills were ablaze with
thousands of glittering eyes. Suddenly their monster sirens
shrieked, a blood-curdling yell. Then their huge mouths
opened, and a human flood belched forth.</p>
<p>Carmen gazed with riveted sight. They were not the image
and likeness of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes
of the Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor
Jurges. They were not alive, these stooping, shuffling things,
despite the fact that the religiously contented Patterson Moore
would argue that God had breathed the spirit of life into the
thing of dust which He created. And these children, drifting
past in a great, surging throng! Fathers and mothers of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_156' name='book4_page_156'></a>156</span>
generation to come! Carmen knew that many of them, despite
their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old. These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast,
waxed gross! Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
<i>Cossack</i>!</p>
<p>She turned away in silence. Yes, she was right, evil can
<i>not</i> be really known. There is no principle by which to explain
the hideous things of the human mind. And then she wondered
what the Reverend Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable
salary of ten thousand a year in his rich New York church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a sight, ain&rsquo;t it, Miss?&rdquo; said a voice close by.</p>
<p>Carmen turned and confronted a priest. He was a man of
medium height, young, and of Irish descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great sight,&rdquo; he continued, with a touch of brogue in
his tones. &ldquo;Hey, Fagin!&rdquo; he cried, catching a passing workman&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t worked to-day, Father,&rdquo; replied the man, stopping
and touching his cap.</p>
<p>The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.
Then, as the workman started away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin? And bring everybody
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt,
then passed on into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s trying to reach a few of &rsquo;em I am,&rdquo; remarked the
priest. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s slow work. When a man&rsquo;s stomach&rsquo;s empty
he hasn&rsquo;t much respect for morality. And I can&rsquo;t feed the lot
of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and
wondered. &ldquo;How are you reaching them?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I am
very much interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest returned the girl&rsquo;s searching look. &ldquo;In settlement
work?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;but I am interested in my fellow-beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you&rsquo;ll understand. I&rsquo;ve some rooms, some on
Main street, which I call the Hall, and some down in the&ndash;&ndash;well,
the bad district, which I call the Mission. They&rsquo;re reading
rooms, places for men to meet, and get acquainted, and rest,
and talk. The Hall&rsquo;s for the fellows who work, like this Fagin.
The Mission&rsquo;s for the down-and-outs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;are your rooms only for&ndash;&ndash;for men of your faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a bit!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest with a little laugh. &ldquo;Race
or religion don&rsquo;t figure. It&rsquo;s to give help to every man that
needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are giving your life to help these people?&rdquo; the girl
went on. &ldquo;I want to see your Hall and Mission. Take me to
them,&rdquo; she abruptly demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_157' name='book4_page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>The priest gave a start of surprise. He looked down at
little Tony, and then up at Carmen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We will leave the boy at his door, and
then go to your Mission and Hall. Now tell me, you are a
Roman Catholic priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said mechanically, following her as she started
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to get into this sort of work?&rdquo; she
pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been at it these ten years!&rdquo; he returned, now recovered
from his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d had some experience in New York in the Bowery district.
I came to the conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs
who couldn&rsquo;t be set upon their pins again, given half a
chance by any one sufficiently interested. There&rsquo;s the point.
You see, Miss, I believe in my fellow-men. The results have
justified my labors. Oh, it&rsquo;s only temporary, I know. It ain&rsquo;t
going to change the whole social system. It&rsquo;s a makeshift.
But it helps a bit&ndash;&ndash;and I like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued more seriously, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s going to be
trouble here. A strike is coming. And it&rsquo;s going to be a bad
one. I wish I could convince Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written him several times of late. It doesn&rsquo;t do any
good. His secretary writes back that Mr. Ames is doing all he
can. But it&rsquo;s not much I see he&rsquo;s doing, except to go on sucking
the blood from these poor devils down here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen
asked the priest to go up with her. He raised a hand and
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the good woman doesn&rsquo;t like priests. And
my labors don&rsquo;t reach the women anyway, except through the
men. They constitute my field. Some one else must work
among the women. I&rsquo;ll wait for you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only by making many promises that Carmen could
at last get away from the little group on the fourth floor. But
she slipped a bill into Tony&rsquo;s hands as she went out, and then
hurriedly crossed the hall and opened the unlocked door of
the widow Marcus&rsquo;s room. The place was empty. Carmen
pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the
street below, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t right to take you to the Mission&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go there first,&rdquo; the girl calmly announced. &ldquo;And
then to the Hall. By the way, there&rsquo;s a telephone in your place?
I want to call up the health officer. I want to report the condition
of these tenements.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_158' name='book4_page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>The priest laughed. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good, Miss. I&rsquo;ve
camped on his heels for months. And he can&rsquo;t do anything,
anyway. I see that. If he gets too troublesome to those higher
up, why, he gets fired. They don&rsquo;t want his reports. He isn&rsquo;t
here to report on conditions, but to overlook &rsquo;em. It&rsquo;s politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to
those awful buildings which Mr. Ames owns and rents to his
mill hands?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s criminal to let such buildings
stand. But Ames owns &rsquo;em. That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on in silence for some minutes. Meanwhile, the
priest was studying his fair companion, and wondering who
she might be. At length he inquired if she had ever been in
Avon before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I wish I had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen Pillette&rsquo;s house then? He&rsquo;s resident manager
of the Ames mills. We can go a little out of our way and
have a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager&rsquo;s
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among
ancient trees in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by
shrubs and bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine place, eh?&rdquo; remarked the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;Does he know all about
those tenements down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that he does; and cares less. And he knows all about
the terrible hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs
the lungs of the babies working there. He sees them leave the
place, dripping with perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature
half naked. And when they go off with pneumonia,
well he knows why; and cares less. He knows that the poor,
tired workers in that great prison lose their senses in the awful
noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and fall afoul
of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives. He knows; and
doesn&rsquo;t care. So does Mr. Ames. And he wouldn&rsquo;t put safety
devices over his machines, because he doesn&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ve written
to him a dozen times about it. But&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Pillette,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked him to furnish
his hands with decent drinking water. They work ten
and twelve hours in that inferno, and when they want to drink,
why, all they have is a barrel of warm water, so covered with
lint that it has to be pushed aside in order to get at the water.
Why, Pillette don&rsquo;t even give &rsquo;em change rooms! He won&rsquo;t give
&rsquo;em decent toilet rooms! Says Mr. Ames can&rsquo;t afford it. Seems
to me that when a man can give a ball and send out invitations
on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a thought to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_159' name='book4_page_159'></a>159</span>
thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to enable him
to give such a ball, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen did. She had attended that reception. The memory
came back now in hot, searing thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he catches &rsquo;em coming and going!&rdquo; the priest went on.
&ldquo;You see, he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is
passed, protecting him from imported goods. Then he runs up
the prices of his output. That hits his mill hands, for they
have to pay the higher prices that the tariff causes. Oh, no,
it doesn&rsquo;t result in increased wages to them. Ha! ha! Not a
bit! They&rsquo;re squeezed both ways. He is the only one who
profits by high tariff on cotton goods. See how it works?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Carmen saw. She might not know that Ames periodically
appeared before Congress and begged its protection&ndash;&ndash;nay,
threatened, and then demanded. She might not know that
Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the great man&rsquo;s hand, and
speciously represented to his dignified colleagues that the
benefits of high protective duties were for &ldquo;the people&rdquo; of the
United States. She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed
and bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated,
that his owner might batten on his blood-stained
profits, while he kept his face turned away from the scenes of
carnage, and his ears stopped against the piteous cries of his
driven slaves. But she did know how needless it all was, and
how easy, oh! how pitiably easy, it would be to remedy every
such condition, would the master but yield but a modicum of
his colossal, mesmeric selfishness. She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his
mills of more than two hundred per cent. But she did know
that, were he less stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking
but a hundred per cent profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine
into hundreds of sick, despairing, dying souls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; she heard the priest say, his voice
seeming to come from a long distance. &ldquo;This is the Mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped and looked about her. They were in front of
an old, two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well
lighted. While she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade
her enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This down here is the reading room,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The
door is never locked. Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms
for men. Also a stock of old clothes I keep on hand for &rsquo;em
when I send &rsquo;em out to look for work. I&rsquo;ve clothed an average
of four men a day during the past year, and sent &rsquo;em out to
look for jobs. I board &rsquo;em, and keep &rsquo;em going until they land
something. Sometimes I have to lend &rsquo;em money. I just help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_160' name='book4_page_160'></a>160</span>
&rsquo;em to help themselves. No, I never bother about a man&rsquo;s religion.
Come up to my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered
the small but well-kept office of the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here,&rdquo; he said, with a touch of pride, &ldquo;is my card-index.
I keep tab on all who come here. When they get
straightened up and go out to hunt work, I give &rsquo;em identification
cards. Just as soon as I can get funds I&rsquo;m going to put a
billiard table back there and fit up a little chapel, so&rsquo;s the Catholic
men who drift in here can attend service. You know, a lot
of &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t have the nerve to go to a church. Too proud. But
they&rsquo;d attend Mass here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen looked at the man in admiration. Then a thought
came to her. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t either of us asked the other&rsquo;s name,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dying to know
yours,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Father Magee, Daniel Magee. But
the boys generally call me Danny. What shall I call you? Oh,
give any name; it doesn&rsquo;t matter, just so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll know how to
address you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Carmen Ariza. And I am from South America,&rdquo; said
the girl simply. &ldquo;Now sit down here. I want to talk to you. I
have a lot to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>An hour later the girl rose from her chair. &ldquo;I shall have to
wait and visit the Hall another time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must catch
the eight-thirty back to the city. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never see you go down this tough street to the depot
alone!&rdquo; averred the priest, reaching for his hat.</p>
<p>Carmen laughed. But she gratefully accepted the proffered
escort. Two of Father Magee&rsquo;s assistants had come in
meanwhile, and were caring for the few applicants below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; the priest said, as they started
for the train. &ldquo;Mr. Ames <i>must</i> be reached. Perhaps you can
do it. I can&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;ll give you every assistance possible. It
eats my heart out to see the suffering of these poor people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock that night Carmen entered the office of the
city editor of the Express. &ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with
Dante&ndash;&ndash;no, Danny&ndash;&ndash;in Inferno. Now I&rsquo;m going to Washington.
I want expense money&ndash;&ndash;a good lot&ndash;&ndash;so that I can leave to-morrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd&rsquo;s eyes dilated as he stared at the girl. &ldquo;Washington!&rdquo;
he ejaculated. &ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;! But what did you find down in
Avon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow. I&rsquo;m
going home now,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>
</div>
<p>It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom
in this great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that
Washington is something more significant to him than what
is embraced in the definition of the gazetteers. Not so, however,
of that class of the genus <i>homo</i> individualized in J. Wilton
Ames. He leaned not upon such frail dependence as the <i>Congressional
Record</i> for tempered reports of what goes on behind
closed legislative doors; he went behind those doors himself.
He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to the law-builders
whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts. But,
since the interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important
than their framing, he first applied himself to the
selection of judges, and especially those of the federal courts.
With these safely seated and instructed at home, he gave himself
comfortably to the task of holding his legislators in Washington
to the course he chose.</p>
<p>Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance
of this fact to the common citizen swept over her like
a tidal wave. If the people, those upon whom the stability of
the nation rests, looked as carefully after appointments and
elections as did Ames, would their present wrongs continue
long to endure? She thought not. And after she had spent
the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr. Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the
Capital, she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of
human inertia and its baneful effects upon mankind than she
had known before.</p>
<p>And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation&rsquo;s legislative halls, she sat down
upon a bench in the shadow of the Capitol&rsquo;s great dome and
asked herself the questions: &ldquo;What am I here for, anyway?
What can <i>I</i> do? Why have I come?&rdquo; She had acted upon&ndash;&ndash;impulse?
No; rather, upon instinct. And instinct with her,
as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon her own
thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.</p>
<p>At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival
in the city, Mr. Sands handed her a copy of the Express. Among
the editorials was her full report upon conditions as she had
found them in Avon, published without her signature. Following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_162' name='book4_page_162'></a>162</span>
it was the editor&rsquo;s comment, merciless in its exposition of
fact, and ruthless in its exposure of the cruel greed externalized
in the great cotton industry in that little town.</p>
<p>Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting. Hitt
had said he would be wise in whatever use he made of her
findings. But, though quite devoid of malignity, this account
and its added comment were nothing less than a personal attack
upon the master spinner, Ames. And she had sent another
report from Washington last night, one comprising all
she had learned from Mr. Sands. What would Hitt do with
that? She must get in touch with him at once. So she set
out to find a telegraph office, that she might check the impulsive
publisher who was openly hurling his challenge at the
giant Philistine.</p>
<p>When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject
from her thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm
of the glorious morning and her beautiful environment. For
some time she wandered aimlessly about the city; then bent
her steps again toward the Capitol.</p>
<p>At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and
lovingly at the gorgeous display within. In the midst of the
beautiful profusion a single flower held her attention. It was
a great, brilliant red rose, a kind that she had never seen before.
She went in and asked for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call it the &lsquo;President&rsquo; rose, Miss,&rdquo; said the salesman in
response to her query. &ldquo;It is quite new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want it,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>And when she went out with the splendid flower burning
on her bosom like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not
been there to see her pay two dollars for it.</p>
<p>The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before
it a few moments later. The spell of tradition enwrapped
her. The mighty sentiments and motives which had actuated
the framers of the Constitution seemed to loom before her like
monuments of eternal stone. Had statesmanship degenerated
from that day of pure patriotism into mere corruption? Mr.
Sands would have her so believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people!&rdquo; he had exclaimed in scoffing tones. &ldquo;Why,
my dear girl, the people of your great State are represented in
the national Senate by&ndash;&ndash;whom? By nobody, I say. By the
flies on the panes; by the mice in the corners; by the god,
perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his ineffectual prayers;
but not by men. No; one of your Senators represents a great
railroad; the other an express company! The people? Those
Senators know no such ridiculous creature as &lsquo;the people&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_163' name='book4_page_163'></a>163</span>
strolled in the brilliant sunlight. &ldquo;An economic disease,&rdquo; she
murmured at length. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is. And, like all disease,
it is mental. It is a disease of the human conscience. It
comes from the fear of separation from good. It all reduces to
the belief of separation from God&ndash;&ndash;the belief that upon men&rsquo;s
own human efforts depend all the happiness and satisfaction
they can have. Why, I have never known anything but happiness
and abundance! And yet, <i>I have never made a single effort
to acquire them</i>!&rdquo; For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes
of her life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not
the sun of her joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; cried a loud voice close to her.</p>
<p>There was a tramping of horses&rsquo; feet. A great, dark body
swept past. It struck her, and brushed her to one side. She
strove to hold herself, but fell.</p>
<p>The man and his companion were off their horses instantly,
and assisted the girl to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked the one who had been riding ahead.
&ldquo;I called to you, but you didn&rsquo;t seem to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit!&rdquo; laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and
stooping to brush the dust from her dress. &ldquo;I was dreaming,
as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that! It was a close shave! I&rsquo;m
mighty sorry! Are you sure you&rsquo;re all right? Perhaps you
had better come in with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a
bright smile. The man&rsquo;s anxious expression slowly changed
into one of wonder, and then of something quite different. The
girl&rsquo;s long, thick hair had been loosened by the fall, and was
hanging about her shoulders. Framed in the deep brown profusion
was the fairest face he had ever looked upon; the most
winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come in now, and let the maid help you,&rdquo; he
said firmly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll send you home in an auto. May I ask
where you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York,&rdquo; replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled
vainly with her hair. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to fuss with it any
more!&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go with you, and
let the maid do it up. Isn&rsquo;t it long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward
which the men had been riding. A flush suddenly spread over
her face, and she turned and looked searchingly at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;live&ndash;&ndash;in&ndash;&ndash;there?&rdquo; she stammered, pointing toward
the distant house. &ldquo;And you are&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently
greatly enjoying her embarrassment, &ldquo;I am the President.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_164' name='book4_page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>Carmen gave a little gasp. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon
her bosom. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess I know why I bought this now,&rdquo; she
said softly. Quickly unpinning it, she extended it to the man.
&ldquo;I was bringing it to you, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;President&rsquo; rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist:
the simple girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face,
standing there in the glorious sunlight, holding out a single
rose to the chief executive of a great nation.</p>
<p>The President bowed low and took the proffered flower. &ldquo;I
thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is beautiful. But the one who gives
it is far more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the
stable, and motioned to Carmen to accompany him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just returning from my morning ride,&rdquo; he began
again, &ldquo;when you happened&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things <i>never</i> happen,&rdquo; interrupted the girl gently.</p>
<p>He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance. &ldquo;Then
you didn&rsquo;t happen to be in the way?&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned gravely. &ldquo;I was obeying the law of
cause and effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the cause?&rdquo; he pursued, much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A desire to see you, I guess. Or, perhaps, the <i>necessity</i> of
seeing you. And because I wanted to see you in the interests of
good, why, evil seemed to try to run over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you wish to see me?&rdquo; he continued, greatly
wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are the head of a wonderful nation. Your
influence is very great. And you are a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied her for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came down from New York to talk with me?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I came all the way from South America to see
you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;South America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colombia! There is a revolution in progress down there
now. Did you come to see me about that? I can do nothing&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s to prevent a
revolution here in your own country that I think I have come to
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.
Entering, the President summoned a maid, and turned
the big-eyed girl over to her. &ldquo;Bring her to my office,&rdquo; he
directed, &ldquo;when she is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_165' name='book4_page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>A little later the nameless girl from Simit&iacute; again stood before
the President of the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an important conference at ten,&rdquo; he said, glancing
at a clock. &ldquo;But we have a few minutes before that time. Will
you&ndash;&ndash;may I ask you to tell me something about yourself?&rdquo; he
ventured. &ldquo;You are feeling all right? No bad effects from the
accident?&rdquo; he added, looking apprehensively at her while he set
out a chair.</p>
<p>The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down. &ldquo;I
know nothing about accidents,&rdquo; she said quietly. Then, turning
quite from that topic, she drew the President quickly into
her thought and carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.</p>
<p>The man listened in rapt attention. From time to time he
turned and stared at his strange visitor. At other times he
made notes of points which impressed him. Once he interrupted,
when she made reference to her past life. &ldquo;This priest,
Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, might he not have been imprisoned as a political
offender?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; the girl replied tenderly. &ldquo;My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which
I have received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on. Soon
she was deep in the problem presented by Avon.</p>
<p>But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating
genius, the President seemed to become nervous. At length he
raised a hand, as if to end the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I can do nothing at present,&rdquo; he said with an air of
helplessness. &ldquo;My influence is quite limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;you have the public welfare at heart.
And can you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each
individual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mr. Ames well,&rdquo; the President replied, somewhat
irrelevantly. &ldquo;He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious
problem, doubtless. But he himself, likewise, is confronted
by problems of very trying natures. We must give him time to
work them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like getting at the essence of Christianity,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;The world has had nearly two thousand
years in which to do that, but it hasn&rsquo;t made much of a start
as yet. How much time does Mr. Ames require? And how
many more lives must he sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; the President resumed reflectively, &ldquo;after all, it is
the people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which
exist among them. They have the means of remedying every
economic situation, the ballot. It is really all in their hands,
is it not? They elect their public officers, their judges, and
their lawmakers.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_166' name='book4_page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>Again the girl sighed. &ldquo;You too,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take refuge in
the cant of the age. Yes, the people do try to elect public
servants; but by some strange anomaly the servant becomes
master the moment he enters the door of office. His thought
then centers upon himself. And then they, and you, sit helplessly
back and cry, No use! And if the people rise, their
servants meet them with a hail of lead. It&rsquo;s really childishly
ridiculous, isn&rsquo;t it? when you stop to consider it seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in
her hands, looking squarely into the eyes of the President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter
helplessness,&rdquo; she slowly said. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant entered at that moment with a card. The President
glanced at it, and bade him request the caller to wait a
few moments. Then, after some reflection:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people will always&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly
thrown open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a
huge bulk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr. President,&rdquo;
said the ungracious voice. &ldquo;My appointment was for ten
o&rsquo;clock, and I am here to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement
at the young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon
the desk, and her face close to that of the President.</p>
<p>The latter rose, flushed and angry. But Ames did not notice
him. His attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking
calmly up at him. A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy
eyebrows together, and made the sinister look which mantled
his face one of ominous import to the person upon whom it
fell.</p>
<p>Carmen was the first to break the tense silence. With a
bright smile illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to
the giant before her. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We meet pretty often, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.
Turning upon the President, he said sharply: &ldquo;So, the Express
seeks aid in the White House, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; said Carmen quickly, answering for the
President. &ldquo;It seeks to aid the White House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames turned to the girl. &ldquo;Might I ask,&rdquo; he said in a tone
of mordant sarcasm, &ldquo;how you learned that I was to be here
this morning? I would like to employ your methods of espionage
in my own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give anything if you <i>would</i> employ my methods
in your business,&rdquo; returned the girl gently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_167' name='book4_page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>The President looked in embarrassment from one to the
other. &ldquo;I think, Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we must consider
our interview ended. This next hour belongs by appointment
to Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peculiar expression had come into Ames&rsquo;s features. His
thought had been working rapidly. Here was an opportunity
for a telling stroke. He would play it. His manner suddenly
became more gracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her remain, Mr. President,&rdquo; he said in a tone pregnant
with meaning. &ldquo;I am glad to have a representative of the New
York press with us to hear you express your attitude toward
the cotton schedule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President caught the insinuation. His hand was to be
forced! His indignation mounted, but he checked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The schedule has been reported out of committee,&rdquo; he
replied briefly. &ldquo;It is now before Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware of that,&rdquo; said Ames. &ldquo;And your influence
with Congress in regard to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am studying the matter, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; returned the President
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision? Or,
on the assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule,
must the Spinners&rsquo; Association begin immediate retrenchment?
As president of that Association, I ask for instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr. Ames,
is quite limited,&rdquo; replied the hectored executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a question of the <i>amount</i> of your influence with
that body, Mr. President,&rdquo; returned Ames coldly, &ldquo;but of how
you will employ that which you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence lay upon them all for some moments. Then Ames
resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would remind you,&rdquo; he remarked with cruel insinuation,
&ldquo;that&ndash;&ndash;or,&rdquo; glancing at the girl, &ldquo;perhaps I should not make
this public.&rdquo; He paused and awaited the effect of his significant
words upon the President. Then, as the latter remained
silent, he went on evenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election. Of
course we are saying nothing that the press might use, but&ndash;&ndash;well,
you must realize that there is some suspicion current as
to the exact manner in which your election was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to
the Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to
your very generous campaign contributions, do you not? I
see no reason for withholding from the press your views on the
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_168' name='book4_page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of
suspicion toward all public officials. And such rumors
wouldn&rsquo;t look well on the front pages of the press throughout
the country. Of course, our young friend here isn&rsquo;t going to
mention them to her superiors; but, nevertheless, they ought to
be suppressed at once. Their effect upon your second-term
prospects would be simply annihilating. Now I am in a position
to greatly assist in the matter of&ndash;&ndash;well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express. And I stand ready
now to join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking
to embarrass the present administration. Miss Carmen is
with us&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; the girl quietly interrupted, &ldquo;I wish <i>you</i> were
with <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear girl, have I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For then there would be no more suffering in Avon,&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in
the Express, eh? I might have known it! May I ask,&rdquo; he
added with a contemptuous sneer, &ldquo;by whose authority you
have visited the houses occupied by my tenants, without my
permission or knowledge? I take it you were down there,
although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice, &ldquo;I have been there.
And it was <i>very</i> cloudy. Yes, I visited your charnel houses
and your cemeteries. I saw your victims. I held their trembling
hands, and stroked their hot brows. I fed them, and
gave them the promise that I would plead their cause with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! But you first come here to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington,
Mr. Ames. If I cross your path often, it must be for
a purpose not yet revealed to either of us. Perhaps it is to
warn you, to awaken you, if not too late, to a sense of your
desperate state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My desperate state!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed. And
such continuous drunkenness has made you sick unto death.
It is the same dread disease of the soul that the wicked Cortez
told the bewildered Mexicans he had, and that could be cured
only with gold. You&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t see, Mr. Ames, that you are
mesmerized by the evil which is always using you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up
into his face. He remained for a moment motionless, yielding
again to that fascination which always held him when in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_169' name='book4_page_169'></a>169</span>
presence, and of which he could give no account to himself.
That slight, girlish figure&ndash;&ndash;how easily he could crush her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you couldn&rsquo;t, you know,&rdquo; she said cryptically, as she
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crush me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the
girl had read his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;what a craven error
is before truth. It makes a coward of you, doesn&rsquo;t it? Your
boasted power is only a mesmerism, which you throw like a
huge net over your victims. You and they can break it, if you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen!&rdquo; exclaimed the President. &ldquo;We really must
consider our interview ended. Let us make an appointment
for another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the appointment was made for to-day,&rdquo; the girl
said softly. &ldquo;And by a higher power than any of us. Mr.
Ames is the type of man who is slowly turning our Republican
form of government into a despotism of wealth. He boasts
that his power is already greater than a czar&rsquo;s. You bow before
it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on unhampered,
coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t
see how you, the head of this great nation, can stand trembling
by and see him do it. It is to me incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President flushed. He made as if to reply, but restrained
himself. Carmen gave no indication of leaving. A
stern look then came into the President&rsquo;s face. He stood for a
few minutes in thought. Then he turned again to his desk
and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please be seated,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;both of you. I don&rsquo;t know
what quarrel there is between you two, and I am not interested
in it. But you, Miss Carmen, represent the press; Mr. Ames,
business. The things which have been voiced here this morning
must remain with us alone. Now let us see if we can not
meet on common ground. Is the attitude of your newspaper,
Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express raises its voice only against the folly and
wickedness of the human mind, not against personality,&rdquo; replied
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are attacking Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We attack only the human thought which manifests
in him. We oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself
in the folly, the madness of strife for excessive wealth. It is
that strife that makes our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_170' name='book4_page_170'></a>170</span>
necessity. It makes the immigrant hordes of Europe flock here
because they are attracted by the horrible social system which
fosters the growth of great fortunes and makes their acquisition
possible. Our alms-houses and prisons increase in number
every year. It is because rich men misuse their wealth,
trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation&rsquo;s
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rich need not do that. They do not all&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a law of human thought,&rdquo; said Carmen in reply, &ldquo;that
mankind in time become like that which has absorbed their
attention. Rich men obey this law with utmost precision.
They acquire the nature and character of their god, gold.
They rapidly grow to be like that which they blindly worship.
They harden like their money. They grow metallic, yellow,
calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins they heap
up. There is the great danger to our country, Mr. President.
And it is against the human thought that produces such beings&ndash;&ndash;thought
stamped with the dollar mark&ndash;&ndash;that the Express
opposes itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames. Then
she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic
thought. Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold. Their
arteries harden. And then, at last, they crumble and sink into
the dust of which their god is made. And still their memories
continue to poison the very sources of our national existence.
You see,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;there is no fool so mired in his folly
as the man who gives his soul for great wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit,
Miss Carmen,&rdquo; interposed Ames, bowing to her. &ldquo;And now if
you have finished excoriating my poor character,&rdquo; he continued
dryly, &ldquo;will you kindly state by whose authority you
publish to the world my affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s authority, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; returned the girl gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make
us all suffer!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a gesture of disgust. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t
we better sing a hymn now? You&rsquo;re obsessed with your foolish
religious notions! You&rsquo;re running amuck! You&rsquo;ll be wiser in
a few years, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl reflected. &ldquo;And may I ask, Mr. Ames, by what
right you own mines, and forests, and lands? Divine right, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the divine right of law, most assuredly,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you make the law. Yes, divine right! I have learned,&rdquo;
she continued, turning to the President, &ldquo;that a bare handful
of men own or control all the public utilities of this great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_171' name='book4_page_171'></a>171</span>
country. It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible! But,&rdquo; abruptly, &ldquo;you believe
in God, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.
His religion labored heavily under political bias.</p>
<p>She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while.
&ldquo;Divine right,&rdquo; she began to murmur, &ldquo;the fetish of the
creatures made rich by our man-made social system! &lsquo;The
heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world
and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them.&rsquo; But, oh,
what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a God who
bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!
What a low order of intelligence the rich possess! An intelligence
wherein the sentiments of love and justice have melted
into money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; put in Ames at this juncture, &ldquo;I think
we have spent quite enough time moralizing. Suppose you
now indicate your attitude on the cotton tariff. I&rsquo;d like to
know what to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen glanced quickly up. Her sparkling eyes looked
right into the President&rsquo;s. A smile wreathed her mouth. &ldquo;I
admire the man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who dares to stand for the right
in the face of the great taboo! There are few men nowadays
who stand for anything in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made
a mistake in permitting the girl to remain, &ldquo;I wish my interview
to be with you alone, Mr. President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose. &ldquo;I have embarrassed you both, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I will go. But first&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;I wish&ndash;&ndash;I
wish I might awaken you,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;There is no victim
at Avon in so desperate a state as you. More gold will not
cure you, any more than more liquor can cure a slave to strong
drink. You do not know that you are hourly practicing the
most despicable form of robbery, the wringing of profits which
you do not need out of the dire necessities of your fellow-beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man. His
emotions were in a whirl. This girl always dissected his soul
with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing
you and them that righteousness makes not for a home in
the skies, but for greater happiness and prosperity for everybody
right here in this world. Don&rsquo;t you really want the little
babies to have enough to eat down there at Avon? Do you
really want the President to support you in the matter of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_172' name='book4_page_172'></a>172</span>
cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and sorrow at your
mills? You don&rsquo;t know, do you? that one&rsquo;s greatest happiness
is found only in that of others.&rdquo; She stood looking at him for
a few moments, then turned away.</p>
<p>The President rose and held out his hand to her. She
almost laughed as she took it, and her eyes shone with the
light of her eager, unselfish desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess I&rsquo;m like Paul,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;consumed with zeal.
Anyway, you&rsquo;ll wear my rose, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will!&rdquo; he said heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are
you? As for party principle, why, you know, there is only <i>one</i>
principle, God. He is the Christ-principle, you know, and that
is way above party principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the spell of the girl&rsquo;s strange words every emotion
fled from the men but that of amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking. And that
touches just that about which men are most chary, their
pocketbooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still held his hand. Then she arched her brows and
said na&iuml;vely: &ldquo;You will find in yesterday&rsquo;s Express something
about Avon. You will not use your influence with Congress
until you have read it, will you?&rdquo; And with that she left the
room.</p>
<p>A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive
and the great apostle of privilege. It seemed to the one that as
the door closed against that bright presence the spirit of night
descended; the other sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting
emotions in which she always left him.</p>
<p>Suddenly the President roused up. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the bastard daughter of a negro priest,&rdquo; replied Ames
in an ugly tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&ndash;&ndash;she? That beautiful girl&ndash;&ndash;! I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, she is!&rdquo; cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing
a huge fist down hard upon the desk. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got the
proof! And, what&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;s head over heels in love with
another renegade priest!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; he continued savagely.
&ldquo;I want to know what you are going to do for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I do not see, Mr. Ames, that I can do anything,&rdquo; replied
the President meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell
you then?&rdquo; the financier pursued, taking another tack.</p>
<p>The President hesitated. Then he raised his head. &ldquo;You
say you have proof?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_173' name='book4_page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;about the girl, you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the girl!&rdquo; almost shouted Ames. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got proofs
that will ruin her, and you too&ndash;&ndash;and, by God, I&rsquo;ll use &rsquo;em, if
you drive me to it! You seem to forget that you were elected
to do our bidding, my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President again lapsed into silence. For a long time
he sat staring at the floor. Then he looked up. &ldquo;It was wonderful,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;wonderful the way she faced you, like David
before Goliath! There isn&rsquo;t a vestige of fear in her make-up.
I&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll talk this matter over some other time, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he
finished, rising abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over now!&rdquo; roared Ames, his self-control flying
to the winds. &ldquo;I can ruin you&ndash;&ndash;make your administration
a laughing-stock&ndash;&ndash;and plunge this country into financial panic!
Do you do as I say, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes.
&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s corking! Simply corking!&rdquo; cried Haynerd, when he and
Hitt had finished reading Carmen&rsquo;s report on her first few
days in Washington. &ldquo;Makes a fellow feel as if the best
thing Congress could do would be to adjourn for about fifty
years, eh? Such freak legislation! But she&rsquo;s a wonder, Hitt!
And she&rsquo;s booming the Express to the skies! Say, do you
know? she&rsquo;s in love, that girl is! That&rsquo;s why she is so&ndash;&ndash;as the
Mexicans say&ndash;&ndash;<i>simp&aacute;tico</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? In love!&rdquo; exclaimed Hitt. &ldquo;Well, not with you, I
hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, unfortunately,&rdquo; replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected
mien, &ldquo;but with that Rinc&oacute;n fellow&ndash;&ndash;and he a priest! He&rsquo;s
got a son down in Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn&rsquo;t write
to her either. She&rsquo;s told Sid the whole story, and he&rsquo;s working
it up into a book during his odd moments. But, say,&rdquo; turning
the conversation again into its original channel, &ldquo;how much of
her report are we going to run? You know, she tried to head us
off. Doesn&rsquo;t want to attack Ames. Ha! ha! As if she hadn&rsquo;t
already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful in our allusions to the President,&rdquo;
replied Hitt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her
or him. And I&ndash;&ndash;but, by George! her reports are the truth, and
they rightfully belong to the people! The Express is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_174' name='book4_page_174'></a>174</span>
avowed servant of the public! What she finds out belongs to
all. I see no reason for concealing a thing. Did I tell you that
I had two inquiries from Italian and German papers, asking
permission to translate her reports into their own columns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Jerusalem! We&rsquo;re becoming famous! Did you wire
her to see Gossitch and Mall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Logue, as well as others. And I&rsquo;ve put dozens of
senators and congressmen on our mailing list, including the
President himself. I&rsquo;ve prepared letters for each one of them,
calling attention to the girl and her unique reports. She certainly
writes in a fascinating vein, doesn&rsquo;t she? Meanwhile,
she&rsquo;s circulating around down there and advertising us in the
best possible manner. We&rsquo;re a success, old man!&rdquo; he finished,
slapping the city editor roundly upon the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; growled the latter. &ldquo;Confine your enthusiasm
to words, my friend. Say, what did you do about that liquid
food advertisement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discovered that it was beer,&rdquo; replied Hitt, &ldquo;and turned it
firmly down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t beer a food? Not that we care to advertise it,
but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt laughed. &ldquo;When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to
convince me that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff
to the Iles chemical laboratory for analysis. They reported
ninety-four per cent water, four per cent alcohol&ndash;&ndash;defined now
as a poisonous drug&ndash;&ndash;and about two per cent of possible food
substance. If the beer had been of the first grade there
wouldn&rsquo;t have been even the two per cent of solids. You know,
I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of what Carmen said about the beer
that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light. Light, you know, starts decay in
beer. Well, light, according to Fuller, is &lsquo;God&rsquo;s eldest daughter.&rsquo;
Emerson says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing
so foul that intense light will not make it beautiful. Light
destroys fermentation. Thus the light of truth destroys the
fermentation which is supposed to constitute the human mind
and body. So light tries to purify beer by breaking it up. The
brewers have to put it into brown bottles to preserve its poisonous
qualities. As Carmen says, beer simply can&rsquo;t stand the
light. No evil can stand the light. Remarkable, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s astonishing that so many so-called reputable
papers will take their advertising stuff. It&rsquo;s just as bad as
patent medicine ads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I note that the American public still spend their
annual hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope. Most
of this is spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_175' name='book4_page_175'></a>175</span>
trade. I learned of one exposure recently made where
it was found that a widely advertised eye wash was composed
of borax and water. The cost was somewhere about five cents
a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an ounce. Nice little profit of
some two hundred and fifty thousand per cent, and all done
by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising. Shrewd business,
eh? Nice example in morality. Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott
because we won&rsquo;t advertise their lies and delusions. It&rsquo;s
as bad as ecclesiastical intolerance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen spent a week in Washington. Then she returned
to New York and went directly to Avon. What she did there
can only be surmised by a study of her reports to Hitt, who
carefully edited them and ran them in the Express. Again,
after several days, she journeyed back to Washington. Her
enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her industry
ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable. In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom
she deemed essential to the work which she was doing. Doubtless
her ability to do this and to gain an audience with whomsoever
she might choose was in great part due to her beauty
and charming simplicity, her grace of manner, and her wonderful
and fearless innocence, combined with a mentality remarkable
for its matured powers. Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo; growled the latter one day. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had
four different talks with the President! How on earth do you
suppose she does it? And how did she get Mall and Logue to
take her to dinner and to the theater again and again? And
what did she do to induce that doddering old blunderbuss,
Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to? I&rsquo;ll bet he made
love to her! How do you suppose she found out that Ames
was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working
tooth and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?
Say, do you know what that would do? It would foist allopathy
upon every chick and child of us! Make medication,
drugging, compulsory! Good heavens! Have we come to that
in this supposedly free country? By the way, Hitt, Doctor
Morton has been let out of the University. Fired! He says
Ames did it because of his association with us. What do you
think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, my friend,&rdquo; replied Hitt, &ldquo;that it is a very serious
matter, and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every
one of us, when a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run
loose through our streets. Can nothing stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_176' name='book4_page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve centered my hopes in Carmen,&rdquo; sighed Haynerd.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my one last bet. If she can&rsquo;t stop him, then God himself
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt turned and went into his office. A few moments later
he came out again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd.
&ldquo;Some notes she&rsquo;s sent from Washington. Mentions the National
Bureau of Health project. It hasn&rsquo;t escaped her, you
see. Say, will you tell me where she picks up her information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord gives it to her, I guess,&rdquo; said Haynerd, glancing
over the letter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for
the National Bureau of Health bill. Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending an
American ambassador to the Vatican. Mr. Ames favors this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into
the papers on his desk. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say another word to me!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;This country&rsquo;s going stark, staring mad! We&rsquo;re
crazy, every mother&rsquo;s son of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly
without any basis of principle,&rdquo; returned Hitt with a sigh.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Siler! I beg your pardon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Why, Miss Carmen!&rdquo; exclaimed that worthy person,
looking up from the gutter, whither he had hastened after his
silk hat which had been knocked off by the encounter with the
young girl who had rounded the corner of Ninth street into
Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry, Doctor! I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Miss Carmen. It&rsquo;s a privilege to have my
hat knocked off by such a radiant creature as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was so stupid of me! Dreaming again! And I want
to offer my&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest
at luncheon, will you? That will not only make amends, but
place me hopelessly in your debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl heartily. &ldquo;I was on my
way to a restaurant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come with me. I&rsquo;ve got a little place around the
corner here that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing
odes to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.
A few minutes later they were seated at a little table in a
secluded corner of the doctor&rsquo;s favorite chophouse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_177' name='book4_page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago,&rdquo;
announced the doctor, after they had given their orders. &ldquo;He
was coming out of the White House, and&ndash;&ndash;were you ever in a
miniature cyclone? Well, that was Ames! He blew me right
off the sidewalk! So angry, he didn&rsquo;t see me. That&rsquo;s twice
to-day I&rsquo;ve been sent to the gutter!&rdquo; He laughed heartily over
his experiences, then added significantly: &ldquo;You and he are
both mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite
effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen remained seriously thoughtful. The doctor went
on chatting volubly. &ldquo;Ames and the President don&rsquo;t seem to
be pulling together as well as usual. The President has come
out squarely against him now in the matter of the cotton
schedule. Ames declares that the result will be a general financial
panic this fall. By the way, Mr. Sands, the Express correspondent,
seems to be getting mighty close to administration
affairs these days. Where did he get that data regarding a
prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave it to him,&rdquo; was the simple reply.</p>
<p>The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;of course you naturally would be opposed
to it. But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;tell me candidly just what you
doctors are striving for, anyway. For universal health? Are
your activities all quite utilitarian, or&ndash;&ndash;is it money and
monopoly that you are after? It makes a lot of difference, you
know, in one&rsquo;s attitude toward you. If you really seek the
betterment of health, then you are only honestly mistaken in
your zeal. But if you are doing this to make money&ndash;&ndash;and I
think you are&ndash;&ndash;then you are a lot of rascals, deserving defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?&rdquo; He laughed
lightly at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She hesitated. He began to color slightly
under her keen scrutiny. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she finally continued, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
see. If you doctors have made the curative arts effective, and
if you really do heal disease, then I must support you, of course.
But, while there is nothing quite so important to the average
mortal as his health, yet I know that there is hardly anything
that has been dealt with in such a bungling way. The art of
healing as employed by our various schools of medicine to-day
is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and bitter experience,
isn&rsquo;t it? And its cost in human lives is simply incalculable.
No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical,
as the so-called science of medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have had to learn,&rdquo; protested the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize, Doctor,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that the teaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_178' name='book4_page_178'></a>178</span>
and preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest
curses resting upon the world to-day? I never saw a doctor
until I was on the boat coming to New York. And then I
thought he was one of the greatest curiosities I had ever seen.
I followed him about and listened to him talk to the passengers.
And I learned that, like most of our young men, he had entered
the practice of medicine under the pressure of dollars rather
than altruism. Money is still the determining factor in the
choice of a profession by our young men. And success and
fortune in the medical profession, more than in any other,
depend upon the credulity of the ignorant and helpless human
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you deny that great progress has been made in the
curative arts?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;See what we have done with
diphtheria, with typhoid, with smallpox, and malaria!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary
removing of a disease is <i>real</i> healing! You render one
lot of microbes innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation,
and leave mankind subject to the rest. Then you
render another set harmless. Do you expect to go on that way,
making set after set of microbes harmless to the human body,
and thus in time, after millions of years, eradicate disease entirely?
Do you think that people will then cease to die? All
the time you are working only in matter and through material
modes. Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal? I think a sad disappointment awaits you.
Your patients get well, only to fall sick again. And death to
you is still as inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes,
is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated. It suffers
from auto-infection. It makes its own disease microbes. It
will keep on making them, until it is educated out of itself,
and taught to do better. Then it will give place to the real
reflection of divine mind; and human beings will be no more.
Why don&rsquo;t you realize this, you doctors, and get started on the
right track? Your real work is in the <i>mental</i> realm. There
you will find both cause and cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she interposed. &ldquo;Dependence upon material drugs,
Doctor, is reliance upon the <i>phenomena</i> of the human mind.
Faith cure is dependence upon the human mind itself, upon
the <i>noumenon</i>, instead of the <i>phenomenon</i>. Do you see the
difference? Hypnotism is mental suggestion, the suggestions
being human and material, not divine truth. The drugging
system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in matter. Faith
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_179' name='book4_page_179'></a>179</span>
cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the human mind.
One is no higher than the other. The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress
has been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.
The first doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man,
whose remedies reflected his mental status, and later
found apt illustration in the brew concocted by Macbeth&rsquo;s
witches. And think you he has disappeared? Unbelievable as
it may seem, it was only a short time ago that a case was reported
from New York where the skin of a freshly killed black
cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had refused
to yield to the prescribed drugging! And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to
touch a sick child&rsquo;s head with one of the prehistoric stone
axes there exhibited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was mere superstition,&rdquo; retorted the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;But <i>materia medica</i> is superstition
incarnate. And because of the superstition that life and virtue
and power are resident in matter, mankind have swallowed
nearly everything known to material sense, in the hope that
it would cure them of their own auto-infection. You remember
what awful recipes Luther gave for disease, and his exclamation
of gratitude: &lsquo;How great is the mercy of God who has
put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; resumed the doctor, &ldquo;we physicians are
workers, not theorists. We handle conditions as we find them,
not as they ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;You handle conditions
as the human, mortal mind believes them to be, that&rsquo;s
all. You accept its ugly pictures as real, and then you try
desperately through legislation to make us all accept them.
Yet you would bitterly resent it if some religious body should
try to legislate its beliefs upon you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists. Perhaps
it is because, as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into
the human frame your higher and more subtle faculties are
materialized, and you lose the spiritual view of existence.
Your only remedy for diseased matter is more matter. And
these material remedies? Why, ignorance and superstition
have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies in use
by you to-day! And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed,
because the only curative property a drug has is the credulity
of the person who swallows it. And that is a factor which
varies with the individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays,
Miss Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_180' name='book4_page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They are beginning to get away from it, little by little,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors
and patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not
because of the drugs which they have taken, but <i>in spite of
them</i>! One of the most prominent of our contemporary physicians
who are getting away from the use of drugs has said that
eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get well of their own accord,
no matter what may or may not be done for them. In a very
remarkable article from this same doctor&rsquo;s pen, in which he
speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the <i>materia medica</i> rubbish of the ages,
he states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor
has on his hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they
have on the confidence and affections both of the profession
and of the public. Among his illuminating remarks about the
drug system, I found two drastic statements, which should
serve to lift the veil from the eyes of the chronic drug taker.
These are, first, &lsquo;Take away opium and alcohol, and the backbone
of the patent medicine business would be broken inside of
forty-eight hours,&rsquo; and, second, &lsquo;No drug, save quinine and
mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.&rsquo; In words which
he quotes from another prominent physician, &lsquo;He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hundreds of drugs listed in books on <i>materia medica</i>
I find are gradually being reduced in number to a possible
forty or fifty, and one doctor makes the radical statement that
they can be cut down to the &lsquo;six or seven real drugs.&rsquo; Still
further light has been thrown upon the debasing nature of the
drugging system by a member of the Philadelphia Drug Exchange,
in a recent hearing before the House Committee on
municipal affairs right here. He is reported as saying that it
makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon
the faith of the user. The sick man who turns to patent medicines
for relief becomes the victim of &lsquo;bottled faith.&rsquo; If his
faith is sufficiently great, a cure may be effected&ndash;&ndash;and the
treatment has been <i>wholly mental</i>! The question of ethics does
not concern either the patent medicine manufacturer or the
druggist, for they argue that if the sick man&rsquo;s faith has been
aroused to the point of producing a cure, the formula of the
medicine itself is of no consequence, and, therefore, if a solution
of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds can stimulate
the sufferer&rsquo;s faith to the point of meeting his need, the business
is quite legitimate. &lsquo;A bunch of bottles and sentiment,&rsquo;
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, &lsquo;are the real essentials
for working healing miracles.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_181' name='book4_page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding
her with amazement. &ldquo;You have a marvelous memory for
data!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.
I want to help them, and show them how to learn to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;And I am doing all I can, the very
best I know how to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to
do by every vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your
mentality, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said archly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t really
seriously thought out your way, else you would not be here
now urging Congress to spread a blanket of ignorance over the
human mind. If you will reflect seriously, if you will lay
aside monetary considerations, and a little of the hoary prejudice
of the ages, and will carefully investigate our present
medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing
the other of inferiority as an exact science, and as
grossly ignorant and reprehensibly careless of life. But which
of these warring schools can show the greatest number of
cures is a bit of data that has never been ascertained. A recent
writer says: &lsquo;As important as we all realize health to be, the
public is receiving treatment that is anything but scientific,
and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on in
the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.&rsquo; He
further says that, &lsquo;at least seventy-five per cent of the people
we meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some
chronic ailment that regular medical systems can not cure,&rsquo;
and that many of these would try further experimentation were
it not for the criticism that is going on in the medical world
regarding various curative systems. The only hope under the
drugging system is that the patient&rsquo;s life and purse may hold
out under the strain of trying everything until he can light
upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you include surgery in your general criticism?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient
matter than is the drugging system,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is admittedly
necessary in the present stage of the world&rsquo;s thought;
but it is likewise admitted to be &lsquo;the very uncertain art of
performing operations,&rsquo; at least ninety per cent of which are
wholly unnecessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;the effect upon the <i>moral</i> nature
of the sick man is never considered as rightfully having any
influence upon the choice of the system to be employed. If
Beelzebub can cast out demons, why not employ him? For,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_182' name='book4_page_182'></a>182</span>
after all, the end to be attained is the ejection of the demon.
And if God had not intended minerals and plants to be used as
both food and medicine, why did He make them? Besides,
man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists
we may be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by
ourselves. Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining
factor in the choice of a profession, is an influence
that works to keep many in the practice of a profession that
they know to be both unscientific and harmful. The result is
an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of material accumulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You certainly are hard on us poor
doctors! And we have done so much for you, too, despite your
accusations. Think of the babies that are now saved from
diphtheria alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And think of the children who are the victims of the
medical mania!&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Think how they are brought
up under the tyranny of fear! Fear of this and of that; fear
that if they scratch a finger blood poisoning will deprive them
of life; fear that eating a bit of this will cause death; or sitting
in a breeze will result in wasting sickness! Isn&rsquo;t it criminal?
As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the same class as the white
of an egg. It contains no chemicals. It is the result of human
belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered from diphtheria
can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease. The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the
human mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power
in matter, and of disease and death. The microbe will be subject,
therefore, to the human mind&rsquo;s changing thought regarding
it, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;if people are spiritual, and
if they really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem
to be carrying about a body with us all the time&ndash;&ndash;a body from
which we are utterly unable to get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.
The body is a lower stratum of the human mind. Hence, the
so-called mind is never distinct from its body to the extent of
complete separation, but always has its substratum with it.
And, Doctor, the mind can not hold a single thought without
that thought tending to become externalized&ndash;&ndash;as Professor
James tells us&ndash;&ndash;and the externalization generally has to do
with the body, for the mind has come to center all its hopes
of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its sense of
life upon it. The body, being a mental concept formed of false
thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_183' name='book4_page_183'></a>183</span>
upon which to rest. Therefore the sense of life embodied in it
passes away with it. You know, the ancients had some idea
of the cause of disease when they attributed it to demons, for
demons at least are mental influences. But then, after that,
men began to believe that disease was sent by God, either to
punish them for their evil deeds, or to discipline and train them
for paradise. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it? Think of regarding pain and
suffering as divine agents! I don&rsquo;t wonder people die, do you?
Humboldt, you know, said: &lsquo;The time will come when it will
be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the world
will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some vicious
thinking.&rsquo; Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that <i>we think all over</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; put in the doctor. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a question I
intended to ask Hitt the other night. He said the five physical
senses did not testify truly. Well now, if, as you say, the eyes
do not testify to disease, then they can&rsquo;t testify to cures either,
eh?&rdquo; He sat back with an air of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite correct,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;The physical senses
testify only to belief. In the case of sickness, they testify to
false belief. In the case of a cure, they testify to a changed
belief, to a belief of recovered health, that is all. It is all on
the basis of human belief, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? But&ndash;&ndash;nerves feel&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought. Can the externalization of thought talk back to
thought? No. You are still on the basis of mere human belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon
the window to attract the attention of some one in the street.
Carmen looked out and caught sight of a tall, angular man
dressed in clerical garb. The man bowed pleasantly to the
doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the girl, then passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A priest?&rdquo; inquired Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tetham,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the
Capital for his Church? I&rsquo;ve heard about him. He&ndash;&ndash;well, it is
his business to see that members of his Church are promoted
to political office, isn&rsquo;t it? He trades votes of whole districts
to various congressmen in return for offices for strong church
members. He also got the parochial schools of New York exempt
from compulsory vaccination. The Express&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? The Express has heard from him?&rdquo; inquired the
doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We opposed the candidate Mr. Ames was supporting
for Congress. We also supported Mr. Wales in his work on
the cotton schedule. And so we heard from Father Tetham.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_184' name='book4_page_184'></a>184</span>
He is supporting the National Bureau of Health bill. He is
working for the Laetare medal. He&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up
your news? Really, you astonish me! Do you know something
about everybody here in Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I have learned much here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;about
popular government as exemplified by these United States.
The knowledge is a little saddening. But it is especially saddening
to see our constitutional liberties threatened by this
Bureau of Health bill, and by the Government&rsquo;s constant truckling
to the Church of Rome. Doctor, can it be that you want
to commit this nation to the business of practicing medicine,
and to its practice according to the allopathic, or &lsquo;regular&rsquo;
school? The American Medical Association, with its reactionary
policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures
which would result in the creation of such a Department of
Health, the effect of which would be to monopolize the art of
healing and to create a &lsquo;healing trust.&rsquo; If this calamity should
be permitted to come upon the American people, it would fall
as a curtain of ignorance and superstition over our fair land,
and shut out the light of the dawning Sun of Truth. It would
mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the Middle Ages,
in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance and
tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable
rock in the pathway of human progress. The attempt to foist
upon a progressive people a system of medicine and healing
which is wholly unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but
which is admittedly known to be responsible for the death of
millions and for untold suffering and misery, and then to say,
&lsquo;<i>Thou shalt be cured thereby, or not be cured at all</i>,&rsquo; is an insult
to the intelligence of the Fathers of our liberties, and a crime
upon a people striving for the light. It smacks of the Holy
Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you shall go to hell&ndash;&ndash;after
we have broken you on the rack! Why, the thought of
subjecting this people to years of further dosing and experimentation
along the materialistic lines of the &lsquo;regular&rsquo; school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the
yoke of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence
of a clarion call, and startle them into such action that
the subtle evil which lurks behind this proposed legislative
action would be dragged out into the light and exterminated!
To permit commercialism and greed, the lust of mammon, and
the pride of the flesh that expresses itself in the demand, &lsquo;Who
shall be greatest?&rsquo; to dictate the course of conduct that shall
shape the destinies of a great people, is to admit the failure of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_185' name='book4_page_185'></a>185</span>
free government, and to revert to a condition of mind that we
had thought long since outgrown. To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand&ndash;&ndash;well, Doctor,
<i>it is just unthinkable</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.
Yet you have the effect of making me feel as if&ndash;&ndash;as if I were
in some way behind a veil. That&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil&ndash;&ndash;indeed,
behind many of them. And how can it see God through
them? Mankind just grope about all their lives back of these
veils, not knowing that God is right before them all the time.
God has got to be everything, or else He will be nothing. With
or without drugs, it is God &lsquo;who healeth all thy diseases.&rsquo; The
difficulty with physicians is that they are densely ignorant of
what healing means, and so they always start with a dreadful
handicap. They believe that there is something real to be
overcome&ndash;&ndash;and of course fail to permanently overcome it.
Many of them are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the
profession simply to make money out of the fears and credulity
of the people. Doctor, the physician of to-day is in no way
qualified to handle the question of public health&ndash;&ndash;especially
those doctors who say: &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t take our medicines we&rsquo;ll
get a law passed that will make you take them.&rsquo; To place the
health of the people in their hands would be a terrible mistake.
The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based upon
motives of ignorance and intentional wrong. If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it. Make
what laws you wish for yourself, Doctor. The human mind is
constantly occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.
But do not attempt to foist your laws upon the people.
Tell me, why all this agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in
the public schools? Why not, for a change, teach Christianity?
What would be the result? But even the Bible has been put
out of the schools. And by whom? By your Church, that its
interpretation may continue to be falsely made by those utterly
and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments they continued their meal in silence.
Then the girl took up the conversation again. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;will you come out from among them and be separate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her quizzically. &ldquo;Oppose Ames?&rdquo; he finally
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is the rub, then! Yes, oppose ignorance and
falsity, even though incarnate in Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would ruin me!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor. &ldquo;He ruins
everybody who stands in his way! The cotton schedule has
gone against him, and the whole country will have to suffer
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_186' name='book4_page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But how can he make the country suffer because he has
been blocked in his colossal selfishness?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can not answer,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;But I do know
that he has intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this
country next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cotton crop! Why, how can he prevent that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head. &ldquo;Mr. Ames stands as the claim
of omnipotent evil,&rdquo; was his laconic reply.</p>
<p>And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way,
pondering deeply. &ldquo;No cotton crop! What&ndash;&ndash;what did he
mean?&rdquo; But that was something too dark to be reported to the
Express.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen
in the presence of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist,
the master manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington,
and in a dangerous frame of mind. What might have
been his mental state had he known that the train which drew
his private car also brought Carmen back to New York, can
only be conjectured. It was fortunate, no doubt, that both
were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the great
externalization of the human mind&rsquo;s &ldquo;claim&rdquo; of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after righteousness
sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing
away the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.</p>
<p>When the financier&rsquo;s car drew into the station his valets
breathed great sighs of relief, and his French chef and negro
porter mopped the perspiration from their troubled brows,
while silently offering peans of gratitude for safe delivery.
When the surly giant descended the car steps his waiting footman
drew back in alarm, as he caught his master&rsquo;s black looks.
When he threw himself into the limousine, his chauffeur drew
a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in the direction
of the lackey. And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable
and generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Express&ndash;&ndash;I want a libel suit brought against it at
once! Draw it for half a million! File it in Judge Penny&rsquo;s
court!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; responded the lawyer meekly. &ldquo;The grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the grounds!&rdquo; shouted Ames. Then, in a voice
trembling with anger: &ldquo;Have you read the last week&rsquo;s issues?
Then find your grounds in them! Make that girl a defendant
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has no financial interest in the paper, sir. And, as for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_187' name='book4_page_187'></a>187</span>
the reports which they have published&ndash;&ndash;I hardly think we can
establish a case from them&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? With Judge Penny sitting? If you and he can&rsquo;t
make out a case against them, then I&rsquo;ll get a judge and a
lawyer who can! I want that bill filed to-morrow!&rdquo; bringing
his fist down upon the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; assented Hood, stepping back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; continued Ames, &ldquo;see Judge Hanson and
have the calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am
ready for it. I&rsquo;ve got a scheme to involve that negro wench in
the trial, and drag her through the gutters! So, she&rsquo;s still in
love with Rinc&oacute;n, eh? Well, we&rsquo;ll put a crimp in that little
affair, I guess! Has Willett heard from Wenceslas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate
if he tries to trick me! Has Willett found Lafelle&rsquo;s whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spain! What&rsquo;s he&ndash;&ndash;up to there?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a voice
that began high and ended in a whisper.</p>
<p>He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments
his thoughts seemed to wander far. Then he pulled himself
together and roused out of his meditations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent,
provided it would publish the stuff I sent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He was very glad to accept your offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. You and Willett set about at once getting up
daily articles attacking the Express. I want you to dig up
every move ever made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton,
and the whole miserable, sneaking outfit! Rake up every
scandal, every fact, or rumor, that is in any way associated
with any of them. I want them literally cannonaded by the
Budget! Hitt&rsquo;s a renegade preacher! Haynerd was a bum
before he got the Social Era! Waite is an unfrocked priest!
Miss Wall&rsquo;s father was a distiller! That girl&ndash;&ndash;that girl is a&ndash;&ndash;Did
you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the
red-light district? Well, she did! Great record the publishers
of the Express have, eh? Now, by God! I want you and Jayne
to bury that whole outfit under a mountain of mud! I&rsquo;m
ready to spend ten millions to do it! Kill &rsquo;em! Kill &rsquo;em all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can do it, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; returned the lawyer confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to! Now, another matter: I&rsquo;m out to get the
President&rsquo;s scalp! He&rsquo;s got to go down! Begin with those
New York papers which we can influence. I&rsquo;ll get Fallom and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_188' name='book4_page_188'></a>188</span>
Adams over here for a conference. Meanwhile, think over
what we&rsquo;d better say to them. Our attacks upon the President
must begin at once! I&rsquo;ve already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose. They have a few facts now that will
discredit his administration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Ames. Ah&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;there is a matter that I
must mention as soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr. Ames&ndash;&ndash;regarding
Avon. It seems that the reports which that girl has
made have been translated into several languages, and are being
used by labor agitators down there to stir up trouble. The
mill hands, you know, never really understood what your
profits were, and&ndash;&ndash;well, they have always been quite ignorant,
you know, regarding any details of the business. But now
they think they have been enlightened&ndash;&ndash;they think they see
how the tariff has benefited you at their expense&ndash;&ndash;and they are
extremely bitter against you. That priest, Father Danny, has
been doing a lot of talking since the girl was down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking
back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; the lawyer continued, &ldquo;the situation
is fast becoming acute. The mill hands don&rsquo;t believe now that
you were ever justified in shutting down, or putting them on
half time. And, whether you reduce wages or not, they are
going to make very radical demands upon you in the near
future, unless I am misinformed. These demands include
better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours, and
very much higher wages. Also the enforcement of the child
labor law, I am sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo; shouted Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, after all, Mr. Ames, you know you have said that it
would strengthen your case with Congress if there should be
a strike at Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not now! Not now!&rdquo; cried Ames. &ldquo;It would ruin
everything! I am distinctly out of favor with the President&ndash;&ndash;owing
to that little negro wench! And Congress is going
against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and Mall! That girl has
put me in bad down there! Wales is beginning to threaten!
By G&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames, she can be removed, can she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violence would still further injure us. But&ndash;&ndash;if we can
drive the Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit
that girl, either in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then,
with a little show of bettering things at Avon, we&rsquo;ll get what we
want. But we&rsquo;ve got work before us. Say, is&ndash;&ndash;is Sidney with
the Express?&rdquo; he added hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and
curiosity at his master. Was it possible that Ames&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_189' name='book4_page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You heard my question, Mr. Hood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg pardon! Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;Sidney is still with them.
He&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;they say he has quite conquered his&ndash;&ndash;his&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, he&rsquo;s no longer a sot?&rdquo; Ames asked brutally.
&ldquo;Out with it, man! Don&rsquo;t sit there like a smirking Chinese
god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his
habits, and that the&ndash;&ndash;that girl&ndash;&ndash;did it,&rdquo; stammered the nervous
lawyer.</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s mouth jerked open&ndash;&ndash;and then snapped shut. Silence
held him. His head slowly sank until his chin touched his
breast. And as he sat thus enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly
left the room.</p>
<p>Alone sat the man of gold&ndash;&ndash;ah, more alone than even he
knew. Alone with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism,
his watery aims. Alone and plotting the ruin of those who
had dared bid him halt in his mad, destroying career. Alone,
this high priest of the caste of absolutism, of the old individualism
which is fast hurrying into the realm of the forgotten.
Alone, and facing a new century, with whose ideals his own
were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.</p>
<p>Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and
pain of countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of
conditions which he had made too hard for them. Looking,
unmoved, unhearing, upon the bitter struggles of the weak,
the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross hewers of wood and
drawers of water. Looking, and knowing not that in their
piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.</p>
<p>The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief
stenographer of the great bank below. Ames looked up and
silently nodded permission for the man to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; the clerk began, &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have come to ask a
favor&ndash;&ndash;a great favor. I am having difficulty&ndash;&ndash;considerable
difficulty in securing stenographers, but&ndash;&ndash;I may say&ndash;&ndash;my greatest
struggle is with myself. I&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Ames, I can not&ndash;&ndash;I simply
can not continue to hire stenographers at the old wage, nine
dollars a week! I know how these girls are forced to live.
Mr. Ames, with prices where they are now, they can not live
on that! May I not offer them more? Say, ten or twelve
dollars to start with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames looked at him fixedly. &ldquo;Why do you come to me with
your request?&rdquo; he asked coldly. &ldquo;Your superior is Mr. Doan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I know,&rdquo; replied the young man with hesitation.
&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;did speak to him about it, and&ndash;&ndash;he refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing, sir,&rdquo; returned Ames in a voice that chilled
the man&rsquo;s life-current.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_190' name='book4_page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall resign, Mr. Ames! I refuse to remain here
and hire stenographers at that criminal wage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Ames in the same low, freezing
tone. &ldquo;Hand your resignation to Mr. Doan. Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was
left alone. Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought
turned back upon itself, and began the reconstruction of
scenes and events long since shadowy dreams. And always as
they built, the fair face of that young girl appeared in the fabric.
And always as he retraced his course, her path crossed and
crossed again his own. Always as he moved, her reflection fell
upon him&ndash;&ndash;not in shadow, but in a flood of light, exposing the
secret recesses of his sordid soul.</p>
<p>He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those
days, before her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat
about the Beaubien&rsquo;s table and laid their devious snares. It
was only the summer before she came that this same jolly
company had merged their sacred trust assets to draw the
clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the worst
financial panic it had known in years. And so shrewdly had
they planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear
sky, and at a time when the nation was never more prosperous.</p>
<p>He laughed. It had been rich fun!</p>
<p>And then, the potato scheme. They had wagered that he
could not put it through. How neatly he had turned the trick,
filled his pockets, and transformed their doubts into wondering
admiration! It had been rare pleasure! Oh, yes, there had
been some suffering, he had been told. He had not given that
a thought.</p>
<p>And the Colombian revolution! How surprised the people
of these United States would be some day to learn that this
tropic struggle was in essence an American war! The smug
and unthinkingly contented in this great country of ours regarded
the frenzied combat in the far South as but a sort of
<i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i>. What fools, these Americans! And he, when
that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on
the emerald mines near Bogot&aacute;. The price? Untold suffering&ndash;&ndash;countless
broken hearts&ndash;&ndash;indescribable, maddening torture&ndash;&ndash;he
had not given that a thought.</p>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p>But he was tired, very tired. His trip to Washington had
been exhausting. He had not been well of late. His eyes had
been bloodshot, and there had been several slight hemorrhages
from the nose. His physician had shaken his head gravely, and
had admonished him to be careful&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_191' name='book4_page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>But why did that girl continue to fascinate him? he wondered.
Why now, in all his scheming and plotting, did he
always see her before him? Was it only because of her rare
physical beauty? If he wrote or read, her portrait lay upon
the page; if he glanced up, she stood there facing him. There
was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor trace of
hate. Nor did she ever threaten. No; but always she smiled&ndash;&ndash;always
she looked right into his eyes&ndash;&ndash;always she seemed to
say, &ldquo;You would destroy me, but yet I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God! What a plucky little fighter she was! And she fought
him fairly. Aye, much more so than he did her. She would
scorn the use of his methods. He had to admit <i>that</i>, though he
hated her, detested her, would have torn her into shreds&ndash;&ndash;even
while he acknowledged that he admired her, yes, beyond
all others, for her wonderful bravery and her loyal stand for
what she considered the right.</p>
<p>He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office
alone. Surely, that hideous object now floating before his
straining gaze, that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.
Hawley-Crowles, was not real! It was but a shadow, a flimsy
thing of thought! And that woestricken thing there, with its
tenuous arms extended toward him&ndash;&ndash;was that Gannette? Heavens,
no! Gannette had died, stark mad! But, that other shade&ndash;&ndash;so
like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive again! Whence
came that look of horror in a face once so haughty! It was
unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past! Ah, now he knew
that he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!
Oh, what a blessed relief to see that fair image there
among those other ghastly sights! He would speak to her&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But&ndash;&ndash;<i>God above</i>! <i>What was that?</i> A woman&ndash;&ndash;no, not
Carmen&ndash;&ndash;fair and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Her white lips moved&ndash;&ndash;they were transparent&ndash;&ndash;he could
see right through them&ndash;&ndash;and great tears dropped from her
bloodless cheeks when her accusing look fell upon him!</p>
<p>Slowly she floated nearer&ndash;&ndash;she stopped before him, and laid
a hand upon his shoulder&ndash;&ndash;it was cold, cold as ice! He tried
to call out&ndash;&ndash;to rise&ndash;&ndash;to break away&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration,
he awoke.</p>
<p>Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master&rsquo;s
white face. &ldquo;Mr. Ames! You are ill!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead. &ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a little
tired, that&rsquo;s all, I guess. What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk. &ldquo;It has
come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a delegation of Avon mill hands in
the outer office. Here are their demands. It&rsquo;s just what I
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_192' name='book4_page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>Ames slowly took up the envelope. For a moment he hesitated.
Again he seemed to see that smiling girl before him. His
jaw set, and his face drew slowly down into an expression of
malignity. Then, without examining its contents, he tore the
envelope into shreds, and cast the pieces into the waste basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them out of the office!&rdquo; he commanded sharply. &ldquo;Wire
Pillette at once to discharge these fellows, and every one else
concerned in the agitation! If those rats down there want to
fight, they&rsquo;ll find me ready!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>
</div>
<p>The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and
the great legs might have been seen to drag a bit, as the
man entered his private elevator the morning after his
rejection of the mill hands&rsquo; demands, and turned the lever that
caused the lift to soar lightly to his office above. And a mouse&ndash;&ndash;had
the immaculate condition of his luxurious <i>sanctum</i>
permitted such an alien dweller&ndash;&ndash;could have seen him sink
heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep thought.
Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all
away, and bent anew to his meditations.</p>
<p>Truth to tell&ndash;&ndash;though he would not have owned it&ndash;&ndash;the
man was now dimly conscious of a new force at work upon
him; of a change, slowly, subtly taking place somewhere deep
within. He was feebly cognizant of emotions quite unknown;
of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were but just crystallizing
out from the thick magma of his materialistic soul.</p>
<p>And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear
unto himself weak, even effeminate! His abhorrence of sentimentalism
had been among the strongest of his life-characteristics;
and yet, though he could not define it, a mellowing
something seemed to be acting upon him that dull, bitterly cold
winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout his mental
chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged things
of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp outlines.
He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought,
as he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast. And
yet the girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that
it was an interrogation, even the eternal question, &ldquo;What shall
it profit a man&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked up. The door had opened, he thought.
Then he sat bolt upright and stared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_193' name='book4_page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Ames. May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come in! Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears
before! This was not another dream! The vision this time
was real! He sprang to his feet. He would have held out his
arms to her if he could.</p>
<p>And yet, how dared she come to him? How dared she,
after what she had done? Was this fresh affrontery? Had
she come again to flout him? To stand within the protection
which her sex afforded and vivisect anew his tired soul? But,
whatever her motives, this girl did the most daring things he
had ever seen a woman do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny,&rdquo; she said, as she stood before him with a
whimsical little smile, &ldquo;that wherever I go people so seldom
ask me to sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames sank back into his seat without speaking. Carmen
stood for a moment looking about her rich environment; then
drew up a chair close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea why I have come here, have
you?&rdquo; she said sweetly, looking up into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this
unexpected pleasure,&rdquo; he returned guardedly, bending his head
in mock deference, while the great wonder retained possession
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on lightly, &ldquo;will you believe me when I tell
you that I have come here because I love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aha! A dark suspicion sprang up within him. So this
was an attack from a different quarter! Hitt and Haynerd had
invoked her feminine wiles, eh?</p>
<p>Nonsense! With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which
had been shedding its influence upon him that morning laid
the ugly suspicion dead at his feet. A single glance into that
sweet face turned so lovingly up to his brought his own deep
curse upon himself for his hellish thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy
gaiety, &ldquo;I just had to run the gauntlet through guards and
clerks and office boys to get here. Aren&rsquo;t you glad I didn&rsquo;t send
in my card? For then you would have refused to see me,
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not!&rdquo; he replied harshly. Then he repented his
tone. &ldquo;If I had known you were out there,&rdquo; he said more
gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have sent out and had you dragged in. I&ndash;&ndash;I have
wanted something this morning; and now I am sure it was&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth,
&ldquo;you wanted <i>me</i>. I knew you would. You see, it&rsquo;s just absolutely
impossible to oppose anybody who loves you. You know,
that&rsquo;s the very method Jesus gave for overcoming our enemies&ndash;&ndash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_194' name='book4_page_194'></a>194</span>
love them, just love them to pieces, until we find that we
haven&rsquo;t any enemies at all any more. Isn&rsquo;t it simple? My!
Well, that&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve been doing with you&ndash;&ndash;just loving
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s brows knotted, and his lips tightened. Was this
girl ridiculing him? Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity
expressed in the face from which he could not take his
eyes? Impossible! And yet, did ever human being talk so
strangely, so weirdly, as she?</p>
<p>He bent a little closer to her. &ldquo;Did you say that you loved
me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I thought you looked upon me as a human
monster.&rdquo; After all, there was a note of pathos in the question.
Carmen laid her hand upon his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>real</i> you that I love,&rdquo; she answered gently. &ldquo;The
monster is only human thought&ndash;&ndash;the thought that has seemed
to mesmerize you. But you are going to throw off the mesmerism,
aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; she added brightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going to put off the &lsquo;old man&rsquo; completely&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re going to
begin by opening yourself and letting in a little love for those
poor people down at Avon, aren&rsquo;t you? Yes, you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern
and dark. And yet she spoke of them alone. She had not
mentioned the Beaubien, Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself.
He noted this, and wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, you don&rsquo;t understand, Mr. Ames. You&rsquo;ll be, oh,
so surprised some day when you learn a little about the laws of
thought&ndash;&ndash;even the way human thought operates! For you
can&rsquo;t possibly do another person an injury without that injury
flying back and striking you. It&rsquo;s a regular boomerang! You
may not feel the effects of its return right away&ndash;&ndash;but it does
return, and the effects accumulate. And then, some day, when
you least expect it, comes the crash! But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes
alone. It just brings loads of good with it. It helps you, and
everybody. Oh, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she cried, suddenly rising and seizing
both his hands, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to love those people down
there! You can&rsquo;t help it, even if you think you can, for hate is
not real&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s an awful delusion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an
affirmation of things true and yet to come. The mighty <i>Thou
shalt not!</i> which Moses laid upon his people, when transfused
by the omnipotent love of the Christ was transformed from
a clanking chain into a silken cord. The restriction became a
prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the benign influence
of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_195' name='book4_page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.
Ames groped within his thought for a reply. And then his mental
grasp closed upon the words of Hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very bitter against me&ndash;&ndash;they hate me!&rdquo; he retorted
lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;They reflect in kind your
thought of them. Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation,
of utter indifference which you have hurled at them, have
returned upon you in hatred. Do you know that hatred is a
fearful poison? And do you know that another&rsquo;s hatred resting
upon you is deadly, unless you know how to meet and neutralize
it with love? For love is the neutralizing alkaloid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is&ndash;&ndash;weakness,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;That kind, at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love weakness! Oh! Why, there is no such mighty power
in the whole universe as love! It is omnipotent! It is hatred
that is weak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames made a little gesture of contempt. &ldquo;We argue from
different standpoints,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am a plain, matter-of-fact,
cold-blooded business man. There is no love in business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, &ldquo;is
why business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so
much anxiety, fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.
Mr. Ames, you haven&rsquo;t the slightest conception of real business,
have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat for a moment in thought. Then, brightly, &ldquo;I am in
business, Mr. Ames&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I am forced to agree with you there! The business
of attempting to annihilate me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all
mankind,&rdquo; she gently corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining
from meddling further in my affairs. Suppose from now on
you let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I am not meddling with you, Mr. Ames!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several
copies of the Express. &ldquo;I am to consider that this is not
strictly meddling, eh?&rdquo; he continued, as he laid the papers
before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; she promptly replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s uncovering
evil, so&rsquo;s it can be destroyed. All that evil, calling itself you
and your business, has got to come to the surface&ndash;&ndash;has got
to come up to the light, so that it can be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see. Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?
And afterward destroyed. A very pretty little idea! And the
mines and mills which I own&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_196' name='book4_page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You own nothing, Mr. Ames, except by consent of the
people whom you oppress. They will wake up some day; and
then state and national ownership of public utilities will come,
forced by such as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that desideratum will result in making everybody
honest, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;We must go deeper than
that. All our present troubles, whether domestic, business,
civic, or social, come from a total misapprehension of the nature
of God&ndash;&ndash;a misunderstanding of what is really <i>good</i>. We have
<i>all</i> got to prove Him. And we are very foolish to lose any
more time setting about it, don&rsquo;t you think so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on, while he sat studying her, &ldquo;those
poor people down at Avon don&rsquo;t know any more about what is
the real good than you do. And that&rsquo;s why their thoughts and
yours center upon the false pleasures of this ephemeral existence
called life&ndash;&ndash;this existence of the so-called physical senses&ndash;&ndash;and
why you both become the tools of vice, disease, and misfortune.
They build up such men as you, and then you turn
about and crush them. And in the end you are both what
the Bible says&ndash;&ndash;poor, deluded fools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t swear!&rdquo; she pleaded, again seizing his hand
and laughing up into his face. But then her smile vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you started to prove God,&rdquo; she said earnestly.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you begin now&ndash;&ndash;to-day? Haven&rsquo;t you yet learned that
evil is the very stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in
the world? It is, really. Won&rsquo;t you turn from your material
endeavors now, and take time to learn to really live? You&rsquo;ve
got plenty of time, you know, for you aren&rsquo;t obliged to work for
a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his
cheek. Her soft little hand lay upon his own. And her great,
dark eyes looked into his with a light which he knew, despite
his perverted thought, came from the unquenchable flame of
her selfless love.</p>
<p>Again that unfamiliar sentiment&ndash;&ndash;nay, rather, that sentiment
long dormant&ndash;&ndash;stirred within him. Again his worldly
concepts, long entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow
it. He had not yet learned to analyze the thoughts which crept
so silently into his ever-open mentality. To all alike he gave
free access. And to those which savored of things earthy he
still gave the power to build, with himself as a willing tool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will&ndash;&ndash;help me&ndash;&ndash;to live?&rdquo; he said. He thought her the
most gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat
there before him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that
which all the gold of Ophir could not have bought.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_197' name='book4_page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, gladly&ndash;&ndash;oh, so gladly!&rdquo; Her eyes sparkled with a rush
of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said gently, drawing his chair a little
closer to her, &ldquo;that we have quite misunderstood each other?
I am sure we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; she answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; with a
happy smile again lighting her features, &ldquo;we can understand
each other now, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can! And hasn&rsquo;t the time come for us to
work together, instead of continuing to oppose each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes, indeed!&rdquo; she cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday
from Washington. I am&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need each other, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; the artless girl exclaimed,
as she beamed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am positive of it!&rdquo; he said with suggestive emphasis. &ldquo;I
can help you&ndash;&ndash;more than you realize&ndash;&ndash;and I want to. I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve
been sorry for you, little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that
story got abroad about&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind that!&rdquo; she interrupted happily. &ldquo;We are
living in the present, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True&ndash;&ndash;and in the future. But things haven&rsquo;t been right
for you. And I want to see them straightened out. And you
and I can do it, little one. Madam Beaubien hasn&rsquo;t been
treated right, either. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she laughed, holding up a warning finger. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to forget that in the good we&rsquo;re going to do, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. And you are going to get a square deal.
Now, I&rsquo;ve got a plan to make everything right. I want to see
you in the place that belongs to you. I want to see you happy,
and surrounded by all that is rightfully yours. And if you will
join me, we will bring that all about. I told you this once before,
you may remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she replied, her eyes shining with a great
hope, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think about me! It&rsquo;s the people at Avon that I
want to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help them, you and I. We&rsquo;ll make things right all
round. And Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble.
Nor shall the Express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ames! Do you really mean it? And&ndash;&ndash;Sidney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney shall come home&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and
clasped her arms about his neck. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it is love
that has done all this! And it has won you!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_198' name='book4_page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms. He
could feel the quick throbbing in her throat. Her warm breath
played upon his cheek like fitful tropic breezes. For a brief
moment the supreme gift of the universe seemed to be laid at
his feet. For a fleeting interval the man of dust faded, and a
new being, pure and white, seemed to rise within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured gently, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll take him to our home
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace
and stepped back. &ldquo;With&ndash;&ndash;<i>us</i>?&rdquo; she murmured, searching
his face for the meaning which she had dimly discerned in his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;listen!&rdquo; He reached forward and with a quick movement
seized her hand. &ldquo;Listen, little girl. I want you&ndash;&ndash;I want
you! Not now&ndash;&ndash;no, you needn&rsquo;t come to me until you are
ready. But say that you will come! Say that! Why, I didn&rsquo;t
know until to-day what it was that was making me over! It&rsquo;s
you! Don&rsquo;t go! Don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of
bewilderment upon her face, was moving toward the door.
&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;that you were&ndash;&ndash;were&ndash;&ndash;proposing
<i>marriage</i> to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just make all
things new! We&rsquo;ll begin all over again, you and I! Why, I&rsquo;ll
do anything&ndash;&ndash;anything in the world you say, Carmen, if you
will come to me&ndash;&ndash;if you will be my little wife!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;I know,&rdquo; he hastily resumed, as she halted and
stood seemingly rooted to the floor, &ldquo;there is a great difference
in our ages. But that is nothing&ndash;&ndash;many happy marriages are
made between ages just as far apart as ours. Think&ndash;&ndash;think
what it means to you! I&rsquo;ll make you a queen! I&rsquo;ll surround
you with limitless wealth! I&rsquo;ll make you leader of society!
I&rsquo;ll make Madam Beaubien rich! I&rsquo;ll support the Express, and
make it what you want it to be! I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say for
the people of Avon! Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen turned and came slowly back to him. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;you
will not do these things&ndash;&ndash;unless I marry you?&rdquo; she said in a
voice scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;oh, you were only deceiving me all the time! And
now&ndash;&ndash;if I refuse&ndash;&ndash;then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends upon you, entirely&ndash;&ndash;and you will come? Not
now&ndash;&ndash;but within the next few months&ndash;&ndash;within the year&ndash;&ndash;tell
me that you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you will do these things whether I come to you or
not?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_199' name='book4_page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put it all into your hands,&rdquo; he answered shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
named the condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange look crossed the girl&rsquo;s face. She stood as if
stunned. Then she glanced about in helpless bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;love&ndash;&ndash;you,&rdquo; she murmured, as she looked off toward
the window, but with unseeing eyes. &ldquo;I would do anything for
you that was right. I&ndash;&ndash;love&ndash;&ndash;everybody&ndash;&ndash;everybody; but there
are no conditions to <i>my</i> love. Oh!&rdquo; she suddenly cried, burying
her face in her hands and bursting into tears. &ldquo;You have
tried to <i>buy</i> me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames rose and came to her. Taking her by the hand he
led her, unresisting, back to her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, bending toward her. &ldquo;Go home now and
think it all over. Then let me know your answer. It was
sudden, I admit; I took you by surprise. But&ndash;&ndash;well, you are
not going to prevent the accomplishment of all that good, are
you? Think! It all depends upon your word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl raised her tear-stained face. She had been crushed;
and another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind&ndash;&ndash;that
human mind which has changed not in a thousand years&ndash;&ndash;had
been read to her. But again she smiled bravely, as she
wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It was all right all
the time&ndash;&ndash;and I was protected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned to him. &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she said gently, and
in a voice that trembled just a little, &ldquo;you will help the people
of Avon, but not because I shall marry you. God does not
work that way. I have loved you. And I love them. And
nothing can kill that love. God will open the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you refuse my offer, do you?&rdquo; he asked sharply, as
his face set. &ldquo;Remember, all the blame will be upon you. I
have shown you a way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him. She saw now with a clairvoyance
which separated him from the mask which he had worn. Her
glance penetrated until it found his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind,&rdquo; she
slowly replied. &ldquo;The responsibility is not with me, but with&ndash;&ndash;God.
I&ndash;&ndash;I came to-day to&ndash;&ndash;to help you. But now I must leave
you&ndash;&ndash;with Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.
As he did so, a letter fell out. He seized it and glanced at the
superscription.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cartagena! To Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n! Another little <i>billet-doux</i>
to your priestly lover, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down at the letter which he held. &ldquo;It is money,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_200' name='book4_page_200'></a>200</span>
she said, though her thought seemed far away. &ldquo;Money that
I am sending to a little newsboy who bears his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! His brat! But, you still love that fallen priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the whispered answer.</p>
<p>He rose and opened a drawer in his desk. Taking out a
paper-bound book, he held it out to the girl. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he
sneered. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little piece of work which your brilliant
lover did some time ago. &lsquo;Confessions of a Roman Catholic
Priest.&rsquo; Do you know the penalty your clerical paramour paid
for that, eh? Then I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; bending over close to her
ear, &ldquo;his <i>life</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen rose unsteadily. The color had fled from her
cheeks. She staggered a few steps toward the door, then
stopped. &ldquo;God&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;<i>everywhere</i>!&rdquo; she murmured. It was
the refuge of her childhood days.</p>
<p>Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>
</div>
<p>If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one&rsquo;s fellow-men
were required, the strike which burst upon the industrial
world that winter must furnish it in sickening excess.
But other facts, too, were rendered glaringly patent by
that same desperate clash which made Avon a shambles and
transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken only
in hushed whispers when one&rsquo;s thought dwells for a moment
upon the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted
blood. The man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that
still unbridged void which separates master and servant, and
which a money-drunk class insolently calls God-made, grows
wider with each roar of musketry aimed by a frenzied militia
at helpless men and women; grows deeper with each splitting
crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder the conscienceless
wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.</p>
<p>Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too. Ames may have
dimly marked the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything
that manifested opposition to this superhuman will, it only set
his teeth the firmer and thickened the callous about his cold
heart. Carmen saw it, too. And she knew&ndash;&ndash;and the world must
some day know&ndash;&ndash;that but one tie has ever been designed adequate
to bridge this yawning ca&ntilde;on of human hatred. That tie
is love. Aye, well she knew that the world laughed, and called
it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_201' name='book4_page_201'></a>201</span>
well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has
ever seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of
the creed of love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the
frantic grasping of a nation&rsquo;s resources, and the ruthless murder
of those who ask that they, too, may have a share in that
abundance which is the common birthright of all. Do the
political bully, the grafter, the tout, know the meaning of love?
No; but they can be taught. Oh, not by the hypocritical millionaire
pietists who prate their glib platitudes to their Sunday
Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to order the
slaughter of starving women and babes! They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells
them that evil is good. Nor by the Church, with its lamentable
weakness of knowledge and works. Only by those who have
learned something of the Christ-principle, and are striving daily
to demonstrate its omnipotence in part, can the world be taught
a saving knowledge of the love that solves every problem and
creates a new heaven and a newer, better concept of the earth
and its fullness.</p>
<p>That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express
received word of the walk-out of the Avon mill employes. Almost
coincident with the arrival of the news, Carmen herself
came unsteadily into Hitt&rsquo;s office. The editor glanced up at
her, then looked a second time. He had never before seen her
face colorless. Finally he laid down his papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;What work have you&ndash;&ndash;for
me&ndash;&ndash;to-day?&rdquo; She smiled, though her lips trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; he pursued, scanning her closely.</p>
<p>She did not reply at once. Then, so low that he scarcely
caught the words, &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have been with&ndash;&ndash;a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment.
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he cried as he saw Carmen. &ldquo;How does it happen
you&rsquo;re out riding with Willett? Saw him help you out of an
auto just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought me here,&rdquo; she answered softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths. She
turned, and started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.
As she neared the door she stumbled. Sidney sprang after
her and caught her in his arms. When she turned her face,
they saw that her eyes were swimming in tears.</p>
<p>Hitt was on his feet instantly. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong! Leave us, Sidney. Let me talk with her
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_202' name='book4_page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>The boy reluctantly obeyed. Hitt closed the door after him,
then took the girl&rsquo;s hand and led her back to his own chair.
&ldquo;Now, little one,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she sat quiet. Then the tears began to flow;
and then she leaned her head against him and sobbed&ndash;&ndash;sobbed
as does the stricken mother who hangs over the lifeless form
of her babe&ndash;&ndash;sobbed as does the strong man bereft of the friend
of his bosom&ndash;&ndash;sobbed as did the Man of Sorrow, when he held
out his arms over the worldly city that cruelly rejected him.
He was the channel for the divine; yet the wickedness of the
human mind broke his great heart. Carmen was not far from
him at that moment.</p>
<p>Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled
his throat. Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked
up into his anxious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all past now,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;Jesus forgave them
that killed him. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been with&ndash;&ndash;Ames?&rdquo; said Hitt in a low, quiet tone.
&ldquo;And he tried to kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;he knew not what he was doing. Evil used him, because
as yet he has no spiritual understanding. But&ndash;&ndash;God is
life! There is&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;death!&rdquo; Her voice faded away in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story. What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen got to her feet. &ldquo;Nothing happened, Mr. Hitt&ndash;&ndash;nothing.
It didn&rsquo;t happen&ndash;&ndash;it wasn&rsquo;t real. I&ndash;&ndash;I seemed to
manifest weakness&ndash;&ndash;and I fell&ndash;&ndash;to the floor&ndash;&ndash;but I didn&rsquo;t lose
consciousness. And just then Mr. Willett came in&ndash;&ndash;and Mr.
Ames sent me here with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?&rdquo; persisted Hitt,
his face dark with anger.</p>
<p>The girl smiled feebly. &ldquo;I see Mr. Ames only as&ndash;&ndash;as God&rsquo;s
child,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Evil is not real, and it doesn&rsquo;t happen.
Now I want to work&ndash;&ndash;work as I never did before! I must!
<i>I must!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell me more about it?&rdquo; he asked, for he
knew now that a deadly thrust had been made at the girl&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>She brushed the tears away from her eyes. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo;
was her reply. &ldquo;Good is all that is. God is life. There
is <i>no</i> death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A suspicion flashed into Hitt&rsquo;s mind, kindled by the girl&rsquo;s
insistence upon the nothingness of death. &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; he asked,
&ldquo;did he tell you that&ndash;&ndash;some one had died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came to him and laid her head against him. Her hands
stole into his. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Please, Mr. Hitt! We must never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_203' name='book4_page_203'></a>203</span>
speak of this again! Promise me! I shall overcome it, for God
is with me. Promise that no one but us shall know! Make
Sidney promise. It&ndash;&ndash;it is&ndash;&ndash;for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes grew moist, and his throat filled. He drew
the girl to him and kissed her forehead. &ldquo;It shall be as you
wish, little one,&rdquo; he said in a choking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now set me to work!&rdquo; she cried wildly. &ldquo;Anything! This
is another opportunity to&ndash;&ndash;to prove God! I must prove Him!
I must&ndash;&ndash;right here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to his desk with a heavy heart. &ldquo;There is work
to be done now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it. At
once she became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless
love. &ldquo;Oh, they have gone out at Avon! Those mothers and
children&ndash;&ndash;they need me! Mr. Hitt, I must go there at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; he replied, swallowing hard. &ldquo;I knew what
you would do. But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.
Go home now, and get ready. You can go down in the
morning. And we, Sidney and I, will say nothing of&ndash;&ndash;of your
visit to his father.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and
Haynerd might come and talk with her after the paper had
gone to press, and requesting that she notify Carmen and
Father Waite. A few hours later the little group met quietly
in the humble cottage. Miss Wall and Sidney were with them.
And to them all those first dark hours of morning, when as yet
the symbol of God&rsquo;s omnipresence hung far below the horizon,
seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil&rsquo;s further claims to
the lives and fortunes of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked you here,&rdquo; Hitt gravely announced when they
were assembled, &ldquo;to consider a matter which touches us all&ndash;&ndash;how
deeply, God alone knows. At ten o&rsquo;clock to-night I received
this message.&rdquo; He opened the paper which he held in
his hand and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
storage tanks, destroyed by fire. Dynamite in pump houses exploded,
causing wells to cave and choke. Loss complete. Wire instructions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.
Haynerd, who, like the others, had been kept in ignorance of
the message until now, started from his chair with a loud exclamation,
then sank back limp. Carmen&rsquo;s face went white.
Evil seemed to have chosen that day with canny shrewdness to
overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the darkness of
the carnal mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_204' name='book4_page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>Hitt broke the tense silence. &ldquo;I see in this,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;the culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.
That my oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the
slightest doubt. Nor can I doubt by whose hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice.
&ldquo;Ames&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt replied indirectly. &ldquo;The Express has stood before the
world as a paper unique and apart. And because of its high
ideals, the forces of evil singled it out at the beginning for their
murderous assaults. That the press of this country is very
generally muzzled, stifled, bought and paid for, I have good
reason now to know. My constant brushes with the liquor interests,
with low politicians, judges, senators, and dive-keepers,
have not been revealed even to you. Could you know the pressure
which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant, has tried
to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.
But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism. It has fearlessly opposed
the legalizing of drugging. It has fought the debauching
of a nation&rsquo;s manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison,
alcohol. And it has fought without quarter the pernicious
activity of morally stunted brewers and distillers, whose hellish
motto is, &lsquo;Make the boys drink!&rsquo; It has fought the money
octopus, and again and again has sounded to the world the peril
which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his clique constitute.
And for that we must now wear the crown of martyrdom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a
long time. Then Hitt resumed. &ldquo;The Express has not been
self-supporting. Its growth has been steady, but it has depended
for its deficit upon the revenue from my oil property.
And so have we all. Ames ruined Madam Beaubien financially,
as well as Miss Wall. He cleaned you out, Ned. And now,
knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed Haynerd, &ldquo;your property was insured,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile. &ldquo;But
with the proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the
premises. You will note that dynamite wrecked the wells. That
doubtless renders my policies void. But, even in case I should
have a fighting chance with the insurance companies, don&rsquo;t you
think that they will be advised that I purposely set fire to the
wells, in order to collect the insurance? I most certainly do.
And I shall find myself with a big lawsuit on my hands, and
with no funds to conduct the fight. Ames&rsquo;s work, you know,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_205' name='book4_page_205'></a>205</span>
is always thorough, and the Express is already facing his suit
for libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told us you were going to mortgage your property,&rdquo;
said Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood ready to, should the Express require it. But, with
its recent little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as
yet,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Haynerd. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ned, God <i>is</i> good!&rdquo; It was Carmen who spoke.</p>
<p>Hitt turned quickly to the girl. &ldquo;Can you say that, after
all you have endured, Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder. &ldquo;An outcast
babe,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;left on the banks of a great river
far, far away; reared without knowledge of father or mother,
and amid perils that hourly threatened to crush her; torn from
her beloved ones and thrust out into an unknown and unsympathetic
world; used as a stepping-stone to advance the low
social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the foulest
slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned
at her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love,
even though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in
the flames of war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost;
spurned from the door of the rich man whom she sought to
save; carrying with her always the knowledge that the one
upon whom her affections had centered had a son in distant
Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of the
little lad; and now, this morning&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He stopped, for he remembered
his promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;shielded by the One who is
both Father and Mother to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That One surely ought to love you, Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; she answered softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear. &ldquo;What
are we going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do,&rdquo;
replied the girl.</p>
<p>She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took
from it a Bible. Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the
entire fourteenth chapter of Exodus. Then she concluded
by reading the last two verses of the eighth chapter of
Romans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, looking up, &ldquo;we know what we are going
to do, don&rsquo;t we? We are going right on, as &lsquo;seeing Him who is
invisible&rsquo; to men like Mr. Ames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat looking at her in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_206' name='book4_page_206'></a>206</span>
or of any department of human thought, that can overthrow
legitimate business; and we are in the legitimate business of
reflecting God to the world. If the physical sense of supply is
now lost, we are fortunate, for now we are obliged to acquire
a higher sense. All that we have comes from God. And we
become aware of it in our own consciousness. It is there that
we interpret His supply. Mr. Ames interprets it one way; we,
in a very different way. God has always been able to prepare
a table in the wilderness of human thought. If we look for
supply from without, we shall not find it, for everything is
within. And the very fact that there is a legitimate demand
shows that there is the supply to meet it, for&ndash;&ndash;though the world
hasn&rsquo;t learned this yet&ndash;&ndash;<i>it is the supply itself that really creates
the demand</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But money makes the wheels go!&rdquo; retorted Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God. He is our only
supply. He is our Principle&ndash;&ndash;infinite, inexhaustible. He is our
credit&ndash;&ndash;without limit! We are facing a crisis, but, like every
seeming disturbance of the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a
little while if we but cling to the divine Mind that is God for
guidance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket. &ldquo;Are
you going to Avon to-morrow?&rdquo; he abruptly asked of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford it now!&rdquo; cried Haynerd.</p>
<p>Hitt reflected a moment. Then he rose. &ldquo;And we sit here
lamenting!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And when we have in our midst
this girl, who has borne, without one word of complaint or reviling,
the world&rsquo;s most poignant sorrows! I&ndash;&ndash;I really regret
that I told you of&ndash;&ndash;of this telegram. I seemed for a moment to
be overwhelmed. But I am on my feet again now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he
handed to Carmen. &ldquo;That will see you through for a day or so
down there. If you need more, wire me. I&rsquo;ll get it from some
source! Come,&rdquo; he added, beckoning to Haynerd, &ldquo;the Express
will be issued to-morrow as usual, and we must get to bed. I&rsquo;ve
really had quite a strenuous day!&rdquo; He turned, then paused and
looked at Carmen.</p>
<p>The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly
to the piano. Hitt followed and bent over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you do not feel like it. This day has
been a hard one for you, I know. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do feel like it,&rdquo; she answered, smiling up at him. &ldquo;I
want to sing for you. And,&rdquo; her voice dropped low, &ldquo;I want to
sing to&ndash;&ndash;Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt gulped down something in his throat. &ldquo;The bravest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_207' name='book4_page_207'></a>207</span>
little girl in the whole wide world!&rdquo; he muttered through his
set teeth.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical
effect of definite mental causes. It was the orderly sequence of
an endless train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and
the fear of starvation. And starvation is the externalized human
belief that life is at the caprice of intelligent matter. But
that is an infraction of the first Commandment, given when the
human race was a babe.</p>
<p>When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the
day following Ames&rsquo;s rejection of their demands, the master
closed the doors behind them and locked them out. Were not
these mills his?</p>
<p>No, they were a sacred trust asset.</p>
<p>Bah! The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!</p>
<p>But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with
never a dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into
the blasts of the bitterest winter the New England states had
known in years!</p>
<p>True; but why, then, did they strike? For, you see, that of
itself proved the soundness of Ames&rsquo;s single reply to all
further appeal: &ldquo;There is nothing whatever to arbitrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower,
both black and red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.
There grow the brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail. About
these hardier stems twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse,
the morgue. And Satan, &ldquo;the man-killer from the beginning,&rdquo;
waters their roots and makes fallow the soil with the
blood of fools. But of those for whom the gardener waits, there
is none whose blood is so life-giving to these noxious plants as
that type of the materially rich who, like Ames, have waxed
gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.</p>
<p>Ames was a gambler in human lives. They were his
chips, by which he gained or lost, and of themselves were void
of intrinsic value. The world was the table whereon he played;
the game <i>rouge et noir</i>, with the whirl of predatory commercialism
as the wheel, and the ball weighted to drop where he
might direct. He carried millions on margin, and with them
carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions of his
fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.</p>
<p>It had been his custom to close his mills for several months
each year, in order to save expense when times were dull. And
he did this as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and
with much less thought for the welfare of those concerned. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_208' name='book4_page_208'></a>208</span>
is doubtful if he had ever really considered the fact that these
four thousand human beings were wholly dependent upon him
for their very existence. For he was a business man, and gold
was far weightier in the scale of values than human flesh, and
much less easily obtained. Cain&rsquo;s comforting philosophy was
quite correct, else would the business world not have been so
firmly established upon it. Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon
which these swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in
the dust.</p>
<p>And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the
hungry hordes, he would frame the terms upon which they
should be reopened. The eight-hour law must not be enforced.
Perhaps he could influence the Supreme Court to declare it
unconstitutional, as depriving the mill hands of the right to
labor as long as they pleased. Wages should not be raised.
And the right to organize and band together for their common
good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more. If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to
slay. Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out
trade-unionism within the confines of his activities. He would
win the plaudits of the whole industrial world by so doing. He
therefore immediately got in touch with the Governor, a Tammany
puppet, and received that loyal henchman&rsquo;s warm assurances
of hearty support for any measures which the great
magnate might wish to enforce. He then approached the officers
of the state guard, and secured them to a man. Times
were hard, and they welcomed his favor. He finally posted
armed guards in all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember
that property rights were of divine institution. Then
he sat down and dictated the general policy to be followed by
the Amalgamated Spinners&rsquo; Association throughout the country
in support of his own selfish ends.</p>
<p>His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was
tremendous. His agents swarmed over the state like ants. The
Catholic Archbishop was instructed that he must remove Father
Danny from Avon, as his influence was pernicious. But the
objection was made that the priest was engaged only in humanitarian
labors. It availed not; Ames desired the man&rsquo;s removal.
And removed he was. The widow Marcus likewise had been
doing much talking. Ames&rsquo;s lawyer, Collins, had her haled
into court and thoroughly reprimanded. And then, that matters
might be precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with
the necessity of altering the cotton schedule in favor of the
Spinners&rsquo; Association, Ames ordered his agents to raise the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_209' name='book4_page_209'></a>209</span>
rents of his miserable Avon tenements. There were few, he
knew, who dared even attempt to meet the raise; and those
who could not, he ordered set into the streets.</p>
<p>It was a wild winter&rsquo;s day that the magnate chose for the
enforcement of this cruel order. A driving blizzard had raged
throughout the night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in
places many feet deep. The temperature was freezing, and the
strong east wind cut like a knife. It was Ames&rsquo;s desire to teach
these scum a needed lesson, and he had chosen to enlist the
elements to aid him in the righteous task.</p>
<p>For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had
lived among these hectored people. Daily her reports of the
unbearable situation had gone to Hitt. And through them the
editor had daily striven to awaken a nation&rsquo;s conscience. Ames
read the articles, and through the columns of the Budget sought
to modify them to the extent of shifting the responsibility to
the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and to a dilatory
Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a cotton
tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible. Nor
did he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its
personnel.</p>
<p>Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic
work of ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.
Ames&rsquo;s hirelings, with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and
city police in the miserable work, themselves cursing often because
of the keen blasts that nipped their ears and numbed
their well-cased limbs. More than one tiny, wailing babe was
frozen at the breast that dull, drab afternoon, when the sun
hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just above the horizon,
and its weird, yellow light flitted through the snow-laden
streets like gaunt spectres of death. More than one aged, toil-spent
laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his insatiable
master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his thin
life-current froze and his tired heart stopped. More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the
divine right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove
with him, only to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance,
be left in a welter of crimson on the drifting snow. Carmen
saw it all. She had been to see Pillette that same morning,
and had been laughed from his presence. She did not understand,
she was told, what miserable creatures these were that
dared ask for bread and human rights. Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.</p>
<p>And so they did. And the color was red. And it spurted
like fountains from their veins. And they saw it with dimming
eyes, and were glad, for it brought sweet oblivion. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_210' name='book4_page_210'></a>210</span>
night there were great fires built along the frozen creek. Shacks
and tents were hastily reared; and the shivering, trembling
women and babes given a desperate shelter. Then the men,
sullen and grim, drew off into little groups, and into the saloons
and gambling halls of the town. And when the blizzard was
spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen light, these
dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first, circling about
like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and power
with each revolution. More than a thousand strong, they
circled out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up
along the main thoroughfare. Their dull murmurs slowly
gained volume. Their low curses welled into a roar. And
then, like the sudden bursting of pent-up lava, they swept madly
through the town, carrying everything to destruction before
them.</p>
<p>Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave
of maddened humanity. Guns and pistols were thrown from
laden shelves to the cursing, sweating mob below. Axes and
knives were gathered by armfuls, and borne out into the streets
to the whirling mass. Great barrels of liquor were rolled into
the gutters and burst asunder. Bread and meat were dragged
from the shops and savagely devoured. The police gathered
and planted themselves with spitting pistols before the human
surge. They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.
Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent
wild, incoherent appeals for help to New York. Pandemonium
had the reins, the carnal mind was unleashed.</p>
<p>On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house
of Pillette, the resident manager of the great Ames mills. On
over the high iron fence, like hungry dock rats. On through
the battered gate. On up the broad drive, shouting, shooting,
moaning, raving. On over the veranda, and in through broken
windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies over reeking
carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked roof
of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette
and his wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring
furnace.</p>
<p>Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed
you who bear the world&rsquo;s burdens! It is you who create the
rich man&rsquo;s wealth, and fight his battles. So ye fought in the
great war between North and South, and protected the rich man
at home, hovering in fright over his money bags. It is you
who put into his hands the bayonet which he turns against you
to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous privilege. It
is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great nation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_211' name='book4_page_211'></a>211</span>
lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?
What, with your stupendous, untried strength? Will ye once
more set up the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?
Will ye again enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before
image of Virgin and Saint? Will ye raise high the powers
of mediaeval darkness, and bend your necks anew to the yoke
of ignorance and stagnation? But think you now that flames
and dynamite will break your present bonds? Aye, America
may be made a land without a pauper, without a millionaire,
without industrial strife. But fire and sword will not effect the
transformation. Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our &ldquo;comfortable
social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms.&rdquo; But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?
For shall we know then how to use our precious liberty?</p>
<p>Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming
wreckage and flowed down toward the mills. There were
some among them, saner, and prescient of the dire consequences
of their awful work, who counseled restraint. But they were
as chips in a torrent. Down into the creek bottom rolled the
seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up the far side
and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the great
mills. A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not. Those within
the buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws
of the ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed
with desperation.</p>
<p>In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, &ldquo;The hour of
departure has arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to
live. Which is better, God only knows.&rdquo; And mankind through
the ages in their last hours have echoed this sentiment of the
gentle philosopher. For all human philosophy leads to a single
end&ndash;&ndash;resignation.</p>
<p>But hunger transforms resignation into madness. And madness
is murder. The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames
mills knew in their heart of hearts that death was preferable
to life in death under the goad of human exploitation. But
such knowledge came only in rational moments. Now they
were crazed and beyond reason.</p>
<p>In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where
the souls of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had
gone out in withering heat. In the stricken town, men huddled
their trembling loved ones about them and stood with loaded
muskets. Somewhere on the steel bands that linked this scene
of carnage with the great metropolis beyond, a train plunged
and roared, leaping over the quivering rails at the rate of a
hundred miles an hour, bringing eager militiamen and their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_212' name='book4_page_212'></a>212</span>
deadly instruments of civilization. For the Ames mills were
private property. And that was a divine institution.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the
master sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.
Though they strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames
himself remained calm and determined. He was in constant
communication with the Governor at Albany, and with the
municipal officers of both New York and Avon. He had received
the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family with
a grim smile. But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor
that the New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once
to protect his property, and specified that the bullets used
should be of the &ldquo;dum-dum&rdquo; variety. For they added to the
horrors of death. Such bullets had been prohibited by the
rules of modern warfare, it was true. But this was a class
war. And Ames, foreseeing it all, had purchased a hundred
thousand rounds of these hellish things for the militia to exchange
for those which the Government furnished. And then,
as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as
might enter the industrial conflict being waged against him.</p>
<p>Had the man gone mad? That he had! And in the blood-red
haze that hung before his glittering eyes was framed the
face of the girl who had spurned him but a few days before.
She was the embodiment of love that had crossed his path and
stirred up the very quintessence of evil within him. From the
first she had drawn him. From the first she had aroused within
his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never known
before. And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box
at the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her
fathomless eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires
to possess that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.</p>
<p>But always she had eluded him. Always she hovered just
within his grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers
closed. Always she told him she loved him&ndash;&ndash;and he knew she
lied not. But such love was not his kind. When he loved, he
possessed and used. And such love had its price&ndash;&ndash;but not
hers. And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin with despair.
She was a babe! Yet she conquered him. He was
omnipotent in this world! Her strength she drew from the
world invisible. And with it she had laid the giant low and
bound him with chains.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_213' name='book4_page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>Not so! Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever;
though with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with
it he had also bidden every tender sentiment, every last vestige
of good depart from his thought forever more. And:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;with hope, farewell fear,<br />
Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;<br />
Evil, be thou my good!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>That same night Hitt&rsquo;s wells burned. And that night the
master slept not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth
Avenue mansion, and plotted the annihilation of every human
being who had dared oppose his worldly ambitions. Plotted,
too, the further degradation and final ruin of the girl who had
dared to say she loved him, and yet would not become his toy.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and
social system upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization
rests, for that system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it
bears. A bit of that poisonous fruit had now dropped from
the slimy branch at Avon. Up from the yards came the militiamen
at double-quick, with rifles unslung and loaded with the
satanic Ames bullets. Behind them they dragged two machine
guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a minute.
The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered
doors. Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting
every inch of the way. The dead lay in heaps. The air
was thick with powder smoke. One end of the building was in
flames. The roar of battle was deafening.</p>
<p>Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the
mill hands. Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and
fled down the frozen stream. The officers of the guard then
ordered their men to join in the work of extinguishing the
flames, which were beginning to make headway, fanned by the
strong draft which swept through the long building. Until
dawn they fought the stubborn fire. Then, the building saved,
they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.</p>
<p>At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained
the task of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing
them to justice. The town had been placed under martial
law with the arrival of the militia. Its streets were patrolled by
armed guards, and a strong cordon had been thrown around
the shacks which the mill hands had hastily erected the afternoon
before. And now, under the protection of a detachment
of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional surrender
of the striking laborers.</p>
<p>Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_214' name='book4_page_214'></a>214</span>
along the dead stream. It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror
of the victim who awaits the blow from the lion&rsquo;s paw in
the arena. Weeping wives and mothers, clasping their little
ones to them, knelt upon the frozen ground and crossed themselves.
Young men drew their newly-wed mates to their breasts
and kissed them with trembling lips. Stern, hard-faced men,
with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked out in
deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.</p>
<p>Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen,
up the slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed
machine gun, at the side of which stood Major Camp. She had
been all night with these bewildered, maddened people. She
had warmed shivering babes at her own breast. She had comforted
widows of a night, and newly-bereaved mothers. She
had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender words
of counsel and advice. And they had clung to her weeping;
they had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they
named her the Angel of Avon&ndash;&ndash;and the name would leave her
no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take me into court, and let me tell
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major fell back in amazement. This beautiful, well-clad
girl among such miserable vermin!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have demanded their leaders,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I have
been trying to lead them. Leave them, and take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major&rsquo;s eyes roved over her face and figure. He could
make nothing out of her words, but he motioned to an aid,
and bade him place the girl under arrest.</p>
<p>A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved
quietly away under guard. It was the last roar of raging despair.
The girl was being taken from them! A dozen men
sprang out and rushed, muskets in hand, up toward the soldiers
to liberate her. The major called to them to halt. Poor, dull-witted
creatures! Their narrow vision could comprehend but
one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the girl only
an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous injuries.</p>
<p>The major shouted a command. A roar burst from the
soldiers&rsquo; rifles. It was answered by a shriek of rage from the
hovels, and a murderous return fire. Then the major gave another
loud command, and the machine guns began to vomit
forth their clattering message of death.</p>
<p>At the sound of shooting, Carmen&rsquo;s guard halted. Then one
of them fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers. The others
released the girl, and hurried back to the battle line. Carmen
stood alone for a moment. Bullets whizzed close about her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_215' name='book4_page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>One sang its death-song almost in her ear. Another tore
through her coat. Then she turned and made her way slowly
up the hill to the paralyzed town.</p>
<p>Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long,
sweeping strokes. The two machine guns poured a flaming
sheet of lead into the little camp below. The shacks fell like
houses of cards. The tents caught fire, and were whirled blazing
aloft by the brisk wind. Men dropped like chaff from a
mill. Hysterical, screaming women rushed hither and yon to
save their young, and were torn to shreds by the merciless
fusillade from above. Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies. And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such
ghastly work is done among civilized men to-day.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray
between them and the earth below, that they might not see the
red embers and stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with
bent head, into the office of the Express. As she approached
Hitt&rsquo;s door she heard him in earnest conversation with Haynerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the editor was saying, &ldquo;I had a mortgage placed on
the Express to-day, but I couldn&rsquo;t get much. And it&rsquo;s a short-term
one, at that. Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless
we would let him dictate the policy of the paper. No, he
wouldn&rsquo;t buy outright. He&rsquo;s still fighting Ames for control of
C. and R. And I learn, too, that the Ketchim case is called for
next week. That probably means an attempt by Ames to smoke
Stolz out through Ketchim. It also means that Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames&rsquo;s
part to utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us
through her association with the Express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;where is she, Hitt? No word from her since we got
the news of the massacre at Avon this afternoon! Nothing
happened to her, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt&rsquo;s face was serious, and he did not answer. Then Carmen
herself came through the open door. Both men rose with
exclamations of gladness to welcome her. The girl&rsquo;s eyes were
wet, and her wonted smile had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hitt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want a thousand dollars to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_216' name='book4_page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I must go back to Avon to-morrow,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;And the money is for the&ndash;&ndash;the people down there.&rdquo; Her
voice caught, and her words stumbled.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other blankly. Then Hitt
reached out and took her hand. &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;about the
trouble there to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we will not talk
about evil. You&ndash;&ndash;you have the money? A thousand&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen,&rdquo;
he replied gravely. His thought was on the mortgage which he
had signed that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the
Avon bank when I get there to-morrow. I must go home now&ndash;&ndash;to
see mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;let me think about it, Carmen. Money is&ndash;&ndash;well,
won&rsquo;t less than that amount do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Hitt. Write the check now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt sighed, but made no further protest. If the Express
must founder, then this money were well spent on the stricken
people of Avon. He took out his book, and immediately wrote
the check and handed it to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hitt,&rdquo; said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he
had exhausted his protests over the size of the check, &ldquo;something&rsquo;s
killing that girl! And it isn&rsquo;t only the trouble at Avon,
either! What is it? I believe you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt shook his head. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no longer in this world, Ned.
She left it two days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Say! News about that Rinc&oacute;n fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic
remark, and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the
industrial war in progress at Avon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we coming to?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to be
the end? A social and industrial system such as ours, which
leaves the masses to starve and consume with disease under
intolerable burdens, that a handful may rot in idleness and
luxury, marks us in this latest century as hopelessly insane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is
divine justice for a majority of the people on earth to be poor
in order that a few may be rich? And how are we going to get
that perverted idea out of the minds of men? Will legislation
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Haynerd. &ldquo;Legislation arouses no faith
in me! We are suffering here because, in our immensely selfish
thought of ourselves only, we have permitted the growth of
such men as Ames, and allowed them to monopolize the country&rsquo;s
resources. Heavens! Future generations will laugh themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_217' name='book4_page_217'></a>217</span>
sick over us! Why, what sane excuse is there for permitting
the commonest necessities of life to be juggled with
by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth? How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow &lsquo;corners&rsquo;
on foodstuffs, and permit &lsquo;wheat kings&rsquo; to amass millions by
corralling the supply of grain and then raising the price to
the point where the poor washerwoman starves? Lord! We
are a nation gone mad! The existence of poverty in a country
like America is not only proof positive that our social system
is rotten to the core, but that our religion is equally so! As a
people we deserve to be incarcerated in asylums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A considerable peroration, Ned,&rdquo; smiled Hitt. &ldquo;And yet,
one that I can not refute. The only hope I see is in a radical
change in the mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class&ndash;&ndash;and
yet they are the very worst offenders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Doesn&rsquo;t the militia exist for men like Ames? To-day&rsquo;s
work at Avon proves it, I think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently so, Ned,&rdquo; returned Hitt sadly. &ldquo;And the only
possibility of a change in enlightened people is through a better
understanding of what is really good and worth while. That
means real, practical Christianity. And of that Ames knows
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to
realize that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity
have scarcely even begun to cleanse society. What do you
suppose Borwell thinks, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind&rsquo;s moral nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of
criminal business men who have had the misfortune to amass
a million dollars! And, more, they actually hold such men up
as patterns for the youth to emulate! As if the chief end of
endeavor were to achieve the glorious manhood of an Ames!
And he a man who is deader than the corpses he made at Avon
to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s ideal, my friend, has long been the man who
succeeds in everything except that which is worth while,&rdquo; replied
Hitt. &ldquo;But we have been bidden to come out from the
world, and be separate. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&ndash;&ndash;e&ndash;&ndash;s, of course. But I can&rsquo;t take my thought from
Avon&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;look at us! The Express stands for righteousness.
And now we are a dead duck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned? Go
seek work elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_218' name='book4_page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!
Your words are an offense to me, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back. &ldquo;Ned,
old man! You&rsquo;re a jewel! Things do look very dark for us,
if we look only with the human sense of vision. But we are
trying to look at the invisible things within. And there is only
perfection there. Come, we must get to work. The Express
still lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Carmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt turned and faced him. &ldquo;Ned, Carmen is not in our
hands. She is now completely with her God. We must henceforth
wait on Him.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon
mill hands crept past the guards and met in Father Danny&rsquo;s
Mission, down in the segregated vice district. They met there
because they dared not go through the town to the Hall. Father
Danny was with them. He had slipped into town the preceding
night, and remained in hiding through the day. And Carmen
was with them, too. She had gone first to the Hall, and then to
the Mission, when she arrived again in the little town. And
after she had deposited Hitt&rsquo;s check in the bank she had asked
Father Danny to call together some of the older and more intelligent
of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.</p>
<p>Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from
Ames to apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace. The
hush of death lay over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood
aghast at their own bloody work of the day before. Carmen had
avoided the main thoroughfares, and had made her way unrecognized.
At a distance she saw the town jail, heavily
guarded. Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms,
and placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down
at the slightest threatening gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come, Miss Carmen!&rdquo; whispered Father Danny, after
he had quietly greeted the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s come! It may be the
beginning of the great revolution we&rsquo;ve all known wasn&rsquo;t far
off! I just <i>had</i> to get back here! They can only arrest me,
anyway. And, oh, God! my poor, poor people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands. But
soon he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;No time for mollycoddling!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;Come, men, we&rsquo;ll give you checks, and do you get
food for the babies. Only, don&rsquo;t buy of the company stores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to, Father,&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous
not to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_219' name='book4_page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve never taken cash from you there, ye know.
Only your pay scrip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, Father, and they&rsquo;ve discounted that ten per cent each
time. But if we bought at other stores we were discharged.
And now we&rsquo;d be blacklisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God, that&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest. &ldquo;But now
then, Miss Carmen, we&rsquo;ll begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest
handed them out to the eager laborers. They worked feverishly,
for they knew that at any moment they might be apprehended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you men!&rdquo; cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain
himself. &ldquo;Did ye but know that this grand nation is
wholly dependent on such as you, its common people! Not on
the rich, I say, the handful that own its mills and mines, but
on you who work them for your rich masters! But then, ye&rsquo;re
so ignorant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Father!&rdquo; pleaded Carmen, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t! They have suffered
so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, lass, it&rsquo;s but love that I&rsquo;m dealin&rsquo; out to &rsquo;em, God
knows! And yet, it&rsquo;s they that are masters of the situation,
only they don&rsquo;t know it! There&rsquo;s the pity! They&rsquo;ve no leaders,
except such as waste their money and leave &rsquo;em in the ditch!
The world&rsquo;s social schemes, Miss Carmen, don&rsquo;t reach such as
these. They&rsquo;re only sops. And they&rsquo;ve got the contempt of
the wage-earners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hesitate, Miss Carmen. You mean, if we didn&rsquo;t give
all our thought to the rich, eh? But still, it&rsquo;s wholly up to the
people themselves, after all. And, mark me, when they do rise,
why, such men as Ames won&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s hit &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a
squad of soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.</p>
<p>Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them. The mill
hands stood like stone images, their faces black with suppressed
rage. The lieutenant halted his men, and then advanced
to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?&rdquo; he demanded
rudely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am she,&rdquo; replied the fearless girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; he said in a rough voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she will not!&rdquo; cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling
the girl back and thrusting himself before her.</p>
<p>The lieutenant raised his hand. The soldiers advanced.
The mill hands quickly formed about the girl. And then, with
a yell of rage, they threw themselves upon the soldiers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_220' name='book4_page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam. The
crazed strikers fought without weapons, except such as they
could wrest from the soldiers. But they fought to the death.
One of them seized Carmen and threw her beneath the table at
which she had been working. Above her raged the desperate
conflict. The shouting and cursing might have been heard for
blocks around. Father Danny stood in front of the table, beneath
which lay the girl. He strove desperately to maintain
his position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically
calling to the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape
by the back door.</p>
<p>In the midst of the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> a soldier mounted a chair near
the door and raised his rifle. The shot roared out, and Father
Danny pitched forward to the floor. Another shot, and still
another followed in quick succession. The strikers fell back.
Confusion seized them. Then they turned and fled precipitately
through the rear exit.</p>
<p>The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and
out through the door. Then, assembling his men, he gave an
order, and they marched away with her up the icy street to
the town jail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>
</div>
<p>With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about
him, J. Wilton Ames sat at his rich desk far above the
scampering human ants in the streets below and contemplated
the fell work of his own hands. And often and
anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out upon
his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry. In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their
shrieking, red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon. He
was not a coward, this man! But he had pushed that basket
around the desk out of his sight, for when he looked at it
something rose before him that sent a chill to his very soul.
At times his vision blurred; and then he passed his hands
heavily across his eyes. He had chanced to read in the grewsome
accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last
agonies. And the reports had said that great, red-dripping
holes had been ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful
&ldquo;dum-dum&rdquo; bullets. God! Why had he used them? And why
had the demoniac soldiers down there blown the brains from
harmless women and helpless babes? He really had not intended
to go so far!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_221' name='book4_page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>And yet, he had! Curse them! The brats would have
grown up to oppose the vested privileges of the rich! They, too,
would have become anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the
huge industrial fabric which such as he had so laboriously
erected under the legal protection afforded their sacred rights!
He had done well to remove them now! And the great captains
of industry would thank him for the example he had thus
fearlessly set!</p>
<p>To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of
blood. And yet his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with
thoughts of a wholly different stamp; with those strange
emotions which he had felt when in Carmen&rsquo;s presence; with
those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not fought them
back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But the remembrance maddened him. His face grew black,
and his mouth poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and
threats upon her and upon those who stood with her. His rage
towered again. He smote the desk with his great fist. He
fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from its throne, and bade
the Furies again become his counselors.</p>
<p>Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which
Hitt had signed. He had bought the mortgage from the bank
which had loaned the Express the money. He would crush
that sheet now, crush it until the ink dripped black from its
emasculated pages! And when it fell into his hands, he would
turn it into the yellowest of sensational journals, and hoot
the memory of its present staff from ocean to ocean!</p>
<p>Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering
if he might not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage,
and turn its occupants into the street. Ah, what a power was
money! It was the lever by which he moved the world, and
clubbed its dull-witted inhabitants into servile obeisance! Who
could stand against him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>That girl!</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and called Hood. That obedient lackey
hastened into his master&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ketchim trial?&rdquo; snarled Ames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called for this week, sir,&rdquo; replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! The&ndash;&ndash;that girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I&rsquo;ll see
that his federal appointment is killed, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rely upon him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and
utter contempt. For Hood stood before him a resplendent example
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_222' name='book4_page_222'></a>222</span>
of the influence of the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious
lure of money. Soul and body he had prostituted himself
and his undoubted talents to it. And now, were he to be
turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink into oblivion,
squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers
had always itched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Cass defend Ketchim?&rdquo; the master asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, doubtless. He knows most about the formation of the
defunct Simit&iacute; company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, see him and&ndash;&ndash;you say he&rsquo;s young, and got a wife and
baby? Offer him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t do, sir,&rdquo; returned Hood, shaking his
head dubiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had men talking with him regarding the
trial, and he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get him over here. I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t persuade him,&rdquo;
growled Ames in an ugly tone.</p>
<p>Hood bowed and went out. A few minutes later Reverend
Darius Borwell was ushered into the financier&rsquo;s private
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; cried that gentleman of the cloth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands
have drawn upon themselves down in Avon! Goodness! And
four members of the Church of the Social Revolution came to
my study last evening and demanded that I let them speak to
my congregation on the coming Sabbath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I told them certainly not! My church is God&rsquo;s
house! And I shall have policemen stationed at the doors
next Sunday to maintain order! To think that it has come to
this in America! But, Mr. Ames, is your house guarded? I
would advise&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without
ringing a series of electric bells,&rdquo; replied Ames evenly. &ldquo;I have
fifty guards and private detectives in attendance in and about
my premises all the time. My limousine has been lined with
sheet steel. And my every step is protected. I am not afraid
for my life. I simply want to keep going until I can carry out
a few plans I have in hand.&rdquo; His thought had reverted again
to the fair girl in the Tombs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, Borwell,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I want to talk with you
about another matter. I am drawing up my will, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear Mr. Ames! You are not ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames thought of his physician&rsquo;s constantly iterated warning;
but shook his head. &ldquo;I may get caught in this Avon affair,&rdquo;
he said evasively. &ldquo;And I want to be prepared. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_223' name='book4_page_223'></a>223</span>
President has sent his message to Congress, as you may be
aware. There are unpleasant suggestions in it regarding dispossession
in cases like my own. I&rsquo;m coming back by magnanimously
willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the clergyman. Great was Mammon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum
that I am setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice,&rdquo;
continued Ames, eying the minister narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; cried that worthy gentleman, springing
up and clasping the financier&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Mr. Ames! So
magnanimous! Ah&ndash;&ndash;the amount?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will half a million do?&rdquo; suggested Ames.</p>
<p>The minister reflected a moment. One should not be too
precipitate in accepting tentative benefactions. &ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;we
really should have&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;a trifle more, Mr. Ames. There&rsquo;s the
settlement home, and the commons, you know, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, we&rsquo;ll start with half a million,&rdquo; replied
Ames dryly. &ldquo;By the way, you know Jurges, eh? Reverend
William Jurges? Er&ndash;&ndash;have you any particular influence with
him, if I may ask?&rdquo; His sharp eyes bored straight through the
wondering divine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;yes, I know the gentleman. And, as for influence&ndash;&ndash;well,
I may&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just so,&rdquo; put in Ames. &ldquo;Now there is a trial coming
up this week, and Jurges will be called to the stand. I want
you to give him the true facts in regard to it. I&rsquo;ll call Hood,
and we&rsquo;ll go over them in detail now. Then you see Jurges
this afternoon, and&ndash;&ndash;say, he&rsquo;s raising a building fund too, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the
trio discussed the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip
O. Ketchim. Then Ames dismissed the clergyman, and bade
his office boy admit the young lawyer, Cass, who had come in
response to Hood&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood
regarding him, studying what manner of man he was, and how
best to approach him. Then he opened the conversation by a
casual reference to the unsatisfactory business situation which
obtained throughout the country, and expressed wonder that
young men just starting in their professions managed to make
ends meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he concluded with deep significance, &ldquo;better go hungry
than take on any class of business which, though promising
good money returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal.&rdquo;
He looked hard at the young lawyer when he paused.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_224' name='book4_page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you, Mr. Ames,&rdquo; returned Cass. &ldquo;But as
I am particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have
sent for me? Have you anything that I can&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; abruptly interrupted the financier. &ldquo;We need additions
to our legal staff. I thought perhaps you might like to
talk over the matter with me, with a view to entering our employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Ames, I&ndash;&ndash;I have never thought of&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The young
man&rsquo;s eyes glistened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you think of it now,&rdquo; said Ames, smiling
graciously. &ldquo;I have heard considerable about you of late, and
I must say I rather like the way you have been handling your
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cass looked at him with rising wonder. The work which
he had been doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and
called for no display of legal skill whatever. Suspicions slowly
began to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your
career, Mr. Cass, that would bring discredit upon you. And I
am afraid your association with Ketchim is going to do just
that. But possibly you do not intend to handle further business
for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length
secured bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his
uncle, Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames. And, because of his
loyal efforts in behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass
be retained as counsel for the latter when his trial should come
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Mr. Cass,&rdquo; said Ames suddenly.
&ldquo;Mr. Hood will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand
to start with. We&rsquo;ll try you out for a few weeks. Then, if we
don&rsquo;t mutually fit, why, we&rsquo;ll quietly separate and say nothing.
How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cass thought hard. Half of that salary would have looked
large to him then. But&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; he slowly said in reply, &ldquo;what class of work
Mr. Hood would give me to start with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are
getting into the harness. Possibly court work, as a starter.
You&rsquo;ve had experience in that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cass reflected again. The temptation was tremendous.
That little house which he had passed and stopped to look at
so wistfully every night on his way home was now within his
grasp.</p>
<p>He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before
him. Then he thought suddenly of Avon. Then of Carmen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_225' name='book4_page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I enter your employ, it must be with
the stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim
trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames&rsquo;s face went suddenly dark. &ldquo;If you enter my employ,
sir, it will be with the stipulation that you do as I say,&rdquo; he
returned coldly.</p>
<p>And then the young lawyer saw through the mask. And
his anger flamed high at what he discerned behind it. He rose
and faced the great man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have made a mistake. I am poor,
and I need business. But I have not as yet fallen so completely
under the spell of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a
man like you! To enter your employ, I now see, would mean
the total loss of character and self respect. It would mean a
lowering of my ideals, whatever they may be, to your own
vulgar standard. I may have done wrong in becoming associated
with Mr. Ketchim. In fact, I know that I have. But I
pledged myself to assist him. And yet, in doing so, I scarcely
can blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to
become your legal henchman. I want wealth. But there are
some terms upon which even I can not accept it. And your
terms are among them. I bid you good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out. Summoning
Hood, he vented his great wrath upon that individual&rsquo;s bald
pate. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I want that fellow Cass so
wound up that he will sneak off to a lonely spot and commit
suicide! And if you can&rsquo;t do it, then I&rsquo;ll accept your resignation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Hood. &ldquo;And, by the way, Mr.
Ames, I have just learned that Judge Harris, father of the
young man who came up with that girl, is in Colombia. Seems
that he&rsquo;s taken some wealthy man down there to look at La
Libertad mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Ames&rsquo;s eyes snapped fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of
Monsignor Lafelle, and so they&rsquo;ve gone down to get titles to
that mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By G&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they say that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what they say!&rdquo; roared Ames. &ldquo;Cable Wenceslas
at once to see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.
He has ways of accomplishing that. Humph! Fools!
Judge Harris, eh? Ninny! I guess Wenceslas can block his
little game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with
rage, and a slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_226' name='book4_page_226'></a>226</span>
turned to the lavatory. And as he walked, Hood thought his
left foot dragged slightly. But the lawyer made no comment.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim
trial, which has gone down in history as containing the most
spectacular <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> in the record of legal procedure in the
New World. Had it been concerned, as was anticipated, only
with routine legal procedure against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled
compound of feeble sycophancy and low morals, it would
have attracted slight attention, and would have been spread
upon the court records by uninterested clerks with never a
second thought. But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.
Into it converged threads which now may be traced back to
scenes and events in three continents; threads whose intricate
windings led through trackless forest and dim-lit church;
through court of fashion and hut of poverty; back through the
dark mazes of mortal thought, where no light shines upon the
carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind; back even to
the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne of the
Old World.</p>
<p>But none of these elements found expression in the indictment
against the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man
who had sought to imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who
lacked sufficient intelligence of that sort which manifests in
such a perversion of skill and power. Ames was a tremendous
corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply because of
the elemental fact that he himself made those laws. Ketchim
was a plain deceiver. And his deception was religious fervor.
Mingling his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy
alliance for the purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended
his prayer meetings and commented with bated breath
upon his beautiful showing of religious zeal. He was but one
of a multitude afflicted with the &ldquo;dollar mania.&rdquo; His misfortune
was that his methods were so antique that they could
not long fail of detection. And it was because of his use of
the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim <i>et al.</i> by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.</p>
<p>Nominally the people&rsquo;s interests were in the hands of the
Public Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named
Ellis. But, as that gentleman owed his appointment to Ames,
it is not surprising that at his right hand sat Hood and his
well trained staff. Nominally, too, Judge Spencer conducted the
trial strictly upon its merits, not all of which lay with the people.
But the judge might have been still prosecuting petty cases
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_227' name='book4_page_227'></a>227</span>
back in the unknown little district from which he came, had
it not been for the great influence of Ames, long since, who had
found him on a certain occasion useful. And so the jury panel
contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were
amenable to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow
gold. And only those points of evidence were sustained which
conduced to the incrimination of the miserable defendant.
Ketchim was doomed before the trial began.</p>
<p>And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to
lengthen the period of torture to which his victims should be
subjected, the trial was dragged through many days. Besides,
even he and his hirelings were bound to observe the formalities.</p>
<p>It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been
made to procure bail for Carmen after her arrest. The dramatic
may always be relied upon to carry a point which even plain
evidence negatives. And she, acquiescing in the suggestion,
remained a full two weeks in the Tombs before Ames&rsquo;s eager
counsel found their opportunity to confront her on the witness
stand and besmirch her with their black charges. The Beaubien
was prostrated. But, knowing that for her another hour
of humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to
summon her strength for its advent. Father Waite toiled with
Cass day and night. Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources,
pursued their way, grim and silent. The Express was
sinking beneath its mountainous load. And they stood at the
helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an iota to offers
of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy upon
which the paper had been launched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going down, Hitt,&rdquo; said Haynerd grimly. &ldquo;But we
go with the flag flying at the mast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Hitt answered not. He was learning to know as did
Carmen, and to see with eyes which were invisible.</p>
<p>It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long
days of petty wrangling and childish recrimination among the
opposing lawyers, that Stolz came to Ames and laid down his
sword. The control of C. and R. should pass unequivocally to
the latter if he would but save Ketchim from prison.</p>
<p>Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his
great triumph. C. and R! Poof! He would send Stolz&rsquo; nephew
to prison, and then roll a bomb along Wall Street whose detonation
would startle the financial world clean out of its orbit!
Stolz had failed to notice that Ames&rsquo;s schemes had so signally
worked out that C. and R. was practically in his hands now!
The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of the
Ames office purple with rage. And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless
nephew.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_228' name='book4_page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a
process of justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single
man&rsquo;s long nurtured personal animosities. The adulterous
union of religion and business was only nominally before the
bar. The victims, not the defendant only, not the preachers, the
washerwomen, the factory girls, the widows, and the orphans,
whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into his net by the lure
of pious benedictions, but rather those unfortunates who had
chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the great, legalized
malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish caprice, and
whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public would
now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.</p>
<p>The prosecution scored from the beginning. Doctor Jurges,
utterly confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring
to follow the dictates of his conscience, while attempting to
reconcile them with his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave
testimony which fell little short of incriminating himself. For
there were produced letters which he had written to members
of his congregation, and which for subtlety and deception,
though doubtless innocently done, would have made a seasoned
promoter look sharp to his own laurels.</p>
<p>Then Harris was called. He had been summoned from
Denver for the trial. But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage
to either side. And then&ndash;&ndash;crowning blunder!&ndash;&ndash;Cass
permitted Ketchim himself to take the stand. And the frightened,
trembling broker gave his own cause such a blow that
the prosecution might well have asked the judge to take the
case from the jury then and there. It was a legal <i>faux pas</i>;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.</p>
<p>Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.
Could not that sorrowing woman have given testimony
which would have aided the tottering defense, and unmasked
the evil genius which presided over this mock trial? Ah, yes, in
abundance! But not one point would the judge sustain when
it bordered upon forbidden territory. It was made plain to
her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to permit
the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court
room upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and
low insinuations.</p>
<p>But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simit&iacute; company&rsquo;s
affairs had come through another person.</p>
<p>And who might that be?</p>
<p>Mr. J. Wilton Ames.</p>
<p>Ah! But Mr. Ames should give his own testimony&ndash;&ndash;for
was it not he who had, not long since, legally punished the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_229' name='book4_page_229'></a>229</span>
witness on a charge of defamation of character? The witness
was dismissed. And the spectators knew that it was because
the righteous prosecution could no longer stain its hands with
one who bore such a tarnished name as she.</p>
<p>And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged
woman burst into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there
before the court room crowded with eager society ladies and
curious, non-toiling men. Flayed him as men are seldom
flayed and excoriated by the women they trample. The bailiffs
seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge broke
his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle
with seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien
be returned to the stand.</p>
<p>The astonished judge hesitated. Cass stood his ground. He
turned to the people, as if seeking their support. A great murmur
arose through the court room. The judge looked down at
Ames. That man, sitting calm and unimpassioned, nodded his
head slightly. And the woman was led back to the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your
Honor!&rdquo; cried the young lawyer for the defense. &ldquo;Mr. Ames
is to take the stand as an important witness in this case. If
Madam Beaubien brings such a charge against him, it gives us
reason to believe his honor peccable, and his testimony open
to suspicion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and
held its breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I object, Your Honor!&rdquo; shouted the chief prosecutor, Ellis.
&ldquo;The lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court! Madam
Beaubien has been shown to be a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objection is sustained!&rdquo; called the judge. &ldquo;The charge
is utterly irrelevant! Order in the court!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;His first wife&rsquo;s portrait&ndash;&ndash;is in a glass window&ndash;&ndash;in his
yacht!&rdquo;</i> cried the hysterical Beaubien. Then she crumpled up
in a limp mass, and was led from the chair half fainting.</p>
<p>At the woman&rsquo;s shrill words a white-haired man, dressed
in black, clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the
room close to the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.
At his feet reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.
Evidently he had but just arrived from distant lands.</p>
<p>Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.
Then Cass, believing that the psychological moment had
arrived, loudly called Carmen Ariza to the stand. The dramatic
play must be continued, now that it had begun. The battle
which had raged back and forth for long, weary days, could be
won, if at all, only by playing upon the emotions of the jury,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_230' name='book4_page_230'></a>230</span>
for the evidence thus far given had resulted in showing not
only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who had
been associated with the Simit&iacute; company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.</p>
<p>The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely
neglected by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned
that she must be called by the defense. Then would he bring
up the prostitute, Jude, and from her wring testimony which
must blast forever the girl&rsquo;s already soiled name. Following
her, he would himself take the stand, and tell of the girl&rsquo;s visits
to his office; of her protestations of love for him; of her embracing
him; and of a thousand indiscretions which he had
carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant occasion.</p>
<p>But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which
the case seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment,
then Ames&rsquo;s face, and then abruptly adjourned court until the
following day. Yet not until Cass had been recognized, and the
hounded girl summoned from her cell in the Tombs, to take the
stand in the morning for&ndash;&ndash;her life!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>
</div>
<p>In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the
world to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind&rsquo;s
iniquity to the surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy
the foul germs, there shall be old men and women, and they
which, looking up from their work, peep and mutter of strange
things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly silent when they
have told again of the fair young girl who walked alone into
the crowded court room that cold winter&rsquo;s morning. And their
stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.</p>
<p>Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience,
had fallen back and allowed her to enter alone. The buzz of
subdued chatter ceased, and a great silence came over all as
they looked. Some swore, in awed whispers, when the dramatic
day had ended, and judge and jury and wrangling lawyer had
silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet and thoughtful each
to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful head when
she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.
Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly
things; and that a heavenly presence moved beside her. Nor
may we lightly set aside these tales; for, after the curtain had
fallen upon the wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_231' name='book4_page_231'></a>231</span>
not one present who would deny that, as the girl came into the
great room and went directly to the witness chair, God himself
walked at her side and held her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be
thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever
thou goest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the
clerical garb ran these words as he watched the girl move silently
across the room. She seemed to have taken on a new
meaning to him since the previous day. And as he looked, his
eyes grew moist, and he drew out his handkerchief.</p>
<p>But his were not the only eyes that had filled then. Hitt
and Haynerd bent their heads, that the people might not see;
Miss Wall and the Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt
to stay their grief; Jude buried her head in her hands, and
rocked back and forth, moaning softly. Why they wept, they
knew not. A welter of conflicting emotions surged through
their harassed souls. They seemed to have come now to the
great crisis. And which way the tide would turn rested with
this lone girl.</p>
<p>For some moments after she was seated the silence remained
unbroken. And as she sat there, waiting, she looked
down at the man who sought to destroy what he might not possess.
Some said afterward that as she looked at him she
smiled. Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled down
from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?</p>
<p>But Ames did not meet her glance. Somehow he dared not.
He was far from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous
mood possessed him. And yet, judged by the world&rsquo;s standards,
he had tipped the crest of success. He had conquered all. Men
came and went at his slightest nod. His coffers lay bursting
with their heavy treasure. He was swollen with wealth, with
material power, with abnormal pride. His tender sensibilities
and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he was
stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world. Not
a single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had
been met. Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden
crosses over the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence;
and in them, despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying
sense of his own great might.</p>
<p>The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.
She looked at him for a moment, and then smiled. &ldquo;I will
tell the truth,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge. But the
latter sat with his eyes fixed upon the girl. The clerk did not
press the point; and Carmen was delivered into the hands of
the lawyers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_232' name='book4_page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>Cass hesitated. He knew not how to begin. Then, yielding
to a sudden impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the
place of her birth, her parentage, and other statistical data,
leading up to her association with the defendant.</p>
<p>The story that followed was simply given. It was but the
one she had told again and again. Yet the room hung on her
every word. And when she had concluded, Cass turned her
back again to Simit&iacute;, and to Rosendo&rsquo;s share in the mining
project which had ultimated in this suit.</p>
<p>A far-away look came into the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she spoke of
that great, black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo
into his own warm heart. There were few dry eyes among the
spectators when she told of his selfless love. And when she
drew the portrait of him, standing alone in the cold mountain
water, far up in the jungle of Guamoc&oacute;, bending over the laden
<i>batea</i>, and toiling day by day in those ghastly solitudes, that
she might be protected and educated and raised above her
primitive environment in Simit&iacute;, there were sobs heard throughout
the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly
cleared his throat as he wiped them.</p>
<p>Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.
His lawyer at length rose to object to the recital on the ground
that it was largely irrelevant to the case. And the judge, pulling
himself together, sustained the objection. Cass sat down. Then
the prosecution eagerly took up the cross-examination. Ames&rsquo;s
hour had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not
what a day may bring forth,&rdquo; murmured the white-haired man
in the clerical garb far back in the crowded room. Had he
learned the law of Truth to error, &ldquo;Thou shall surely die&rdquo;?
Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the rich man&rsquo;s vitals?
Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so insolently
flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and his
mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom
of heaven even here upon earth?</p>
<p>Ames leaned over to whisper to Hood. The latter drew
Ellis down and transmitted his master&rsquo;s instructions. The
atmosphere grew tense, and the hush of expectancy lay over
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; began Ellis easily, &ldquo;your parentage has
been a matter of some dispute, if I mistake not, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cass was on his feet to object. What had this question to
do with the issue?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_233' name='book4_page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>But the judge overruled the objection. That was what he
was there for. Cass should have divined it by this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses.
&ldquo;And your father, it is said, was a negro priest. I believe that
has been accepted for some time. A certain Diego, if I recall
correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew my earthly father,&rdquo; replied Carmen in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego,
have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been,&rdquo; returned the girl, looking off absently
toward the high windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he not claim you as his daughter?&rdquo; pursued the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Ellis, &ldquo;that being reasonably settled, is it
not also true that you used the claim of possessing this mine,
La Libertad, as a pretext for admission to society here in New
York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.
He, too, had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a
great sympathy for him in his awful mesmerism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?&rdquo; went on
the merciless lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer!&rdquo; admonished the judge, looking severely down
upon the silent girl.</p>
<p>Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.
She was weary, oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery. And
yet she was there to prove her God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ask this further question,&rdquo; Ellis resumed,
without waiting for her reply. &ldquo;Were you not at one time in
a resort conducted by Madam Cazeau, down on&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short. The girl&rsquo;s eyes were looking straight
into his, and they seemed to have pierced his soul. &ldquo;I am
sorry for you,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;oh, so sorry! Yes, I was once
in that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his
head in shame. He turned to Hood. But Hood would not look
at him. Ames alone met his embarrassed glance, and sent
back a command to continue the attack.</p>
<p>Cass again rose and voiced his protest. What possible relation
to the issue involved could such testimony have? But
the judge bade him sit down, as the counsel for the prosecution
doubtless was bringing out facts of greatest importance.</p>
<p>Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome
task. &ldquo;Now, Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite
the mill hands at Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_234' name='book4_page_234'></a>234</span>
that as part of a consistent line of attack upon Mr.
Ames, in which you were aiding others from whom you took
your orders. May I ask you to cite the motives upon which you
acted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cass sank back in abject despair. Ketchim was being forgotten!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not attacked Mr. Ames,&rdquo; she slowly replied, &ldquo;but
only the things he stands for. But you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellis smiled superciliously. &ldquo;A militant brand of social
uplift, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Ellis, but just Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m. And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply
to industrial troubles, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity,&rdquo;
she said gently. &ldquo;Not the burlesque Christianity of our
countless sects and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not
Protestantism; nor any of the fads and fancies of the human
mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus of Nazareth, who knew
that the human man was not God&rsquo;s image, but only stood for
it in the mortal consciousness. And he always saw behind this
counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God. And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming
time, Miss Ariza!&rdquo; interrupted the judge sternly.</p>
<p>Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his
daily walk and words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ariza!&rdquo; again commanded the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the girl went calmly on, &ldquo;Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the
human hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the &lsquo;Who
shall be greatest?&rsquo; of human institutions. Nor did he make evil
a reality, as mortals do. He knew it seemed awfully real to the
deceived human consciousness; but he told that consciousness
to be not afraid. And then he went to work and drove out the
belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness and its total lack
of principle. The orthodox churches and sects of to-day do
not do that. Oh, no! They strive for world dominion! Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors. Their tenets
shame the intelligence of thinking men! Yet they have slain
tens of millions to establish them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could the Court do? To remove the girl meant depriving
Ames of his prey. But if she remained upon the stand,
she would put them all to confusion, for they had no means of
silencing her. The judge looked blankly at Ames; his hands
were tied.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_235' name='book4_page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing
another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been working for God,&rdquo; she interrupted. Her voice
was low and steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men
are not wont to see in those of their neighbors. &ldquo;I have not
been working for men. He alone is my employer. And for
Him I am here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the
prosecution. Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.
The defense had passed from his hands.</p>
<p>At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant,
thinking to relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible
voice to one of his wonted witticisms. All turned to look at
him. But the effect was not what he had anticipated. No one
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Mr. Ketchim!&rdquo; roared the exasperated
judge, bending far over his desk. &ldquo;You are just a smart little
fool!&rdquo; And the elder Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage,
for he saw significant movements among the jury, &ldquo;do
you not think the unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that
you have allied yourself with those who oppose the nation&rsquo;s
industrial progress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen sat silent. Order had now been restored in the
court room, and Ellis was feeling sure of himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have opposed the constructive development of our
country&rsquo;s resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like
Mr. Ames, for example, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words
that fell upon the room like masses of lead. &ldquo;I stand opposed
to any man, Mr. Ellis, who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose
of revenge, spreads the boll weevil in the cotton fields of
the South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dull silence descended upon the place. And yet it was a
silence that fell crashing upon Ames&rsquo;s straining ears. He sat
for a moment stunned; then sprang to his feet. All eyes were
turned upon him. He held out a hand, and made as if to
speak; then sank again into his chair.</p>
<p>Ellis stood as if petrified. Then Hood rose and whispered to
him. Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which
Miss Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent
as a witness. We therefore dismiss her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cass had leaped to the floor. &ldquo;Your Honor!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I should like to examine the witness further!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_236' name='book4_page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She is dismissed!&rdquo; returned the judge, glowering over his
spectacles at the young lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stand on&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; the judge bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen!&rdquo; called Cass through the rising tumult, &ldquo;the
lawyer for the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his
low references to your parentage. Will you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his
broken gavel. Then he summoned the bailiffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall order the room cleared!&rdquo; he called in a loud,
threatening voice.</p>
<p>The murmur subsided. The judge sat down and mopped his
steaming face. Hood and Ellis bent in whispered consultation.
Ames was a study of wild, infuriated passion. Cass stood defiantly
before the bar. Carmen sat quietly facing the crowded
room. She had reached up and was fondling the little locket
which hung at her throat. It was the first time she had ever
worn it. It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and it had never
occurred to her to wear it until that day. Nor would she have
thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the
Tombs the night before in a little box with some papers which
the girl had called for. Why she had put it on, she could not
say.</p>
<p>Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew
the slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I never&ndash;&ndash;knew my parents,&rdquo; she murmured musingly,
looking down lovingly at the little locket. Then she opened it
and sat gazing, rapt and absorbed, at the two little portraits
within. &ldquo;But there are their pictures,&rdquo; she suddenly announced,
holding the locket out to Cass.</p>
<p>It was said afterward that never in the history of legal
procedure in New York had that court room held such dead
silence as when Cass stood bending over the faces of the girl&rsquo;s
earthly parents, portrayed in the strange little locket which
Rosendo had taken from Badillo years before. Never had it
known such a tense moment; never had the very air itself
seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that
day and in that crisal hour.</p>
<p>Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass&rsquo;s shoulder
at the locket. A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned
and stared at Ames. The judge bent shaking over his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hood!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Have you ever seen those pictures
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot. His hands shook,
and his words gibbered from his trembling lips.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_237' name='book4_page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The&ndash;&ndash;the woman&rsquo;s portrait, sir&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;the one in&ndash;&ndash;in
Mr. Ames&rsquo;s yacht!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost
soul&rsquo;s despairing wail. Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning
his chair, thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the
locket. For a moment he peered wildly into it. It seemed as
if his eyes would devour it, absorb it, push themselves clean
through it, in their eagerness to grasp its meaning.</p>
<p>Then he looked up. His eyes were red; his face ashen; his
lips white. His unsteady glance met the girl&rsquo;s. His mouth
opened, and flapped like a broken shutter in the wind. His
arms swung wildly upward; then dropped heavily. Suddenly
he bent to one side; caught himself; straightened up; and
then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed to the floor.
The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through the
great room like an echo of Satan&rsquo;s plunge into the pit of hell.</p>
<p>Pandemonium broke upon the scene. Wild confusion seized
the excited spectators. They rushed forward in a mass, over
railings, over chairs and tables, heedless of all but the great
mystery that was slowly clearing away in the dim light that
winter&rsquo;s morning. Through them the white-haired man, clad
in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the locket!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let me see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore it from Hood&rsquo;s hand and scanned it eagerly. Then
he nodded his head. &ldquo;The same! The very same!&rdquo; he murmured,
trembling with excitement. Then, shouting to the
judge above the hubbub:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor! I can throw some light upon this case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd fell back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Monsignor Lafelle. I have just returned from Europe.
The woman&rsquo;s portrait in this little locket is that of Do&ntilde;a
Dolores, Infanta, daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of
Spain! And this girl,&rdquo; pointing to the bewildered Carmen,
who sat clinging to the arms of her chair, &ldquo;is her child, and is
a princess of the royal blood! Her father is the man who lies
there&ndash;&ndash;J. Wilton Ames!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 18</h2>
</div>
<p>Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great
<i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> flashed over the city, and across a startled
continent. Beneath the seas it sped, and into court and
hovel. Madrid gasped; Seville panted; and old Padre Rafa&eacute;l de
Rinc&oacute;n raised his hoary head and cackled shrilly.</p>
<p>To the seething court room came flying reporters and news
gatherers, who threw themselves despairingly against the closed
portals. Within, the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd,
and held the doors against the panic without.</p>
<p>Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with
feverish energy, but shook their heads.</p>
<p>In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried,
half dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped
in the Beaubien&rsquo;s arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.
Hitt stood guard at the door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed
about with bated breath, unable to take their eyes from the girl.</p>
<p>In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket,
and plied Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.
The excited editor&rsquo;s brain was afire; but of one thing he was
well assured, the Express would bring out an extra that night
that would scoop its rivals clean to the bone!</p>
<p>In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the
doors and admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent
out to procure chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the
man in the locket might be cleaned. Ten minutes later the
features of J. Wilton Ames stood forth clearly beside those of
the wife of his youth. The picture showed him younger in appearance,
to be sure, but the likeness was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! Lord! Monsignor, but you are slow! Come to the
point quickly! We must go to press within an hour!&rdquo; wailed
Haynerd, shaking the churchman&rsquo;s arm in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, what more?&rdquo; cried Lafelle. &ldquo;I saw the portrait in the
Royal Gallery, years ago, in Madrid. It impressed me. I
could not forget the sad, sweet face. I saw it again in the
stained-glass window in the Ames yacht. I became suspicious.
I inquired when I returned to Spain. There was much whispering,
much shaking of heads, but little information. But this I
know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a lover, a wonderful
tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja. And one day a babe was
taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills. Rumor
said that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.
Who knew? One man, perhaps: old Rafa&eacute;l de Rinc&oacute;n. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_239' name='book4_page_239'></a>239</span>
Rome suddenly recalled him from Isabella&rsquo;s court, and after
that he was very quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Ames?&rdquo; persisted Haynerd.</p>
<p>Lafelle shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;traveled
much in Europe. He went often to Spain. He bought a
vineyard in Granada&ndash;&ndash;the one from which he still procures his
wine. And there&ndash;&ndash;who knows?&ndash;&ndash;he met the Infanta. But
probably neither he nor she guessed her royal birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Good Lord! Then&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they eloped&ndash;&ndash;who knows? Whether married or not,
I can not say. But it is evident she went with him to Colombia,
where, perhaps, he was seeking a concession from Congress in
Bogot&aacute;. So far, so good. Then came the news of his father&rsquo;s
sudden death. He hastened out of the country. Possibly he
bade her wait for his return. But a prospective mother is often
excitable. She waited a day, a week&ndash;&ndash;who knows how long?
And then she set out to follow him. Alas! she was wild to do
such a thing. And it cost her life. She died at the little riverine
town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born. Is it not
plausible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above!&rdquo; cried Haynerd. &ldquo;And the girl&rsquo;s wonderful
voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori,&rdquo; Lafelle
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the portraits&ndash;&ndash;what is the name under that of Ames?
Guillermo? That is not his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William. Doubtless Ames
told her his name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name
he went by in his youth. And the nearest the Spanish could
come to it was Guillermo. Diego&rsquo;s name was Guillermo Diego
Polo. And after he had seen that name in the locket he used
it as a further means of strengthening his claim upon the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;she is&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;princess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct. Not an Inca
princess, but a princess of the reigning house of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly
from the room and tore across town to the office of the Express.</p>
<p>Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and
careening to the doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.
Gently, silently, the great body was lifted and borne below.
And then the chattering, gesticulating mob poured from the
court room, from the halls and corridors, and out into the chill
sunlight of the streets, where they formed anew into little
groups, and went over again the dramatic events but a few
minutes past.</p>
<p>Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_240' name='book4_page_240'></a>240</span>
vulgar gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine,
with the Beaubien and Hitt. Miss Wall and the gasping Jude
followed in another. The judge had bidden the girl go on her
own recognizance. The arrest at Avon; the matter of bail;
all had merged into the excitement of the hour and been forgotten.
Ketchim went out on Cass&rsquo;s arm. The judge had ordered
the clerk to enter an adjournment.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that
led up to the little Beaubien cottage. Within, the curtains were
drawn, and Sidney, Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls
that came incessantly over the telephone and to the doors. Sidney
had not been in the court room, for Haynerd had left him
at the editor&rsquo;s desk in his own absence. But with the return of
Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home. And once
through the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and
strained her to his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My own, my very own little sister!
We only pretended before, didn&rsquo;t we? But now&ndash;&ndash;now, oh, God
above! you really are my sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and
kissed him. &ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;the ways of God are
past finding out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things
of the world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to
confound the mighty; and the base things, and the things despised,
had He used to bring to naught the things that are.
And why? That no flesh might glory in His terrible presence!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo; cried the excited boy. &ldquo;Think what this means
to our book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled up at him; then turned away. &ldquo;My father!&rdquo;
she murmured. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;my father!&rdquo; she kept repeating, groping
her way about the room as if in a haze. &ldquo;He! It can&rsquo;t be!
It can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms. &ldquo;My
little princess!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oh! But who would have
dreamed it! Yet I called you that from the very first. But&ndash;&ndash;oh,
Carmen! And he&ndash;&ndash;that man&ndash;&ndash;your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Mother, don&rsquo;t! It&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t proved. It&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Beaubien&rsquo;s heart almost stopped. What if it were
true? What, then, would this sudden turn in the girl&rsquo;s life
mean to the lone woman who clung to her so?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother dearest,&rdquo; whispered Carmen, looking up
through her tears. &ldquo;For even if it should be true, I will not
leave you. He&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_241' name='book4_page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>She stopped; and would speak of him no more.</p>
<p>But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous
Fifth Avenue palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded
bronze doors, at which an eager crowd stood staring, Ames,
the superman, lay dying, his left side, from the shoulder down,
paralyzed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist
rose, and the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.
And then through the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang
a piercing cry. For when he awoke, the curtain stood raised
upon his life; and the sight of its ghastly content struck wild
terror to his naked soul.</p>
<p>He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist
was rising. He thought he had been toiling with feverish energy
through those black hours, building a wall about the things
that were his. And into the design of the huge structure he
had fitted the trophies of his conquest. Gannette toiled with
him, straining, sweating, groaning. Together they reared that
monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man plotted the death
of his companion when the work should be done, lest he ask
for pay. And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls. These were the children of Avon who had never played.
And over the great stones which they heaved into place they
sketched red dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.
A soft wind swept over the rising structure, and it bore a gentle
voice: &ldquo;I am Love.&rdquo; But the toilers looked up and cursed.
&ldquo;Let us alone!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;Love is weakness!&rdquo; And over
the rim of the wall looked fair faces. &ldquo;We are Truth, we are
Life!&rdquo; But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls at
the faces, and bade them begone! A youth and a tender girl
looked down at the sweating toilers. &ldquo;We ask help; we are
young, and times are so hard!&rdquo; But the great man pointed to
himself. &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I need no help! Begone!&rdquo;
And then the darkness settled down, for the wall was now so
high that it shut out the sun. And the great man howled with
laughter; the wall was done. So he turned and smote his companion
unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.</p>
<p>But the darkness was heavy. The man grew lonely. And
then he sought to mount the wall. But his hands slipped on
the human blood of the red, slimy dollar-marks, and he fell
crashing back among his tinkling treasures. He rose, and tried
again. The naked, splitting skulls leered at him. The toothless
jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets glowed eerily. The
man raised his voice. He begged that a rope be lowered. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_242' name='book4_page_242'></a>242</span>
would go out once more into the sunlit world. But the chill
wind brought him only despairing moans.</p>
<p>Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his
bare hands. It mocked him with the strength which he had
given it. He turned and tore his hair and flesh. He gnashed his
teeth until they broke into bits. He cursed; he raved; he
pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for freedom. But the
skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the blood on
the stones dripped upon his burning head. And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his
death, that they might throw down the wall and take away his
treasure.</p>
<p>And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to
horror; his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against
the prison which he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and
broken. And as he fell, he heard the shrill cackle of demons
that danced their hellish steps on the top of the wall. Then
the Furies flew down and bound him tight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my God,
What might I not have made of Thy fair world
Had I but loved Thy highest creature here?
It was my duty to have loved the highest;
It surely was my profit had I known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He awoke from his terror, dripping. He feebly lifted his
head. Then he sought to raise his arms, to move. He was
alive! And then the scream tore from his dry throat. His
great body was half dead!</p>
<p>The attendants flew to his couch. The physicians bent over
him and sought to soothe his mental agony. The man&rsquo;s torture
was fearful to behold; his weakness, pitiable. He sank
again into somnolence. But the sleep was one of unbroken
horror; and those in the room stopped in the course of their
duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their hands to
their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.</p>
<p>Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his
crowded life. Now he was wading through muddy slums where
stood the wretched houses which he rented for immoral purposes.
He was madly searching for something. What could
it be? Ah, yes, his girl! Some one had said she was there.
Who was it? Aye, who but himself? But he found her not.
And he wept bitterly.</p>
<p>And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those
fresh graves&ndash;&ndash;dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great
heaps behind him. And into the face of each corpse as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_243' name='book4_page_243'></a>243</span>
dragged it out of its damp bed he peered eagerly. But with
awful moans he threw them from him in turn, for she was not
there.</p>
<p>Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and
there he roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name. And
the wild beasts and the hissing serpents looked out at him from
the thick bush, looked with great, red eyes, and then fled from
him with loathing. And, suddenly, he came upon another
mound near the banks of a great river. And over it stood a
rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim, penciled word,
<i>Dolores</i>. Ah, God! how he cried out for the oblivion that was
not his. But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down
into eternal blackness filled with dying men&rsquo;s groans!</p>
<p>The awful day drew to a close. The exhausted attendants
stood about the bed with bated breath. The physicians had
called Doctor Morton in consultation, for the latter was a brain
specialist. And while they sat gazing at the crazed, stricken
giant, hopelessly struggling to lift the inert mass of his dead
body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered. He bowed silently to
them all; then went to the bedside and took the patient&rsquo;s hand.
A moment later he turned to the physicians and nurses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us ask God&rsquo;s help for Mr. Ames,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>
<p>They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long
and earnestly; prayed that the loving Father who had made
man in His image would take pity on the suffering one who
lay there, and, if it be His will, spare him for Jesus&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some
moments. Then Doctor Morton&rsquo;s heavy voice broke the silence
of death. &ldquo;Mr. Borwell,&rdquo; he said in awful earnestness, extending
his hand toward the bed, &ldquo;cure that man, if your religion
is anything more than a name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister&rsquo;s face;
but he did not reply. Doctor Morton turned to the physicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;Mr. Ames, I think, is past
our aid. There is nothing on earth that can save him. If he
lives, he will be hopelessly insane.&rdquo; He hesitated, and turned
to a maid. &ldquo;Where is his daughter Kathleen?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upstairs, sir, in her apartments,&rdquo; answered the maid,
wiping her red eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that she remains there,&rdquo; said the doctor gruffly. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
turning again to the physicians, &ldquo;I have but one suggestion.
Send for&ndash;&ndash;for&ndash;&ndash;that little girl, Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ill-advised, Doctor,&rdquo; interrupted one of the men. &ldquo;It
would only further excite him. It might hasten the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not agree with you,&rdquo; returned Doctor Morton. &ldquo;As it
is, he is doomed. With her here&ndash;&ndash;there may be a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_244' name='book4_page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted
stubbornly. Finally Doctor Haley gave his ultimatum. &ldquo;If
she is sent for, I shall retire from the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; announced Doctor Morton evenly, &ldquo;then I will
take it myself.&rdquo; He rose and went out into the vestibule where
there was a telephone. Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he
gave a peremptory order that Carmen come at once in the
automobile which he was sending for her.</p>
<p>The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl. Her
face was deathly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother dearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&ndash;&ndash;they want&ndash;&ndash;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;is it&ndash;&ndash;is he&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say he is&ndash;&ndash;dying,&rdquo; the woman whispered.</p>
<p>Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned. &ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t
know&ndash;&ndash;that there was&ndash;&ndash;anything wrong. Mother, you
didn&rsquo;t tell me! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl. Father Waite
rose from the table where he had been writing, and came to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said to Carmen. &ldquo;The Lord is with thee! Go in
this thy might!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames
mansion swung wide to admit the daughter of the house.</p>
<p>Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly
into the sick-room. The other physicians had departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carmen,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;Mr. Ames is past earthly
help. He can not live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky.
&ldquo;You mean, he <i>shall</i> not live!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;For you doctors
have sentenced him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The startled man bowed before the rebuke. Then a sense
of her magnificent environment, of her strange position, and
of the vivid events of the past few hours swept over her, and
she became embarrassed. The nurses and attendants, too, who
stood about and stared so hard at her, added to her confusion.</p>
<p>But the doctor took her hand. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
leaving now, but you will remain. If I am needed, one of the
maids will summon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmen stood for a moment without speaking. Then she
walked slowly to the bed and looked down at the man. Doctor
Morton motioned to the attendants to withdraw. Then he himself
stepped softly out and closed the door. When the girl
turned around, she was alone&ndash;&ndash;with death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 19</h2>
</div>
<p>A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of
the human mind, will not comprehend for many a year to
come what took place in that dim, tapestried chamber of
the rich man in those next hours. When twilight began to steal
through the marble halls of the great, shrouded mansion, the
nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly opened the door
of the sick-room and peeped in. Through the darkness she saw
the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man&rsquo;s right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.
And the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and
stole away.</p>
<p>The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would
leave but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien
over the telephone that all was well. Doctor Morton came,
and went, and came again. Carmen smiled, and held his hand
for a moment each time, but said little. Ames had slept. And,
more, his cheeks were stained where the scalding tears had
coursed down them. But the doctor would ask no questions.
He was satisfied. The nurses entered only when summoned.
And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt
with the man who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction
of others, had destroyed himself.</p>
<p>Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that
his patient would live&ndash;&ndash;but he would say no more. And the
world heard, too, that Kathleen Ames had left her father&rsquo;s roof&ndash;&ndash;left
in humiliation and chagrin when she learned that Carmen
had come there to live&ndash;&ndash;and had gone to England for a prolonged
visit with the Dowager Duchess of Altern and her now
thoroughly dismayed son. But Sidney came; and with him
the black-veiled Beaubien. And they both knelt beside the bed
of suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went
out and lay for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen
stood near. Then Willett was sent for; and he came often
after that, and took his master&rsquo;s scarce audible instructions,
and went away again to touch the wires and keys that ended
the war of hatred at Avon; that brought Father Danny in the
master&rsquo;s private car to the great metropolitan hospital; that
sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers on the
Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over
musty books and forgotten records for months to come.</p>
<p>What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_246' name='book4_page_246'></a>246</span>
who hovered over him like a ray of light, no one may know.
That he had trod the glowing embers of hell, his cavernous,
deep-lined face and whitening hair well testified. It was said
afterward that on that third day he had opened his eyes and
looked straight into those of the girl. It was said that she
then whispered but one word, &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; And that, when the
sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her
head down upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.
But what he had said, if aught, about the abandoned mother
who, on the banks of the distant river, years gone, had yielded
her life to him and his child, no one knew. Of but one thing
was there any certainty: the name of Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n
had not crossed their lips during those dark days.</p>
<p>And so two weeks passed. Then strong men lifted the
giant from his bed and placed him in a wheel chair; and
Carmen drew the chair out into the conservatory, among the
ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his hand still clasped
in both of hers. That he had found life, no one who marked
his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny. His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.</p>
<p>But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes
of a new life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy
of self-loathing; and, but for the girl who clung so desperately
to him, he would have quickly ended his useless existence.
What had he done! God! What mad work had he done! He
was a murderer of helpless babes! He was the blackest of
criminals! The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds,
stood always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he
gazed with horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.</p>
<p>And the torture was rendered more poignant by the
demands of his erstwhile associates and henchmen. They had
taken fright at the first orders which had issued from the
sick-bed, but now they swooped down upon the harassed man
to learn what might be expected from him in the future. What
were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks
ago? Was he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the
seat which the Ames money had purchased? Was the Ketchim
prosecution to continue? The Amalgamated Spinners&rsquo; Association
must know at once his further plans. The Budget needed
money and advice. His great railroad projects, his mining
ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes&ndash;&ndash;whither should they tend now? Ward bosses, dive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_247' name='book4_page_247'></a>247</span>
keepers, bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers
clamored for admission at his doors when they learned that
he would live, but that a marvelous, incomprehensible change
had swept over him.</p>
<p>The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen. And she called
Hitt and Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien. The latter&rsquo;s
wide business experience and worldly knowledge now stood
them all in good stead, and she threw herself like a bulwark
between the stricken man and the hounds that roared at his
gates. There were those among them who, like Ames, had
bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform, and
yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance,
of politics, of religion. There were those who sensed the slow
awakening of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately,
and who now sat frightened and angered at the
thought of losing their great leader. Their attitude toward
life, like his, had been wrong from the beginning; they, like
him, were striking examples of the dire effects of a false viewpoint
in the impoverishing of human life. But, with him, they
had built up a tremendous material fabric. And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed. For
they must know that his was a type that was fast passing,
and after it must come the complete breakdown of the old
financial order. His world-embracing gambling&ndash;&ndash;which
touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the very
necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions&ndash;&ndash;had ceased
forever. What did it portend to them?</p>
<p>And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose
congregation sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth,
whose pockets bulged with disease-laden profits from the sales
of women&rsquo;s bodies and souls. Reverend Borwell came to offer
the sufferer the dubious consolations of religion&ndash;&ndash;and inquire
if his beautiful change of heart would affect the benefaction
which he had designed for the new church.</p>
<p>Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the
Apostle&rsquo;s awful question: What fruit had ye then in those
things whereof ye are now ashamed? <i>For the end of those
things is death!</i></p>
<p>And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the
sick man, but the girl. And, alone with her in the great library
that day, he bent low over her hand and begged that she
would forgive and forget. It was he who told Mrs. Ames that
flagrantly false tale of the girl&rsquo;s parentage. He had received
it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena. It was he who, surmising
the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the supposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_248' name='book4_page_248'></a>248</span>
Infanta had been his wife. And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital
out of it. But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen&rsquo;s
connection with the mystery. And now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated
man. And when he kissed her hand and departed, she bade
him know, always, that she loved him as a brother. And he
knew it, knew that her love was of the spirit&ndash;&ndash;it left all for
the Christ.</p>
<p>A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion
a cable message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the
master had sent to the lawyer, Estrella. Ames shook with
suppressed excitement when he read it. Then he bade Carmen
send at once for Hitt, Willett, and Captain McCall, and leave
them with him for a private conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must not know! She must not know!&rdquo; Ames repeated,
as the three men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour
later, drinking in every word he spoke. &ldquo;If the mission is
successful, well and good. If it fails, then our silence now
will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing to her regarding
him. Peace is being concluded there. Wenceslas has won&ndash;&ndash;but
with&ndash;&ndash;but of that later. When can you get under way,
McCall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night, sir. The bunkers are full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. I will go aboard at ten. You will weigh
anchor immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Hitt. &ldquo;You will go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly
startled them from their chairs. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you, Mr.
Hitt, will accompany us. Now, Willett, have the door of my
limousine widened to accommodate this wheel chair. I want
a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to keep the way clear.
No one not in our confidence must see us depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt gasped. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;Carmen&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goes with us,&rdquo; returned Ames. &ldquo;I can not spare her for
a moment. Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house
during our absence. We will be back here, weather favorable,
in three weeks&ndash;&ndash;or not at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, she will know&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get
away from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation&ndash;&ndash;anything!
Go, now, and make ready!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes
glistened like live coals, and his sunken cheeks took on a
feverish glow.</p>
<p>That night the <i>Cossack</i>, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly
out of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_249' name='book4_page_249'></a>249</span>
South. And when she had entered the high sea, Captain McCall
from his bridge aloft sent a message down to the waiting
engineer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full speed ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 20</h2>
</div>
<p>Cartagena&rsquo;s slumber of centuries had been broken by
nearly four years of civil warfare. But on the day that the
lookout in the abandoned convent of Santa Candelaria, on
the summit of La Popa, flashed the message down into the old
city that a steam yacht had appeared on the northern horizon,
she was preparing to sink back again into quiet dreams. For
peace was being concluded among the warring political factions.
The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause of
Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogot&aacute;. Cartagena was <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>; the last of the
political agitators would be executed on the morrow. And so
the lookout&rsquo;s message was received with indifference, even
though he embellished it with the comment that the boat must
be privately owned, as no ships of the regular lines were due
to arrive that day.</p>
<p>Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba
and into the Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San
Fernando and San Jos&egrave;, and came to anchor out in the beautiful
harbor, a half mile from the ancient gate of the clock.
A few curious idlers along the shore watched it and commented
on its perfect lines. And the numerous officials of the
port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly awaited the
arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and headed
for the pier.</p>
<p>The tall American who stepped from the little boat and
came at once to them to show his papers, easily satisfied their
curiosity, for many tourists of the millionaire class dropped
anchor in Cartagena&rsquo;s wonderful harbor, and came ashore to
wander among the decaying mementos of her glorious past.
And this boat was not a stranger to these waters. On the
yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it, there was no
sign of life. Even the diminishing volume of smoke that rose
from its funnels evidenced the owner&rsquo;s intention of spending
some time in that romantic spot.</p>
<p>From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the
massive wall, quickly crossed the <i>Plaza de Coches</i>, and lost
himself in the gay throngs that were entering upon the day&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_250' name='book4_page_250'></a>250</span>
festivities. Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little
stores, and lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip. Then
he slowly made his way up past the Cathedral and into the
<i>Plaza de Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</i>.</p>
<p>For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian
statue of the famous <i>Libertador</i>, he watched the passing
crowds. From time to time his glance strayed over toward
the Cathedral. Once he rose, and started in that direction;
then came back and resumed his seat. It was evident that he
was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to pursue.</p>
<p>Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little
cigar store which had caught his eye. He bent over the soiled
glass case and selected several cigars from the shabby stock.
Putting one of them into his mouth, he lighted it, and then
casually nodded to a powerfully built man standing near.</p>
<p>The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment
in Spanish. Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.
The man flushed with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and
offered an apology. &ldquo;I forget, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that so many
Americans speak our language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.
Then his eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I examine it?&rdquo; he asked, bending toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cierto</i>, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>,&rdquo; returned the man cordially. &ldquo;It came from
an Indian grave up in Guamoc&oacute;. I am a <i>guaquero</i>&ndash;&ndash;grave digger&ndash;&ndash;by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt glanced up at the man. Somehow he seemed to be
familiar with that name. Somewhere he seemed to have heard
it. But on whose lips? Carmen&rsquo;s? &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he said, in
his excellent Spanish, &ldquo;that we cross the <i>Plaza</i> to yonder wine
shop. You may be able to tell me some of the history of this
interesting old town. And&ndash;&ndash;it would be a great favor, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation. A
few moments later they sat at a little table, with a bottle
between them, commenting on the animated scene in the street
without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace will be concluded to-day, they say,&rdquo; reflected Hitt,
by way of introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the man grimly, &ldquo;there is but little more
blood to let. That flows to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Political agitators?&rdquo; Hitt suggested.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face darkened. &ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The
other is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively. But the American
manifested only a casual interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their names?&rdquo; he asked nonchalantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_251' name='book4_page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They were posted this morning,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Amado
Jesus Fanor and Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt started, but held himself. &ldquo;Who&ndash;&ndash;who are they?&rdquo;
he asked in a controlled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A liberal general and an ex-priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ex-priest?&rdquo; exclaimed Hitt.</p>
<p>The man looked at him wonderingly. &ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing. It is the custom to&ndash;&ndash;to shoot ex-priests
down here, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i> No! But this man&ndash;&ndash;se&ntilde;or, why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;it struck me as curious&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; returned Hitt,
at a loss for a suitable answer. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen to know
these men, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, you seek to involve me. Who are you, that you
ask such questions of a stranger?&rdquo; The man reflected the
suspicious caution of these troublous times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>amigo</i>, it is of no concern to me,&rdquo; replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar. &ldquo;I once knew a fellow by
that name. Met him here years ago. Learned that he afterward
went to Simit&iacute;. But I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; cried the man, starting up. &ldquo;Are you the <i>Americano</i>,
the man who explored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Hitt, bending closer to him. &ldquo;And we are well
met, for you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n
in Simit&iacute;, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man cast a timid glance around the room. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;we must not say these things here! I leave
you now&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; Hitt laid a hand upon his. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he
demanded in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In San Fernando, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year, I think. He was first three years in the prison in
Cartagena. But the Bish&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be shot to-morrow, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt thought with desperate rapidity. Then he looked up.
&ldquo;Why do you say he is an ex-priest?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has just been excommunicated,&rdquo; replied the man.
&ldquo;Cursed, they say, by bell, book, and candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! That he might be shot? Ah, I see it all!
Ames&rsquo;s message! Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to
execute a priest in good standing. And so he had him excommunicated,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_252' name='book4_page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>Don Jorge shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;<i>Quien sabe?</i>&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Hitt sat for a while in a deep study. Time was precious.
And yet it was flying like the winds. Then he roused up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew a little girl&ndash;&ndash;in Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;in whom this Rinc&oacute;n
was interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, se&ntilde;or. But&ndash;&ndash;why do you ask? She went to the
great States from which you come. And I think little was
heard from her after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? Yes, true. She lived with&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Rosendo Ariza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead&ndash;&ndash;he and his good wife, Do&ntilde;a Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt&rsquo;s head sank. How could he break this to Carmen?
Then he sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will stroll
down by the walls. I would like a look at San Fernando.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Se&ntilde;or, you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt threw him a look of caution, and shook his head. Then,
motioning him to follow, he led him out and down through the
winding, tortuous thoroughfares. On the summit of the walls
were sentinels, posted at frequent intervals; and no civilian
might walk upon the great enclosure until peace had been
formally declared.</p>
<p>Hailing a passing carriage, Hitt urged the wondering Don
Jorge into it, and bade the driver convey them to the old ruin
of San Felipe, and leave them. There they climbed the broken
incline into the battered fortress, and seated themselves in the
shadow of a crumbling parapet. They were alone on the
enormous, grass-grown pile. From their position they commanded
a wonderful view across the town and harbor, and
far out over the green waters of the Caribbean. The <i>Cossack</i>
lay asleep in the quiet harbor. Don Jorge saw it, and wondered
whence it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, <i>amigo</i>,&rdquo; began Hitt, pointing to the yacht. &ldquo;In that
boat is a girl, whose dearest earthly treasure is the condemned
prisoner out there in San Fernando. That girl is the little
Carmen, foster-daughter of old Rosendo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hombre!</i>&rdquo; cried Don Jorge, staring at Hitt as if he suspected
his sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, friend, for I myself came with her in that boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Hitt, glancing again about the ruined
fortress and lowering his voice, &ldquo;we have come for Jos&egrave; de
Rinc&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen!</i> Are you <i>loco</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt smiled. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he went on eagerly, &ldquo;how are we
to get him?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_253' name='book4_page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But, <i>amigo</i>! San Fernando is closely guarded! And he&ndash;&ndash;<i>por
supuesto</i>, he will be in the dungeons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; returned Hitt dryly, &ldquo;if your excellent friend
Wenceslas has had anything to do with it. But dungeons have
windows, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba</i>, yes; and San Fernando&rsquo;s are just above the
water&rsquo;s edge. And when the waves are high the sea pours
into them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;could we learn which window is his, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, I know,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! And&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned from one of the soldiers, Fernando, who once
lived in Simit&iacute;. I had thought, se&ntilde;or, that&ndash;&ndash;that perhaps I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That perhaps you might make the attempt yourself, eh?&rdquo;
put in Hitt eagerly.</p>
<p>Don Jorge nodded. Hitt sprang to his feet and looked out
toward the silent fortress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Jorge, it is dark out over the harbor at night, eh?
No searchlights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt began to pace back and forth. Suddenly he stopped,
and stood looking down through a hole in the broken pavement.
Then he knelt and peered long and eagerly into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, friend,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;How does one get into that
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jorge came and looked into the aperture. &ldquo;It is one
of the rooms of the fortress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;<i>caramba</i>! I
know not how it may be reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The passageways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caved&ndash;&ndash;all of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you are a mighty husky fellow; and I am not weak.
Suppose we try lifting one of these flags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na</i>, <i>se&ntilde;or</i>, as well try the tunnels! But, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitt did not answer. But, bidding Don Jorge follow, he
sought the fallen entrance to the old fortress, and plunged
into the dark passage that led off from it into the thick gloom.
Groping his way down a long, damp corridor, he came to a
point where three narrower, brick-lined tunnels branched off,
one of them dipping into the earth at a sharp angle. He struck
a match, and then started down this, followed by the wondering
Don Jorge.</p>
<p>A thousand bats, hideous denizens of these black tunnels,
flouted their faces and disputed their progress. Don Jorge
slapped wildly at them, and cursed low. Hitt took up a long
club and struck savagely about him. On they stumbled, until
the match flickered out, and they were left in Stygian blackness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_254' name='book4_page_254'></a>254</span>
with the imps of darkness whirring madly about them.
Hitt struck another match, and plunged ahead.</p>
<p>At length they found the way blocked by a mass of rubbish
which had fallen from the roof. Hitt studied it for a moment,
then climbed upon it and, by the aid of the feeble light from
his matches, peered into the foul blackness beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, preparing to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Na, amigo!</i> Not I!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Jorge. His Latin
soul had revolted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then wait for me here,&rdquo; said Hitt, pushing himself through
the narrow aperture at the top of the rubbish, and fighting
the horde of terrified bats.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he returned, covered with slime, and
scratched and bleeding. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s
get out of this miserable hole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out in the sunlight once more, Hitt sought to remove the
stains from his clothes, meanwhile bidding Don Jorge attend
well to his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swim, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you come to the beach to-night to bathe, down
across from the yacht. And, listen well: you would do much
for the little Carmen, no? And for your friend Jos&egrave;? Very
good. You will swim out to the yacht at seven to-night, with
your clothes in a bundle on your head, eh? And, Don Jorge&ndash;&ndash;but
we will discuss that later. Now you go back to the city
alone. I have much to do. And, note this, you have not seen
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, to the group of politicians, soldiers, and clergy
assembled in the long audience room of the departmental offices
to debate the terms of the peace protocol, news of the arrival
of the <i>Cossack</i> was brought by a slow-moving messenger from
the dock. At the abrupt announcement the acting-Bishop was
seen to start from his chair. Was the master himself on
board? <i>Quien sabe?</i> And, if so&ndash;&ndash;but, impossible! He would
have advised his faithful co-laborer of his coming. And yet,
what were those strange rumors which had trickled over the
wires, and which, in his absorption in the local issues, and in
the excitement attendant upon the restoration of peace and
the settlement of the multifold claims of innumerable greedy
politicians, he had all but forgotten? A thousand suggestions
flashed through his mind, any one of which might account for
the presence of the <i>Cossack</i> in Cartagena&rsquo;s harbor that day.
But extreme caution must be observed until he might ascertain
its errand. He therefore despatched a message to the yacht,
expressing his great surprise and pleasure, and bidding its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_255' name='book4_page_255'></a>255</span>
master meet him at a convenient hour in his study in the Cathedral.
This done, he bent anew to the work before him, yet
with his thought harried by doubt, suspicion, and torturing
curiosity.</p>
<p>Wenceslas soon received a reply to his message. The
master was aboard, but unable to go ashore. The acting-Bishop
would therefore come to him at once.</p>
<p>Wenceslas hesitated, and his brow furrowed. He knew he
was called upon to render his reckoning to the great financier
who had furnished the sinews of war. But he must have time
to consider thoroughly his own advantage, for well he understood
that he was summoned to match his own keen wits with
those of a master mind.</p>
<p>And then there flashed through his thought the reports
which had circled the world but three short weeks before. The
man of wealth had found his daughter; and she was the girl
for whom the two Americans had outwitted him four years
ago! And the girl&ndash;&ndash;Simit&iacute;&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;ah, Rinc&oacute;n! Good! He
laughed outright. He would meet the financier&ndash;&ndash;but not until
the morrow, at noon, for, he would allege, the unanticipated
arrival of Ames had found this day completely occupied. So
he again despatched his wondering messenger to the <i>Cossack</i>.
And that messenger was rowed out to the quiet yacht in the
same boat with the tall American, whose clothes were torn and
caked with mud, and in whose eyes there glowed a fierce
determination.</p>
<p>That night the sky was overcast. The harbingers of the
wet season had already arrived. At two in the morning the
rain came, descending in a torrent. In the midst of it a light
skiff, rocking dangerously on the swelling sea, rounded a corner
of San Fernando and crept like a shadow along the dull gray
wall. The sentry above had taken shelter from the driving rain.
The ancient fort lay heavily shrouded in gloom.</p>
<p>At one of the narrow, grated windows which were set just
above the water&rsquo;s surface the skiff hung, and a long form arose
from its depths and grasped the iron bars. A moment later
the gleam of an electric lantern flashed into the blackness within.
It fell upon a rough bench, standing in foul, slime-covered
water. Upon the bench sat the huddled form of a man.</p>
<p>Then another dark shape rose in the skiff. Another pair
of hands laid hold on the iron bars. And behind those great,
calloused hands stretched thick arms, with the strength of an
ox. An iron lever was inserted between the bars. The heavy
breathing and the low sounds of the straining were drowned
by the tropic storm. The prisoner leaped from the bench and
stood ankle-deep in the water, straining his eyes upward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_256' name='book4_page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>The light flashed again into his face. His heart pounded
wildly. His throbbing ears caught the splash of a knotted rope
falling into the water at his feet. Above the noise of the rain
he thought he heard a groaning, creaking sound. Those rusted,
storm-eaten bars in the blackness above must be slowly
yielding to an awful pressure. He turned and dragged the
slime-covered bench to the window, and stood upon it. Then
he grasped the rope with a strength born anew of hope and
excitement, and pulled himself upward. The hands from without
seized him; and slowly, painfully, his emaciated body was
crushed through the narrow space between the bent bars.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Cartagena awoke to experience another thrill. And then
the ripple of excitement gave place to anger. The rabble had
lost one of its victims, and that one the chief. Moreover, the
presence of that graceful yacht, sleeping so quietly out there in
the sunlit harbor, could not but be associated with that most
daring deed of the preceding night, which had given liberty to
the excommunicated priest and political malefactor, Jos&egrave; de
Rinc&oacute;n. Crowds of chattering, gesticulating citizens gathered
along the harbor shores, and loudly voiced their disappointment
and threats. But the boat lay like a thing asleep. Not even a
wisp of smoke rose from its yellow funnels.</p>
<p>Then came the Alcalde, and the Departmental Governor,
grave and sedate, with their aids and secretaries, their books
and documents, their mandates and red-sealed processes, and
were rowed out to confront the master whom they believed to
have dared to thwart the hand of justice and remain to taunt
them with his egregious presence. This should be made an
international episode, whose ramifications would wind down
through years to come, and embrace long, stupid congressional
debates, apologies demanded, huge sums to salve a wounded
nation, and the making and breaking of politicians too numerous
to mention!</p>
<p>But the giant who received them, bound to his chair, in the
splendid library of the palatial yacht, and with no attendant,
save a single valet, flared out in a towering rage at the gross
insult offered him and his great country in these black charges.
He had come on a peaceful errand; partly, too, for reasons of
health. And he was at that moment awaiting a visit from His
Grace. What manner of reception was this, that Cartagena extended
to an influential representative of the powerful States
of the North!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; the discomfited Indignation Committee gasped,
&ldquo;what of the tall American who was seen to land the day
before?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_257' name='book4_page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>The master laughed in their faces. He? Why, but a poor,
obsessed archaeologist, now prowling around the ruins of San
Felipe, doubtless mumbling childishly as he prods the dust and
mold of centuries! Go, visit him, if they would be convinced!</p>
<p>And when these had gone, chagrined and mortified&ndash;&ndash;though
filled with wonder, for they had roamed the <i>Cossack</i>, and
peered into its every nook and cranny, and stopped to look a
second time at the fair-haired young boy who looked like a
girl, and hovered close to the master&ndash;&ndash;came His Grace, Wenceslas.
He came alone, and with a sneer curling his imperious
lips. And his calm, arrogant eyes held a meaning that boded
no good to the man who sat in his wheel chair, alone, and could
not rise to welcome him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty trick, my powerful friend,&rdquo; said the angered
churchman in his perfect English. &ldquo;And one that will cause
your Government at Washington some&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; interrupted Ames in a steady voice. &ldquo;I sent for
you yesterday, intending to ask you to release the man. I had
terms then which would have advantaged you greatly. You
were afraid to see me until you had evolved your plans of
opposition. Only a fixed and devilish hatred, nourished by you
against a harmless priest who possessed your secrets, doomed
him to die to-day. But we will pass that for the present. I
have here my demands for the aid I have furnished you. You
may look them over.&rdquo; He held out some typewritten sheets to
Wenceslas.</p>
<p>The churchman glanced hastily over them; then handed
them back with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With certain modifications,&rdquo; he said smoothly. &ldquo;The terms
on which peace is concluded will scarcely admit of&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; returned Ames quietly. &ldquo;And now, La Libertad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas laughed. &ldquo;<i>En manos muertas</i>, my friend,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;It was your own idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the emerald concession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! A government monopoly, you know,&rdquo; said His
Grace easily. &ldquo;You see, my friend, it is a costly matter to effect
the escape of state prisoners. As things stand now, your little
trick of last night quite protects me. For, first you instruct me,
long ago, to place the weak little Jos&egrave; in San Fernando; and I
obey. Then you suffer a change of heart, and slip down here to
release the man, who has become a state prisoner. That quite
removes you from any claims upon us for a share of the spoils
of war. I take it, you do not wish to risk exposure of your
part in this four years&rsquo; carnage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames drew a sigh. Then he pulled himself together. &ldquo;Wenceslas,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_258' name='book4_page_258'></a>258</span>
he said, &ldquo;I am not the man with whom you dealt in
these matters. He is dead. I have but one thing more to say,
and that is that I renounce all claims upon you and your Government,
excepting one. La Libertad mine was owned by the
Rinc&oacute;n family. It was rediscovered by old Rosendo, and the
title transferred to his foster-daughter. Its possession must
remain with her and her associates. There is no record, so
you have informed me, to the effect that the Church possesses
this mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my friend, there shall be such a record to-day,&rdquo;
laughed Wenceslas. &ldquo;And, in your present situation, you will
hardly care to contest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ames smiled. He now had the information which he had
been seeking. The title to the famous mine lay still with the
Simit&iacute; company. He pressed the call-button attached to his
chair. The door opened, and Don Jorge entered, leading the
erstwhile little newsboy, Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, by the hand.</p>
<p>Wenceslas gasped, and staggered back. He knew not the
man; but the boy was a familiar figure.</p>
<p>Don Jorge advanced straight to him. Their faces almost
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Grace, were you married to the woman by whom you
had this son?&rdquo; Don Jorge&rsquo;s steady words fell upon the churchman&rsquo;s
ears like a sentence of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask,&rdquo; continued the dark-faced man, &ldquo;because I learned
last night that the lad&rsquo;s mother was my daughter, the little
Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santa Virgen!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Grace, a sainted virgin, despoiled by a devil!
And the man who gave me this information&ndash;&ndash;would you like to
know? <i>Bien</i>, it was Padre Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, in whose arms she
died, you lecherous dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas paled, and his brow grew moist. He stared at
the boy, and then at the strong man whom he had so foully
wronged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have concluded your talk with Se&ntilde;or Ames,&rdquo; continued
Don Jorge, &ldquo;we will go ashore&ndash;&ndash;you and the lad and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenceslas&rsquo;s face brightened. Ashore! Yes, by all means!</p>
<p>The trio turned and quietly left the room. Gaining the
deck, Wenceslas found a skiff awaiting them, and two strong
sailors at the oars. Don Jorge urged him on, and together they
descended the ladder and entered the boat. A few moments
later they landed at the pier, and the skiff turned back to the
yacht.</p>
<p>As to just what followed, accounts vary. There were some
who remembered seeing His Grace pass through the narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_259' name='book4_page_259'></a>259</span>
streets with a dark-skinned, powerful man, whose hand
grasped that of the young newsboy. There were others who
said that they saw the boy leave them at the Cathedral, and
the two men turn and enter. Still others said they saw the
heavy-set man come out alone. But there was only one who
discovered the body of Wenceslas, crumpled up in a hideous
heap upon the floor of his study, with a poignard driven clean
through his heart. That man was the old sexton, who fled
screaming from the awful sight late that afternoon.</p>
<p>Again Cartagena shook with excitement, and seethed with
mystery. Had the escaped prisoner, Rinc&oacute;n, returned to commit
this awful deed? There were those who said he had. For
the dark-skinned man who had entered the Cathedral with His
Grace was seen again on the streets and in the wine shops that
afternoon, and had been marked by some mounting the broken
incline of San Felipe.</p>
<p>Again the Governor and Alcalde and their numerous suite
paid a visit to the master on board the <i>Cossack</i>. But they
learned only that His Grace had gone ashore long before he
met his fearful death. And so the Governor returned to the
city, and was driven to San Felipe. But his only reward was
the sight of the obsessed archaeologist, mud-stained and absorbed,
prying about the old ruins, and uttering little cries of
delight at new discoveries of crumbling passageways and caving
rooms. And so there was nothing for the disturbed town to do
but settle down and ponder the strange case.</p>
<p>A week later smoke was seen again pouring out of the <i>Cossack&rsquo;s</i>
funnels. That same day the Governor and Alcalde and
their suites were bidden to a farewell banquet on board the
luxurious yacht. Far into the night they sat over their rare
wines and rich food, drinking deep healths to the <i>entente
cordial</i> which existed between the little republic of the South
and the great one of the North. And while they drank and
sang and listened enraptured to the wonderful pipe-organ, a
little boat put out from the dark, tangled shrubbery along the
shore. And when it rubbed against the yacht, a muffled figure
mounted the ladder which hung in the shadows, and hastened
through the rear hatchway and down into the depths of the
boat. Then, long after midnight, the last farewell being said
by the dizzy officials, and the echoes of <i>Adios</i>, <i>adios</i>, <i>amigos</i>!
lingering among its tall spars, the <i>Cossack</i> slipped noiselessly
out of the Boca Chica, and set its course for New York.</p>
<p>A few hours later, while the boat sped swiftly through the
phosphorescent waves, the escaped prisoner, Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n,
who had lain for a week hidden in the bowels of old fort San
Felipe, stood alone in the wonderful smoking room of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_260' name='book4_page_260'></a>260</span>
<i>Cossack</i>, and looked up at the sweet face pictured in the stained-glass
window above. And then he turned quickly, for the door
opened and a girl entered. A rush, a cry of joy, and his arms
closed about the fair vision that had sat by his side constantly
during the four long years of his imprisonment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Jos&egrave;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have solved my problem! I have proved God! I have
found the Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would, for he was with you always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;oh, you beautiful, beautiful girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a little while she gently released herself and went
to the door through which she had entered. She paused for
a moment to smile back at the enraptured man, then turned
and flung the door wide.</p>
<p>A woman entered, leading a young boy. The man uttered
a loud exclamation and started toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short and stared down at the boy. Then he
looked wonderingly at Carmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, stooping and lifting the boy up before Jos&egrave;,
&ldquo;it is Anita&rsquo;s babe&ndash;&ndash;<i>and he sees</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man clasped the child in his arms and buried his face
in its hair.</p>
<p>Verily, upon them that sat in darkness had the Light shined.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER 21</h2>
</div>
<p>Another summer had come and gone. Through the trees
in Central Park the afternoon sunlight, sifted and softened
by the tinted autumn leaves, spread over the brown turf
like a gossamer web. And it fell like a gentle benediction upon
the massive figure of a man, walking unsteadily beneath the
trees, holding the hand of a young girl whose beauty made
every passer turn and look again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, father,&rdquo; laughed the girl, &ldquo;once more! There! Why,
you step off like a major!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were familiar figures, out there in the park, for almost
daily during the past few weeks they might have been seen, as
the girl laughingly said, &ldquo;practicing their steps.&rdquo; And daily the
man&rsquo;s control became firmer; daily that limp left arm and leg
seemed increasingly to manifest life.</p>
<p>On a bench near by sat a dark-featured woman. About her
played her boy, filling the air with his merry shouts and his
imperfect English.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_261' name='book4_page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There, father, comes Jos&egrave; after us,&rdquo; announced the girl,
looking off with love-lit eyes at an approaching automobile.
&ldquo;And Lewis is with him. Now, mind, you are going to get into
the car without any help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed, and declared vehemently that if he could
not get in alone he would walk home. A few minutes later they
had gone.</p>
<p>The profound depth of those changes which had come into
the rich man&rsquo;s life, he himself might not fathom. But those
who toiled daily with him over his great ledgers and files knew
that the transformation went far. There were flashes at times
of his former vigor and spirit of domination, but there were also
periods of grief that were heart-rending to behold, as when,
poring over his records for the name of one whom in years
past he had ruthlessly wrecked, he would find that the victim
had gone in poverty beyond his power to reimburse him. And
again, when his thought dwelt on Avon, and the carnal madness
which had filled those new graves there, he would sink
moaning into his chair and bury his drawn face in his hands
and sob.</p>
<p>And yet he strove madly, feverishly, to restore again to
those from whom he had taken. The Simit&iacute; company was revived,
through his labors, and the great La Libertad restored
to its reanimated stockholders. Work of development had
begun on the property, and Harris was again in Colombia in
charge of operations. The Express was booming, and the rich
man had consecrated himself to the carrying out of its clean
policies. The mills at Avon were running day and night; and
in a new location, far from the old-time &ldquo;lungers&rsquo; alley,&rdquo; long
rows of little cottages were going up for their employes. The
lawyer Collins had been removed, and Lewis Waite was to take
his place within a week. Father Danny, now recovered, rejoiced
in resources such as he had never dared hope to command.</p>
<p>And so the rich man toiled&ndash;&ndash;ah, God! if he had only known
before that in the happiness of others lay his own. If only he
could have known that but a moiety of his vast, unused income
would have let floods of sunshine into the lives of those
dwarfed, stunted children who toiled for him, and never played!
Oh, if when he closed his mills in the dull months he had but
sent them and their tired mothers to the country fields, how
they would have risen up and called him blessed! If he could
have but known that he was his brother&rsquo;s keeper, and in a
sense that the world as yet knows not! For he is indeed wise
who loves his fellow-men; and he is a fool who hates them!</p>
<p>The great Fifth Avenue mansion was dark, except where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_262' name='book4_page_262'></a>262</span>
hung a cluster of glowing bulbs over the rich mahogany table
in the library. There about that table sat the little group of
searchers after God, with their number augmented now in
ways of which they could not have dreamed. And Hitt, great-souled
friend of the world, was speaking again as had been his
wont in the days now gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The solution of the problems of mankind? Ah, yes, there
is a cure-all; there is a final answer to every ethical question,
every social, industrial, economic problem, the problems of
liquor, poverty, disease, war. And the remedy is so universal
that it dissolves even the tangles of tariff and theology. What
is it? Ah, my friends, the girl who came among us to &lsquo;show
the world what love will do&rsquo; has taught us by her own rich
life&ndash;&ndash;it is love. But not the sex-mesmerism, the covetousness,
the self-love, which mask behind that heavenly name. For God
is Love. And to know Him is to receive that marvelous Christ-principle
which unlocks for mankind the door of harmony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the world&rsquo;s troubles are not the fault of one man, nor
of many, but of all who seek happiness in things material, and
forget that the real man is the likeness of spirit, and that joy
is spiritual. The trusts, and the men of wealth, are not all
malefactors; the churches are not wholly filled with evil men.
But all, yes all, have &lsquo;missed the mark&rsquo; through the belief that
matter and evil are real, and must grope amid sickness, poverty,
crime, and death, until they are willing to turn from such false
beliefs, and from self, and seek their own in the reflection of
Him, who is Love, to their fellow-men. It is only as men join
to search for and apply the Christ-principle that they truly
unite to solve the world&rsquo;s sore problems and reveal the waiting
kingdom of harmony, which is always just at hand. And it
can be done. It must be, sometime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that day all shall know that cause and effect are mental.
The man who hears the tempter, the carnal mind&rsquo;s suggestion
to enrich himself materially at the cost of his brother, will
know that it is but the voice of mesmerism, that &lsquo;man-killer
from the beginning&rsquo;, which bids him sever himself from his
God, who alone is infinite abundance. The society woman who
flits like a gorgeous butterfly about the courts of fashion, her
precious days wasted in motoring, her nights at cards, and
whose vitality goes into dress, and into the watery schemes for
&lsquo;who shall be greatest&rsquo; in the dismal realm of the human mind,
must learn, willingly or through suffering, that her activities
are but mesmeric shams that counterfeit the divine activity
which manifests in joy and fullness for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christianity? What is it but the Christ-knowledge, the
knowledge of good, and its correlated knowledge, that evil is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_263' name='book4_page_263'></a>263</span>
only the mesmeric lie which has engulfed the world? But, oh,
the depths of that divine knowledge! The knowledge which
heals the sick, gives sight to the blind, and opens the prisons
to them that are captive! We who are gathered here to-night,
feeling in our midst that great, unseen Presence which makes
for righteousness, know now that &lsquo;in my flesh shall I see God,&rsquo;
for we have indeed already seen and known Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With them sat the man who, swept by the storms of error
and the carnal winds of destruction, had solved his problem,
even as the girl by his side told him he should, and had been
found, when his foul prison opened, sitting &ldquo;clothed and in his
right mind&rdquo; at the feet of the Christ. Jesus &ldquo;saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit&ndash;&ndash;God&ndash;&ndash;like a dove descending upon him&ndash;&ndash;immediately
the Spirit&ndash;&ndash;carnal belief, error, the lie&ndash;&ndash;driveth
him into the wilderness.&rdquo; And there he was made to prove God.
So Jos&egrave; de Rinc&oacute;n, when the light had come, years gone, in
desolate Simit&iacute;, had been bidden to know the one God, and none
else. But he wavered when the floods of evil rolled over him;
he had looked longingly back; he had clung too tightly to the
human concept that walked with him like a shining light in
those dark days. And so she had been taken from him, and he
had been hurled into the wilderness&ndash;&ndash;alone with Him whom he
must learn to know if he would see Life.</p>
<p>Then self-consciousness went out, in those four years of his
captivity, and he passed from thence into consciousness of God.</p>
<p>Then his great world-knowledge he saw to have been wholly
untrue. His store of truth he saw to have been but relative at
best. His knowledge had rested, he then knew, upon viewpoints
which had been utterly false. And so, like Paul, he died
that he might live. He crucified Self, that he might resurrect
the image of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; resumed Hitt, &ldquo;still worships false gods,
though it reaches out for Truth. And yet, what are we all
seeking? Only a state of consciousness, a consciousness of
good, of joy and harmony. And we are seeking to rid ourselves
of the consciousness of evil, with its sin, its disease and death.
But, knowing now that consciousness is mental activity, the
activity of thought, can we not see that harmony and immortality
are within our grasp? for they are functions of right
thought. Salvation is not from evil realities, but from the false
sense of evil, even as Jesus taught and proved. The only salvation
possible to mankind is in learning to think as Jesus did&ndash;&ndash;not
yielding our mentalities daily to a hodge-podge of mixed
thoughts of good and evil, and then running to doctors and
preachers when such yielding brings its inevitable result in
sickness and death. Jesus insisted that the kingdom of heaven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_264' name='book4_page_264'></a>264</span>
was within men, a tremendous potentiality within each one of
us. How may it be reached? By removing hampering false
belief, by removing the limitations of superstition and human
opinion which hold its portals closed. True progress is the
release of mankind from materialism, with its enslaving
drudgery, its woes, and its inevitable death. Mankind&rsquo;s chief
difficulty is ignorance of what God is. Jesus proved Him to be
mind, spirit. He proved Him to be the creator of the spiritual
universe, but not the originator of the lie of materiality. He
showed matter to be but the manifestation of the false belief
that creation is material. He showed it to be but a sense-impression,
without life, without stability, without existence,
except the pseudo-existence which it has in the false thought
of which the human or carnal consciousness is formed. But
the lack of understanding of the real nature of matter, and the
persistent belief in the stability of its so-called laws, has resulted
in centuries of attempts to discredit the Bible records
of his spiritual demonstrations of God&rsquo;s omnipotence and immanence,
and so has prevented the human mind from accepting
the proofs which it so eagerly sought. And now, after nineteen
centuries of so-called Christian teaching, the human mind
remains still deeply embedded in matter, and subject to the
consentaneous human beliefs which it calls material laws.
Jesus showed that it was the communal mortal mind, with its
false beliefs in matter, sin, disease, and death, that constituted
&lsquo;the flesh&rsquo;; he showed that mortals are begotten of such false
beliefs; he showed that the material universe is but manifested
human belief. And we know from our own reasoning that we
see not things, but our <i>thoughts</i> of things; that we deal not
with matter, but with material mental concepts only. We
know that the preachers have woefully missed the mark, and
that the medicines of the doctors have destroyed more lives
than wars and famine, and yet will we not learn of the Master?
To reach God through material thinking is utterly impossible,
for He is spirit, and He can be cognized only by a spiritual
consciousness. Yet such a consciousness is ours, if we will
but have it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, friends, God said: Let US make man in OUR image and
likeness&ndash;&ndash;let Life, Love, Spirit make its spiritual reflection.
But where is that man to-day? Buried deep beneath the dogma
and the crystallized human beliefs of mortals&ndash;&ndash;buried beneath
&lsquo;the lie&rsquo; which mankind accept about truth. Nothing but <i>scientific</i>
religion will meet humanity&rsquo;s dire needs and reveal that
man. And scientific religion admits of actual, practical proof.
Christianity is as scientific as mathematics, and quite as capable
of demonstration. Its proofs lie in doing the works of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_265' name='book4_page_265'></a>265</span>
Master. He is a Christian who does these works; he who does
not is none. Christianity is not a failure, but organized ecclesiasticism,
which always collapses before a world crisis, has
failed utterly. The hideous chicane of imperial government
and imperial religion against mankind has resulted in a
Christian veneer, which cracks at the first test and reveals the
unchanged human brute beneath. The nations which writhe
in deadly embrace to-day have never sought to prove God.
They but emphasize the awful fact that the human mind has
no grasp upon the Principle which is God, and at a time of
crisis reverts almost instantly to the primitive, despite so-called
culture and civilization. Yes, religion as a perpetuation of
ancient human conceptions, of materialistic traditions and
opinions of &lsquo;the Fathers,&rsquo; is a flat failure. By it the people of
great nations have been molded into servile submission to
church and ruler&ndash;&ndash;have been persuaded that wretchedness and
poverty are eternal&ndash;&ndash;that heaven is a realm beyond the grave,
to which admission is a function of outward oblation&ndash;&ndash;and that
surcease from ills here, or in the life to come, is a gift of the
Church. Can we wonder that commercialism is mistaken by
nations for progress? That king and emperor still call upon
God to bless their barbaric attempts at conquest? And that
human existence remains, what it has always been, a ghastly
mockery of Life?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Healing the sick by applied Christianity is not the attempt
to alter a mental concept; it is the bringing out of harmony
where before was discord. Evil can not be &lsquo;thought away.&rsquo;
He who indulges evil only proves his belief in its reality and
power. Christian healing is not &lsquo;mental suggestion,&rsquo; wherein
all thought is material. When evil thinking is overcome, then
the discords which result from it will disappear from consciousness.
That is the Christ-method. Behind all that the physical
senses seem to see, know, and feel, is the spiritual fact, perfect
and eternal. Jesus healed the sick by establishing this fact in
the human consciousness. And we must learn to do likewise.
The orthodox churches must learn it. They must cease from
the dust-man, whose breath is in his nostrils; they must cease
from preaching evil as an awful reality, permitted by God, or
existing despite Him; they must know it as Jesus bade all men
know it, as the lie about Truth. Then, by holding the divine
ideal before the human mind, they will cause that mentality
gradually to relinquish its false beliefs and copy the real. And
thus, step by step, changing from better to better beliefs, at
length the human mind will have completely substituted reality
for unreality, and will be no more, even in thought. The &lsquo;old
man&rsquo; will have given place to the &lsquo;new.&rsquo; This is the method of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_266' name='book4_page_266'></a>266</span>
Jesus. There is no other. Yes, for the present we reckon with
material symbols; we have not yet fully learned their unreality.
But at length, if we are faithful, we shall lay them aside, and
know only Truth and its pure manifestations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friends, how simple is Christianity! It is summed
up in the Sermon on the Mount. Our salvation is in righteousness.
He who thinks right shall know things as they are. He
who thinks wrong shall seem to know them as they are not,
and shall pass his days in sore travail, even in wars, famine,
and utter misery. Then why not take up the demonstration of
Christianity in the spirit of joy and freedom from prejudice
with which we pursue our earthly studies, and as gladly, thankfully
seek to prove it? For it, of all things, is worth while. It
alone is the true business of men. For if what we have
developed in our many talks regarding God, man, and the
mental nature of the universe and all things is true, then are
the things with which men now occupy themselves worth
while? No, decidedly no! But are the things which we have
developed true? Yes, for they can be and have been demonstrated.
Then, indeed, are we without excuse. Carmen has
shown us the way. No, she is not unnatural; she is only
divinely natural. She has shown us what we all may become,
if we but will. She has shown us what we shall be able to do
when we are completely lost in accord with God, and recognize
no other life, substance, nor law than His. But&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and
create evil,&rsquo; cried the prophet. <i>Truth always has its suppositional
opposite!</i> Choose ye then whom ye will serve. All is
subject to proof. Only that which is demonstrably true, not
after the change which we call death, but here this side of the
grave, can stand. The only test of a Christian is in the &lsquo;signs
following.&rsquo; Without them his faith is but sterile human belief,
and his god but the distorted human concept whom kings
beseech to bless their slaughter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
is he to be accounted of?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
day his thoughts perish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of
the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him
no more.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fire crackled briskly on the great hearth. Carmen rose
and turned off the light above them. All drew their chairs
about the cheery blaze.</p>
<p>Silence, sacred, holy, lay upon them. The rich man, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_267' name='book4_page_267'></a>267</span>
possessing treasures beyond his wildest dreams, sat holding his
daughter&rsquo;s hand. Her other hand lay in Jos&egrave;&rsquo;s. Sidney had
just entered; and Haynerd had sent word that he would join
them soon.</p>
<p>Then the silence was broken by the rich man. His voice
was unsteady and low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, sorrow and joy fill my heart to-night. To the
first I am resigned; it is my due; and yet, were it greater, I
know not how I could live. But the joy&ndash;&ndash;who can understand
it until he has passed through death into life! This little girl&rsquo;s
mother knew not, nor did I, that she was royal born. Sometimes
I wonder now if it is really so. And yet the evidence is
such that I can scarcely doubt. We met in the sun-kissed hills
of Granada; and we loved. Her old nurse was Argus-eyed; and
our meetings were such as only lovers can effect. I was young,
wild, and my blood coursed like a torrent through my veins!
But I loved her, yes, base though I was, I loved her. And in
these years since I left her in that little house in Bogot&aacute;, I have
suffered the agonies of the lost when her memory and my own
iniquity fell upon me and smote me sore&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were married in Spain, and the marriage was performed
by Padre Rafa&eacute;l de Rinc&oacute;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle!&rdquo; cried the startled Jos&egrave;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we fled,&rdquo; continued Ames. &ldquo;I was rich; I was
roaming the world, extending my vast business interests; and
I took her to Colombia, where I labored with the politicians in
Bogot&aacute; to grant me timber and cattle concessions. We had a
cottage on the outskirts of the city, where we were happy.
With us lived her faithful old nurse, whom she would not
leave in Spain&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, one day, came a cable message that my father had
died. The news transformed me. I knew I must return at
once to New York. But&ndash;&ndash;I would not take a wife back with
me! Why, I know not. I was mad! And I kissed her tear-stained
face, and bade her wait, for I would return and make
her happy. And then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Months later I wrote to her, and, receiving no reply, I
caused inquiry to be made. But she had gone&ndash;&ndash;whither, no one
knew. The old nurse, too, had disappeared. I never learned
that a woman had been left at Badillo to die. And she was not
known in Bogot&aacute;. She was timid, and went out seldom. And
then&ndash;&ndash;then I thought that a marriage here would strengthen my
position, for I was powerful and proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the years that her sad face haunted me! I was mad,
mad! I know not why, but when the <i>Cossack</i> was built I had
her portrait in glass set in the smoking room. And night after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_268' name='book4_page_268'></a>268</span>
night I have sat before it and cursed myself, and implored her
to forgive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the locket?&rdquo; said Father Waite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came from Spain. I was Guillermo to her, and she
Dolores to me. But I had never forgotten it. Had Carmen ever
worn it in my presence I must have recognized it at once. Oh,
God, that she had! What would it not have saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s arms were about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ames, choking down his sorrow, &ldquo;that man is
dead. He, like Goliath, fought Truth, and the Truth fell upon
him, crushing him to powder. The man who remains with you
now lives only in this little girl. And she has brought me my
own son, Sidney, and another, Jos&egrave;. All that I have is theirs,
and they will give it to the world. I would that she could have
brought me that noble black man, Rosendo, who laid down his
beautiful life when he saw that his work was done. I learn
from my inquiries that he and Do&ntilde;a Maria lived with Don
Nicol&aacute;s far up the Boque river during the troublous times
when Simit&iacute; was burned and devastated. And that, when the
troops had gone, they returned to their desolated home, and
died, within a month of each other. What do I not owe to
them! And can my care of their daughter Ana and her little
son ever cancel the debt? Alas, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sidney turned to the man. &ldquo;Father, does Jos&egrave; know that
it was Kathleen whom he rescued from the Tiber in Rome, years
ago, and who caused him to lose his notebook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another exclamation burst from Jos&egrave;. Ames shook his
head. &ldquo;No, Sidney, we had not told him. Ah, how small is
the world! And how inextricably bound together we all are!
And, Jos&egrave;, I have not told you that the woman who lived and
died alone in the limestone caves near Honda, and whose story
you had from Don Jorge in Simit&iacute;, was doubtless the faithful
old nurse of Dolores. My investigations all but confirm it.
Padre Rafa&eacute;l de Rinc&oacute;n maintained her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haynerd entered the room at that moment, and with him
came Miss Wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Hitt softly, &ldquo;the circle is complete. Carmen,
may I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose at once and went into the music room. Those
who remained sat in awed, expectant silence. Another presence
stole softly in, but they saw him not. Soon through the great
rooms and marble halls drifted the low, weird melody which
the girl had sung, long before, in the dreary Elwin school.</p>
<p>In the flickering light of the fire strange shapes took form;
and the shadows that danced on the walls silhouetted scenes
from the dimming past. From out their weird imagery rose a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='book4_page_269' name='book4_page_269'></a>269</span>
single form. Into it passed the unseen presence. Slowly it rose
before them from out the shadows. It was black of face, but its
wondrous heart which had cradled the nameless babe of
Badillo glistened like drifting snow.</p>
<p>The last sweet notes of the plaintive Indian lament fluttered
from the girl&rsquo;s lips, echoed among the marble pillars, and died
away down the distant corridors. She returned and bent over
her father with a tender caress.</p>
<p>Then the great black man in the shadows extended his arms
for a moment above them, and faded from their sight. There
was the sound of low weeping in the room. For</p>

<p>&ldquo;these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
